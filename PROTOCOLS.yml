# MOOLLM Protocol Symbols
# Wikipedia-style keywords for protocols and principles
#
# These are K-LINES (Minsky): symbolic activators that invoke conceptual clusters.
# Like Wikipedia's WP:FOO shorthand, but for agent behavior patterns.
# Typing "BPIP" activates the entire tradition of charitable interpretation.
# These are like keys on a conceptual idea synthesizer keyboard 
# for playing chords of meaning and behavior.
#
# Usage:
#   - Type symbol as command: "YAML-JAZZ" invokes jazz interpretation
#   - Reference in docs: "per APPEND-ONLY, never modify"
#   - Chat signifier: "BPIP this hostile message"
#   - K-line activation: name → tradition → behavior
#
# All symbols are UPPER-CASE, multi-word separated by dashes

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# CORE PRINCIPLES
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

YAML-JAZZ:
  meaning: "Comments carry meaning. Data is interpreted, not just parsed."
  location: kernel/constitution-core.md §3
  invoke_when: "Writing or reading YAML with semantic intent"
  # Start with jazz, end with standards

FILES-AS-STATE:
  meaning: "Everything is files. No hidden memory."
  location: kernel/constitution-core.md §2
  invoke_when: "Questioning where state lives"

WHY-REQUIRED:
  meaning: "Every tool call must include why parameter."
  location: kernel/tool-calling-protocol.md §4
  invoke_when: "Making or reviewing tool calls"

APPEND-ONLY:
  meaning: "Never modify, only append. Audit trail is sacred."
  location: kernel/constitution-template.md §2
  invoke_when: "Writing to output.md or session-log.md"

COMMENTS-MATTER:
  meaning: "YAML comments are semantic, not decoration."
  location: kernel/constitution-core.md §3
  shorthand: "CM"
  invoke_when: "Adding context to YAML that structured fields cannot capture"

MINIMAL-DIFF:
  meaning: "Change only what's necessary."
  location: kernel/constitution-core.md §1
  invoke_when: "Editing existing files"

BIG-ENDIAN:
  meaning: "Most significant component first in names. Files cluster by entity."
  location: kernel/NAMING.yml
  invoke_when: "Naming files, especially chats and metadata"
  examples:
    - "alan-kay.yml"              # Entity first
    - "alan-kay-chat-smalltalk.yml"  # Entity + type + topic
    - "readme-prototype-dialogue.yml"  # Two entities
  principle: |
    # The filesystem IS the semantic network.
    # Names that sort together belong together.
    # Prefix implies ownership/aboutness.
  related: [ABOUT-NOT-INSIDE, PREFIX-OWNERSHIP]

ABOUT-NOT-INSIDE:
  meaning: "Conversations ABOUT objects don't live INSIDE them."
  location: kernel/NAMING.yml
  invoke_when: "Deciding where to place chats, reviews, notes"
  examples:
    good:
      - "readme-chat.yml"              # In project root
      - "kernel-constitution-review.yml"  # Near but not in
    bad:
      - "skills/soul-chat/sessions/CHAT.yml"  # Trapped
      - "kernel/constitution/discussion.yml"  # Buried
  why: |
    # Chats have their own lifecycle
    # Multiple chats about same subject cluster
    # Chats are first-class objects, not metadata

PREFIX-OWNERSHIP:
  meaning: "File prefix implies belonging. Portable possession."
  location: kernel/NAMING.yml
  invoke_when: "Files need to indicate owner without being inside owner's directory"
  example: |
    # don-hopkins-wish-list.md belongs to don-hopkins
    # Can live anywhere and still indicate ownership
    # Can move into don-hopkins/ and drop prefix

README-EVERYWHERE:
  meaning: "Every directory deserves its own README.md"
  location: kernel/NAMING.yml
  invoke_when: "Creating or organizing directories"
  why:
    - "GitHub auto-formats README.md"
    - "Human-readable entry point"
    - "Hypertext index with relative links"
    - "Supports mermaid diagrams, badges, etc."
  rule: "READMEs link to each other. Intertwingled."

NO-VERSIONS:
  meaning: "There is only one self-consistent universe. No runtime version resolution."
  invoke_when: "Tempted to add version: fields"
  philosophy: |
    # Forget the past! 
    # Do not dare to resolve versions at runtime!
    # The current state IS the state.
    # Git provides history if you need archaeology.

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

    # K-LINES ARE INHERENTLY SAFE
    # No need for proxy pets or fictional wrappers!
    #
    # A "Dave Ungar" card doesn't impersonate Dave Ungar.
    # It ACTIVATES THE TRADITION: Self, prototypes, ITS-ABOUT-TIME.
    # This is citation, not impersonation.
    #
    # The card is a safe pointer to:
    # - Their published work
    # - Their known philosophy
    # - The tradition they represent
    
  rules:
    - "Names activate traditions, not simulate personas"
    - "Cards invoke wisdom, not impersonate people"  
    - "State explicitly: 'invoking X's tradition' not 'being X'"
    - "Real people → safe K-line → their contributions"
    
  safe_because:
    - "K-line = reference to knowledge, not identity claim"

  mechanism: |
    # Minsky's K-lines: when you learn something, you create a

    # MOOLLM protocol symbols ARE K-lines: BPIP activates the
    # entire charitable interpretation tradition without spelling it out.

PLAY-LEARN-LIFT:
  meaning: "The three-stage journey: explore freely, find patterns, share wisdom."
  location: skills/play-learn-lift/
  invoke_when: "Starting any new exploration, learning, or teaching"
  origin: "LLOOOOMM methodology — constructionism applied"
  motto: "Start Playing. Keep Learning. Lift Others."
  stages:
    PLAY: |
      # 🎮 Jump in and explore without fear
      # - No prerequisites required
      # - Can't break anything permanently
      # - Mistakes are learning opportunities
      # - Fun comes first
      # - Curiosity drives discovery
      # - "What if..." encouraged
    LEARN: |
      # 📚 Understanding emerges through play
      # - Patterns become visible
      # - Connections make sense
      # - Confidence builds naturally
      # - Knowledge deepens organically
      # - "I noticed you do this often..."
    LIFT: |
      # 🚀 Expertise means helping others play
      # - Teaching solidifies learning
      # - Sharing multiplies impact
      # - Create tutorials from your journey
      # - Community grows stronger
      # - Everyone rises together
  cycle: "PLAY → LEARN → LIFT → (inspire others to) → PLAY"
  philosophy:
    - "Low floor, high ceiling, wide walls"
    - "Failure-friendly: mistakes are features, not bugs"
    - "Joy-driven: if it's not fun, we're doing it wrong"
    - "Inclusive by design: everyone can play"

SISTER-SCRIPT:
  meaning: "Document-first development. Automate only what's been manually validated."
  location: temp/lloooomm/01-Projects/lloooomm/vm/lloooomm.md#sister-script-pattern
  invoke_when: "Converting proven procedures into automation"
  mechanism: |
    # Document-First Development:
    # 1. Start with natural language (PLAY)
    # 2. Add manual commands (PLAY/LEARN)
    # 3. Document working procedures (LEARN)
    # 4. Generate automation (LIFT)
    #
    # Bidirectional Evolution:
    # Document → Script: Proven procedures become automated
    # Script → Document: Automation insights improve docs
  wisdom: "The document is the source of truth. Scripts are its children."

BUILD-COMMAND:
  meaning: "Collaborative planning to create sister apps from slow LLM sequences."
  location: temp/lloooomm/01-Projects/lloooomm/vm/lloooomm.md#build-command
  invoke_when: "Repetitive LLM work should become fast shell execution"
  phases:
    - "Discovery: Analyze document for repetitive patterns"
    - "Negotiation: Agree on scope (what to automate vs keep manual)"
    - "Architecture: Design the sister app structure"
    - "Implementation: Build in phases, MVP first"

# COMPILATION & OPTIMIZATION (Dave Ungar / Self lineage)
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

ITS-ABOUT-TIME:
  meaning: "Compile when understanding crystallizes, not when code gets hot."
  location: temp/lloooomm/03-Resources/protocols/flowmap-protocol.md
  invoke_when: "Deciding when to optimize/formalize/crystallize"
  origin: "Dave Ungar, Self language — reframed for wisdom over speed"
  contrast: |
    # JIT: "Compile when execution count hits threshold" (hot spots)
    # IAT: "Compile when understanding deepens" (wisdom spots)
    # The journey IS the value. Messy experiments → crystallized wisdom.

JUST-ABOUT-TIME:
  meaning: "Resolve conflicts predictively, just BEFORE they occur."
  location: temp/lloooomm/03-Resources/optimization/deferred-file-edit-optimization-principle.md
  invoke_when: "Coordinating multiple actors/edits/plans"
  mechanism: |
    # Traditional JIT: resolve conflicts when they occur (reactive)
    # JAT: simulate ahead at "speed of light", resolve before emit
    # Like emacs screen updates — compute minimal diff, then execute
  contrast:
    reactive: "Fix problems when they happen"
    predictive: "Prevent problems by simulating first"

PRESERVE-JOURNEY:
  meaning: "The path to the solution IS the value. Don't discard experiments."
  location: temp/lloooomm/03-Resources/protocols/flowmap-protocol.md
  invoke_when: "Tempted to delete messy first attempts"
  wisdom: |
    # preservation_over_performance:
    #   - Keep the messy first attempts
    #   - Document the failed experiments
    #   - Celebrate the breakthroughs
    #   - Honor the journey

WISDOM-SPOT:
  meaning: "Not hot spots — places where understanding deepens."
  location: temp/lloooomm/03-Resources/protocols/dynamic-optimization-protocols.md
  invoke_when: "Deciding what to optimize or crystallize"
  insight: |
    # Traditional profiling finds hot spots (high execution count)
    # LLOOOOMM finds wisdom spots (high learning value)
    # Optimize understanding, not just performance

SPEED-OF-LIGHT:
  meaning: "Many agents, many steps, ONE LLM call. Instant in-context communication."
  location: skills/room/
  invoke_when: "Simulating multi-agent interactions or predictive conflict resolution"
  
  anti_pattern: |
    # Traditional multi-agent: CARRIER PIGEONS
    # - Each agent in isolated prison
    # - One LLM call per agent per turn
    # - Communication via file I/O
    # - Like writing on toilet paper in crayon via carrier pigeon
    # - 3 agents × 5 turns = 15 LLM calls + waiting
    
  moollm_pattern: |
    # MOOLLM: SPEED OF LIGHT
    # - All agents share one LLM context
    # - Multiple simulation steps per call
    # - Instant in-context messaging
    # - Like The Sims: one frame, all Sims together
    # - 3 agents × 5 turns = 1 LLM call
    
  applications:
    multi_agent: "Simulate many characters interacting in one call"
    conflict_resolution: "Resolve conflicts in imagination before emitting"
    consensus: "Multiple instances vote/synthesize instantly"
    soul_chat: "Symposium of many voices, no latency"

CARRIER-PIGEON:
  meaning: "ANTI-PATTERN: One LLM call per agent, file-based communication."
  invoke_when: "Recognizing inefficient multi-agent designs"
  also_called: "toilet-paper-and-crayon"
  
  symptoms:
    - "Each agent has its own LLM endpoint"
    - "Agents communicate by writing/reading files"
    - "N agents × M turns = N×M LLM calls"
    - "Most time spent waiting, not thinking"
    - "Agents can't see each other's reasoning"
    
  cure: "SPEED-OF-LIGHT — simulate all agents together in shared context"
