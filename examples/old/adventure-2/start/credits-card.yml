          contribution: |
            The entire adventure runs on MOOLLM — the filesystem-as-microworld
            operating system that treats directories as rooms, files as objects,
            and YAML as physics. Without this architecture, none of this exists.

            Constructionism — the idea that learning happens best when you build
            things you can inspect, modify, and share. The entire PLAY-LEARN-LIFT

            vision, Smalltalk, and the idea of computers as expressive media

            Created the original ADVENTURE (1975-76) based on his experiences

            Expanded and polished Crowther's ADVENTURE in 1977, adding puzzles,

            Hid the first Easter egg in video game history. Also created
            Rocky's Boots and Robot Odyssey — profound influences on MOOLLM's
            room-as-machine metaphor.

            Made "Get Lamp" (2010), the definitive documentary about text

            a direct tribute to his work preserving this history.

            The lamp appears in almost every classic adventure game. It

            The Sims' food preparation system — where characters autonomously
            find ingredients, cook, and eat — inspired our food-as-maze-marker
            system. The action queue, advertisements, and SimAntics all descend

            Made the original Logo Adventure for C64 where the command line
            WAS the parser. Users could "cheat" by learning Logo commands.

            The Sims' character creation screen — where you can endlessly

            The German countertenor and new wave artist (1944-1983) whose
            dramatic capes, operatic style, and fearless self-transformation
            inspired both our capes and our understanding of costume as identity.

            Marc Okrand created the Klingon language for Star Trek. The
            warrior culture, the battle songs, the honor codes — all
            provided the framework for our pre-battle opera.

            The grue is darkness incarnate. Created for Zork by Infocom, 
            feared by generations. We killed one with cheese. It deserved 
            a better death. It also deserved to be eaten.
