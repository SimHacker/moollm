  lyrics: |
    === VERSE 1: THE BEGINNING ===
    
    I woke up in a dungeon with no memory of how,
    Just a waistcoat and a promise that I'd make my mama proud!
    She said "Find treasure, don't waste food, and DON'T get eaten please!"
    So I grabbed the lamp and ventured forth upon my hands and knees!
    
    === CHORUS ===
    
    Oh, the treasure! The TREASURE! It gleams in golden light!
    I followed nose and oracle through darkness of the night!
    And when I tell my mama what her Bumblewick has done,
    She'll be INSUFFERABLE for weeks — but oh, I think I've WON!
    
    === VERSE 2: THE TRANSFORMATION ===
    
    In the coat room I met Maurice, a mannequin of class,
    He dressed me as a Belter and he kicked my proper... waistcoat!
    I became Captain Ashford with a cape of midnight black,
    And made my mama one as well — Klaus Nomi front and back!
    
    === CHORUS (variation) ===
    
    Oh, the treasure! The TREASURE! It gleams in golden light!
    I sent my mama fashion through the Dungeon Post tonight!
    A cape of emerald glory with a note that says "I care,"
    She'll wear it to the dungeons and she'll SLAY beyond compare!
    
    === VERSE 3: THAT SMELL ===
    
    I ate a birthday cake and watched it find philosophy,
    I ate a magic apple and it showed the maze to me!
    But the GREATEST transformation — the one that marks my name —
    Was eating that hard-boiled egg and WEAPONIZING SHAME!
    
    === BRIDGE ===
    
    That SMELL! That SMELL! It echoes through the halls!
    The Sulfurous Beacon rising, bouncing off the walls!
    The grues they run in terror, the treasure holds its breath,
    My egg became a LIGHTHOUSE steering ships away from death!
    
    === VERSE 4: THE ORACLE'S GIFT ===
    
    The apple, oh the apple, suspiciously divine,
    It put me in a coma and it showed me every line!
    The maze laid out before me like a star chart in the void,
    "Go WEST to D, then NORTH," it said — the path could not be toyed!
    
    === CHORUS (navigation) ===
    
    Oh, the treasure! The TREASURE! I hold it in my hands!
    The chalice gleams with rubies red and emeralds from strange lands!
    The Oracle Core is glowing and the Beacon marks the way,
    I navigated by my NOSE — it's been a FRAGRANT day!
    
    === VERSE 5: FOR MOTHER ===
    
    Now mama, when I see you, I'll present this golden cup,
    And you'll say "Bumblewick, my boy, I knew you'd measure up!"
    You gave me food for markers and a lamp to light the dark,
    You gave me love and courage and a catastrophic... digestive tract!
    
    === FINAL CHORUS ===
    
    Oh, the treasure! The TREASURE! It's everything you dreamed!
    Your son became a CAPTAIN and a HERO (so it seemed)!
    I didn't waste the food, mama — I TRANSFORMED it into ART!
    The Sulfurous Beacon proves that I've got TREASURE in my heart!
    
    === OUTRO (spoken, Belter patois) ===
    
    "Oye, Mama... mi pensa ere proud, yeah?
    Your Bumblewick... he come home rich.
    Rich in gold. Rich in story.
    Rich in... olfactory legacy.
    Da treasure? It's for you.
    Da smell? ...also for you.
    Mi love you, Mama.
    Even when you insufferable."

  legacy: |
    The third and greatest composition of Captain Ashford's adventure.
    
    1. "The Fantastipants Victory Ballad" — celebrated the lamp
    2. "The Prophecy Shanty" — justified eating the apple
    3. "The Ballad of the Belter's Treasure" — THE VICTORY ANTHEM
    
    This song captures the entire journey: from confused awakening
    to triumphant treasure-holder. It immortalizes the Sulfurous
    Beacon, thanks Mother, and proves that catastrophic digestion
    can be a SUPERPOWER.
    
    Sung in treasuries for generations to come.
