## The Moment

Captain Ashford upends his pouch. 108 gold coins cascade onto the kitchen table
like a waterfall of wealth. Mother's hands fly to her mouth. The coins bounce, 
spin, scatter — catching the light, filling the kitchen with golden reflections.

This is more gold than she's ever seen. This is the skeleton's hoard, finally claimed.

## Prompt

Action shot: Gold coins mid-pour, cascading from a leather pouch onto a wooden 
kitchen table. Some coins are still in the air, spinning. Some have landed, 
bouncing. The whole scene is alive with golden motion.

Captain Ashford grins triumphantly, pouch tilted. Mother's hands are at her 
mouth, eyes wide with delighted shock. Both wear their Nomi capes.

Gold reflections dance across their faces, the walls, the ceiling.

**Style:** Dynamic action photography, frozen motion, warm golden light 
dominating the palette. Wealth as waterfall.

**Mood:** "We're RICH, Mother! WE'RE RICH!!!"
