## The Moment

Mother grabs Ashford's hands. "Maurice taught me the twirl!" she says.
"Show me!" he replies.

They spin together. The capes BILLOW.

Purple lightning meets cosmic stars. Klaus Nomi smiles from beyond.

## Prompt

Two figures mid-twirl in a kitchen, matching capes flying dramatically.

**Mother's cape:** Deep purple with silver lightning bolts, catching the light,
spreading like wings.

**Ashford's cape:** Space-black with cosmic patterns, stars and nebulae 
visible in the fabric, swirling like a galaxy in motion.

Both figures are laughing, hands clasped, feet barely touching the ground.
The kitchen spins around them — gold coins, chalice, pie, all blurred by motion.

**Style:** Dynamic, joyful, frozen moment of pure play. Fashion photography 
meets family snapshot. The capes are the stars.

**Mood:** "We match. We've ALWAYS matched. We just needed the capes to prove it."
