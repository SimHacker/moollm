## The Moment

Captain Ashford holds up the Gorgonzola Glaive — a wedge of blue cheese, 
impossibly sharp, still faintly glowing with weaponized mold energy.

Mother's expression is... complex. Pride? Confusion? Concern for her son's 
sanity? All three?

"You killed a grue... with CHEESE?"

"Mother, I didn't just kill it. I ATE it."

## Prompt

Captain Ashford holding up a wedge of blue cheese like a legendary weapon.
The cheese is improbably sharp-edged, with visible blue veins that seem to pulse.
His expression is pure pride, the pride of a warrior displaying his weapon.

Mother leans back slightly, one eyebrow raised, expression mixing maternal 
pride with "I'm not sure what to do with this information." Her purple cape 
frames her skeptical pose.

**Style:** Comedy portrait, the contrast between the absurd weapon and the 
serious presentation. Deadpan delivery of ridiculous content.

**Mood:** "Yes, Mother. Cheese. It's a long story. The grue started it."
