# Image Prompt: Tender Pride

**Costume:** The Adventurer Emerita: Nomi Edition  
**Subject:** Bumblewick Fantastipants (or Petunia)  
**Expression:** Tender Pride

---

## Prompt

A close-up portrait capturing a moment of genuine emotion breaking through the theatrical costume. The expression is soft pride — eyes slightly glistening (NOT crying, just... dust), a gentle smile, the look of someone thinking about their mother or their child and feeling overwhelming love.

This is the expression of Bumblewick thinking: "Mother is going to love this." Or Petunia thinking: "My son sent me this."

The dramatic Klaus Nomi costume frames this tender moment, creating beautiful contrast between the avant-garde exterior and the genuine heart within.

**Style:** Intimate portrait. Soft focus on edges. The costume drama fades; the human emotion is center. Natural, warm lighting.

**Details to include:**
- Eyes with slight shine (emotion, not tears, OBVIOUSLY)
- Genuine soft smile, not performed
- Relaxed facial muscles despite dramatic costume
- Art deco collar softened by lighting
- One hand possibly touching the locket
- The vulnerability beneath the armor of fashion

**Mood:** Love, gratitude, the moment before happy tears, family bonds
