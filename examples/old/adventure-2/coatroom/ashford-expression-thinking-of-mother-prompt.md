## Prompt

Close-up portrait of Captain Ashford's face in a rare vulnerable moment. The hard Belter mask has slipped. Underneath: Bumblewick Fantastipants, thinking about his mother.

The eyes are soft, slightly unfocused, looking at something in memory. The tough set of the jaw has relaxed. There might be moisture in those eyes — space dust, surely.

This is the face Maurice sees. The face only those closest see. The son beneath the captain.

**Style:** Intimate portrait. The private face. Armor temporarily down.

**Details to include:**
- Eyes soft, slightly distant, seeing memory
- Jaw relaxed from its usual set
- Lips slightly parted, as if about to say something
- Slight head tilt, vulnerability in angle
- Eyes possibly wet (definitely space dust)
- Burgundy scarf suddenly looking like something a mother would give
- Expression of love and longing

**Mood:** "She knew. She always knew. And she loved me anyway."

- Color palette: Warm, soft, intimate — the burgundy scarf draws focus
- Lighting: Very soft, diffused, the light of a safe moment
