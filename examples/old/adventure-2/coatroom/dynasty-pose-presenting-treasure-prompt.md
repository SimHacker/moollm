## Prompt

A ceremonial pose: Captain Ashford kneeling, presenting an imaginary treasure upward to his standing mother. The classic "hero returns with prize" composition.

**Captain Ashford** (kneeling): Space-black Nomi cape pooled dramatically around him. Both hands extended upward, cupped as if holding something precious. Head bowed slightly, but eyes looking up at her. The returning hero.

**Petunia Fantastipants** (standing): Burgundy cape flowing down, one hand extended gracefully toward the offered treasure, the other hand over her heart. Expression of genuine surprise and pride she's trying to hide.

The pose tells a story: every adventure ends with coming home. Every treasure is really just proof that you survived.

**Style:** Classical painting composition. Hero's return iconography. Emotional family portrait.

**Details to include:**
- Him kneeling, cape creating pool of black velvet
- Her standing regally, cape flowing
- His hands cupped, presenting upward
- Her hand reaching down gracefully
- Eye contact between them — love, pride, relief
- Geometric shoulders creating height contrast
- Space between hands glowing (the imaginary treasure)

**Mood:** "I promised you treasure. Here it is. But the real treasure is coming home."
