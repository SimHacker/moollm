## Prompt

Close-up portrait of Captain Ashford's face, wearing a particular kind of smile — the Belter grin. It's the smile of someone who's been through hell and found it funny. Not cruel, but knowing. The smile of a survivor who can't believe they're still here.

Crows feet at the corners of eyes that have seen too much. The perpetual five-day stubble. The eye patch pushed up on the forehead like a hat.

Above the smile: eyes that are genuinely warm. This man has hurt people and saved people and he carries both.

**Style:** Character portrait. The face of a complicated hero. Weathered but warm.

**Details to include:**
- Asymmetric smile, one side higher than the other
- Genuine warmth in eyes despite hard face
- Five-day stubble, theatrically applied
- Small scar across chin
- Eye patch pushed up on forehead
- Collar of space-black Nomi cape framing jaw
- Burgundy scarf visible at neck

**Mood:** "You think this is bad? Beratna, I have STORIES."
