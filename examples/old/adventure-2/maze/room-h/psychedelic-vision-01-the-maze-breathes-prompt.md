## The Vision

The mushrooms take hold and suddenly you are ABOVE the maze, floating in a void 
of swirling colors. Below you, the maze BREATHES — walls expanding and contracting
like the lungs of some vast, dreaming creature.

Each room pulses with its own color:
- **Room A** glows apple-red, the Oracle Core at its heart
- **Room B** radiates warm bread-gold
- **Room C** spirals with cheese-yellow fractals
- **Room D** throbs sulfurous yellow-green
- **Room E** crowns itself in purple grape-royalty
- **Room F** flickers blue-cheese blue (and void-ichor black)
- **Room G** shimmers pickled silver
- **Room H** (where your body sits) pulses sickly green — THE CENTER
- **Room I** mourns in shepherd's-pie brown
- **Room J** sweetens to strawberry pink

The markers you've left are VISIBLE — glowing nodes in a living network.
The mycelium connects them ALL.

**You have not been mapping the maze. The maze has been mapping YOU.**

## Prompt

Aerial/bird's-eye view of a living, breathing maze structure. The maze is 
biological, organic, made of pulsing fungal tissue. Each chamber glows a 
different color corresponding to the food markers left within. Fractal 
patterns extend from each room, connecting through luminescent mycelium 
networks. The perspective shifts impossibly, Escher-like, as if the maze 
exists in multiple dimensions simultaneously.

At the center, a single human figure (Captain Ashford in Nomi cape) sits 
cross-legged, surrounded by mushrooms, a single eye (The Thing That Watches) 
gazing up from beside them.

**Style:** Alex Grey's sacred geometry meets M.C. Escher's impossible spaces,
with a bioluminescent color palette. Deep blacks, vivid neon colors, 
fractal edges, overwhelming detail.

**Mood:** "You are small. The maze is vast. But you are CONNECTED."
