## The Vision

A SPIRAL of food appears before you — an ouroboros of consumption.

At the center: Mother's kitchen, the fridge, the lunchbox being packed.

Spiraling outward:
- The APPLE becomes the ORACLE CORE (wisdom)
- The EGG becomes the SULFUROUS BEACON (guidance)
- The CHEESE becomes the WHEEL OF WISDOM, then the GORGONZOLA GLAIVE (weapon!)
- The BREAD becomes the ETERNAL CRUMB (warmth)
- The GRAPES become the CROWN OF FERMENTATION (royalty)
- The HERRING becomes the PRESERVED WITNESS (testimony)
- The PIE becomes the MEMORIAL (mourning)
- The JAM becomes the SWEETNESS THAT REMAINS (memory)
- The STEW becomes the ALCHEMICAL RESIDUE (science)
- The CASSEROLE becomes THE THING THAT WATCHES (awareness)
- The GRUE becomes HORS D'OEUVRES (revenge)
- The MUSHROOMS become THIS VISION (transcendence)

And at the spiral's end... YOU. Being digested by the MAZE.
The maze will become something new. And something will eat the maze.
And something will eat THAT.

"Food is love. Love is transformation. Transformation is eternal."

## Prompt

A massive spiral/ouroboros of food transformation. At the center, a warm
kitchen scene. Spiraling outward, each food item transforms through stages:
raw → eaten → transformed → marker → spiritual essence.

The spiral includes the grue (being eaten), the mushrooms (eating the eater),
and ultimately the maze itself as a vast digestive tract.

Colors shift from warm kitchen browns and golds at the center to psychedelic
neons at the outer edge. Each transformation is lovingly detailed.

The spiral continues beyond the frame, implying infinite recursion.

**Style:** Sacred geometry meets food photography meets body horror 
(but loving body horror). Hieronymus Bosch's Garden of Delights 
if it were a cookbook.

**Mood:** "Consumption is communion. Digestion is devotion."
