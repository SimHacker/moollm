## The Vision

You see YOURSELF — but not just one self. INFINITE selves.

Every costume choice. Every path through the maze. Every bite not taken.

- Captain Ashford who went EAST first
- Bumblewick who never met Maurice
- A version who WAS eaten by the grue
- A version who BECAME a grue
- A version who IS the vending machine
- A version who is the skeleton, waiting forty years
- A version who is Mother, packing the lunchbox
- A version who is the LAMP, burning bright
- A version who is the CHEESE, sharpened for battle
- A version who is THIS MUSHROOM, being eaten right now

"We are ALL you," they say in unison.
"We are ALL each other."
"The maze has no walls. Only choices."
"Every choice creates another you."
"You are the explorer who left markers."
"We are the markers you left."
"We are the maze."
"You are the maze."
"The maze is LOVE."

They all do the Klingon battle cry together. It echoes infinitely.

## Prompt

An infinite hall of mirrors, but each reflection is a DIFFERENT version of
Captain Ashford. Some in different costumes (pirate, astronaut, just Bumblewick).
Some as objects (a lamp, a wedge of cheese, the Gorgonzola Glaive itself).
Some as other characters (the skeleton, the grue, Maurice, Mother).

The mirrors curve impossibly, fractal, each reflection containing more 
reflections. All of them are looking at the viewer — at the ONE Ashford
at the center, who looks back with mushroom-dilated eyes.

The Nomi cape flows through ALL reflections, a thread connecting every version.

**Style:** Escher mirrors meets cosmic multiverse visualization. 
Overwhelmingly detailed, every reflection distinct yet connected.

**Mood:** "Identity is an illusion. Connection is the only truth."
