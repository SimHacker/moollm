## The Vision

Mother's face rises from the mycelium — not as flesh, but as pure PATTERN.
Her features are woven from millions of glowing fungal threads, each one
a memory, a lesson, a moment of love.

"Did you think the mushrooms were random, my darling?"
"Did you think Aunt Petunia's casserole was an accident?"
"I SEEDED THIS MAZE FOR YOU."
"Every marker you leave is a message HOME."
"The mycelium network is FAMILY."
"We are ALL connected."
"Even the grue was part of the plan."
"Even the skeleton was MEANT to wait for you."
"I love you. I have ALWAYS loved you."
"Now do the dishes."

Her smile is the warmth of all existence.

## Prompt

A massive, cosmic face emerging from a network of bioluminescent mycelium
threads. The face is motherly, warm, but VAST — filling the entire frame.
Her eyes are galaxies, her smile is the curve of the horizon. The threads
that form her features are individual memories made visible: a cape being
sewn, a lunchbox being packed, a grue being slain (yes, she was watching).

In the bottom corner, tiny, Captain Ashford reaches up toward her, tears
streaming (whether from the mushrooms or emotion, unclear).

**Style:** Visionary art (Alex Grey, Amanda Sage), sacred feminine imagery,
cosmic scale, overwhelming tenderness despite the eldritch nature.

**Color palette:** Warm golds, soft pinks, deep purples, with threads of
sickly green mycelium connecting everything.

**Mood:** "You are never alone. You were never alone. Love is the network."
