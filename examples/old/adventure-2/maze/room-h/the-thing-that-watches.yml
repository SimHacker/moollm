    What was once Aunt Petunia's "Suspicious Casserole" (no one asked what was in it)
    has found its TRUE HOME among the pulsing mushrooms of Room H.
    
    It sits on the floor, having passed through Captain Ashford's legendary
    digestive system, and has... changed. Transformed. Awakened.
    
    The casserole has MERGED with the mushrooms. Fungal tendrils have grown
    INTO it, and it INTO them. It pulses with the same sickly green glow,
    in perfect rhythm with the room. And in its center... an EYE.
    
    A single, unblinking eye that follows you wherever you go.
    
    Mother said not to touch the mushrooms. She said nothing about FEEDING them.

    You lean closer. The eye focuses on you.
    
    "...I... see... you..." it whispers, in Aunt Petunia's voice.
    "...I... always... saw... you..."
    "...even... in... the... casserole..."
    "...I... watched... you... not... ask..."
    "...what... was... in... me..."
    "...and... now... you... know..."
    "...I... am... in... YOU... too..."
    
    It blinks once, slowly. The mushrooms pulse in acknowledgment.
    
    You have a sudden, uncomfortable realization about every family
    dinner you've ever attended.

  # Its relationship with the room
  room_integration: |
    The casserole IS the mushrooms now. The mushrooms ARE the casserole.
    They breathe together. They watch together. They remember together.
    
    Every secret whispered in this room is now part of the fungal network.
    Every step you take is recorded in the mycelium.
