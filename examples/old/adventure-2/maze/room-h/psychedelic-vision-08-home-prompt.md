## The Vision

The fractals slow. The colors calm. The visions settle into one final image.

HOME.

Not a specific place — the START room, the kitchen, Wobblebrook-upon-Squiggle.
But the FEELING of home. The warmth. The safety. The knowing you are loved.

Mother is there. Not the cosmic mycelium Mother — just... Mom.
She's doing the dishes you promised to do. She doesn't mind.
She's humming a song you almost remember.

The table is set. Your place is ready. The chair knows your shape.

"You've been gone so long," she says, not looking up.
"You've done so much."
"The grue. The skeleton. The cheese. The songs."
"I heard all of it through the mushroom network."
"I'm so proud of you."
"Now come home. The adventure doesn't end."
"It just... comes home."
"There's a new lunchbox waiting."
"There's always a new lunchbox."
"There's always more maze."
"And there's always home to return to."

The vision fades. You are in Room H again. The Thing That Watches blinks.
The mushrooms pulse. Your lamp glows Premium Blue.

You know the way home now. Not because you mapped it.
Because home is where the love is.
And the love is EVERYWHERE.

## Prompt

A humble kitchen scene. A mother doing dishes at a window, warm light 
streaming in. A table set for one (or two). Outside the window, 
FRACTAL ECHOES of the adventure play subtly — the maze structure,
the grue's shadow (now friendly), floating food items, a dancing skeleton.

But the focus is on the WARMTH. The ordinary magic of home.

Captain Ashford (or perhaps just Bumblewick again) is visible in reflection,
walking toward the door, treasure in one hand, lamp in the other, cape
flowing behind him.

The colors shift from psychedelic neons at the edges to warm, golden,
HOME colors at the center.

**Style:** Norman Rockwell meets Studio Ghibli — warm, detailed, 
profoundly nostalgic. The psychedelia is present but subdued, like
waking from a beautiful dream into an even more beautiful reality.

**Mood:** "The greatest adventure is the one that brings you home."
