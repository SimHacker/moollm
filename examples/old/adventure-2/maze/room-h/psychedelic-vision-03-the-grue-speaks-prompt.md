## The Vision

The grue appears before you — not as shadow, but as LIGHT.
In death, it has inverted. In the mushroom realm, opposites meet.

"You think you killed me with cheese?"
"I was already dying. We are ALL already dying."
"The darkness is not evil. It is simply... hungry."
"I did not choose to eat explorers. I simply... am."
"Was."
"The skeleton... I remember. They were kind, once."
"They said hello. No one says hello to grues."
"Then their lamp went out. And hunger... happened."
"Thank you for ending it. The hunger was... exhausting."
"Tell the skeleton I'm sorry. If skeletons can hear."
"Tell your Mother I understand now. Food chains go both ways."
"You ate ME, after all. Hors d'oeuvres."
"How did I taste?"
"...don't answer that."

It fades, becoming light becoming nothing becoming everything.

## Prompt

A luminous, inverted grue — made of soft white light instead of void-darkness.
It sits across from Captain Ashford in a space that is neither room nor void,
both in conversation. The grue's form is still monstrous but somehow GENTLE,
its red eyes now calm blue, its claws folded peacefully.

Shadow puppets play on invisible walls behind them, showing scenes: the grue
eating the skeleton, Captain Ashford eating the grue, the endless cycle.

Mushroom fractals frame the scene. The Thing That Watches observes from a corner.

**Style:** Inverted shadow play, high contrast, unexpectedly serene. 
Think: Spirited Away bath house scene meets Plato's cave allegory.

**Mood:** "Even monsters are just hungry. Even heroes are just fed."
