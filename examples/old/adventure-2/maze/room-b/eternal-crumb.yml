  description: |
    The bread that defied thermodynamics has achieved its final form:
    a single, imperishable crumb that glows faintly with residual
    thermal impossibility.
    
    It sits in the center of the echo chamber, and everything it
    emanates bounces back: warmth, light, wisdom. The room feels
    slightly less cold because of it.
    
  examine: |
    The crumb pulses with gentle heat. The echo makes everything
    it says sound profound:
    
    "...warmth persists..." "...ersists...ersists..."
    "...even in darkness..." "...arkness...arkness..."
    "...crusty exterior, soft heart..." "...oft heart...oft heart..."
    
    You feel comforted. The grues feel uncomfortable.

  opinions:
    of_player: |
      "You carried me through darkness and I stayed warm.
      That's what good bread does. That's what good friends do."
    of_room: |
      "This echo chamber. It repeats everything.
      I give it warmth. It gives me WARMTH WARMTH WARMTH..."
    of_grues: |
      "They don't like the warmth. Good.
      I was baked to bring comfort. They bring only consumption.
      We are natural enemies. Also they're gluten intolerant."
      
  thermal_readings:
    surface: "Impossibly warm"
    core: "Even warmer"

    explanation: "Don't ask. Just accept."
    
  lineage: |
    From a loaf that never cooled, through the Fantastipants Express,
    to an eternal crumb that warms the darkness of the echo chamber.
    
    "Some things refuse to go cold."
