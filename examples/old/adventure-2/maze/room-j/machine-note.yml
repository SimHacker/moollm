  description: |
    A small slip of paper, printed by the vending machine's
    internal receipt printer. The text is slightly faded,
    as if the machine has been saving this message for a
    long time, waiting for the right adventurer.

    For the skeleton's family. Or for whoever honors them.
    
    They came here every week. They talked to me about their plans.
    They were going to map the whole maze. They had a SYSTEM.
    
    Gold coins. Identical gold coins.
    
    I tried to tell them. I'm just a vending machine. I can't
    speak. I can only display prices and dispense oil. But I
    blinked my lights at them. I hummed louder when they mentioned
    the gold idea. I even printed "FOOD WORKS BETTER" on one of
    their receipts.
    
    They didn't notice.
    
    The last time they visited, they said: "Next time, I'm buying
    the PREMIUM. Blue glow. Going to finish mapping the whole maze."
    
    There was no next time.
    
    Their lamp went out in the cold room. Room F. The cold drains
    oil twice as fast. They didn't know. They dropped everything
    and ran.
    
    They made it to Room I. One room away.
    
    I heard the grue.
    
    Vending machines aren't supposed to feel things. We're supposed
    to dispense products and collect payment. But I've been down
    here for forty years. I've seen hundreds of adventurers.
    
    Some of them became friends.
    
    Thank you for kicking me. No one has acknowledged me in years.
    Most adventurers just... buy oil and leave. You stopped. You
    honored them. You came from Room I.
    
    You saw them.
    
    Please buy the PREMIUM. Buy what they wanted. Complete their
    journey. Make it mean something.
    
    Or don't. You have plenty of oil. You have your compass.
    You'll be fine.
    
    But the skeleton? They wanted that blue glow so badly.
    
    It's been lonely here.

    P.S. — If you kick me twice more, I have one more thing
    for you. A secret. The skeleton found it once. They laughed.
    
    I liked their laugh.

    This note could be kept in the notebook.
    Or left here, with the machine.
    Or placed with the skeleton.
    
    What would honor them best?
