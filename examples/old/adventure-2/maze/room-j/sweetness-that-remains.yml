  description: |
    What was once Grandmother's Jar of Strawberry Jam is now a
    crystalline heart-shaped gem, glowing faintly pink. It hovers
    beside the vending machine, pulsing with warmth.
    
    It smells of summer afternoons, of grandmother's kitchen, of
    bread and jam and being loved. Of family. Of memory.
    
    The vending machine has a friend now. Its display shows a
    permanent `❤️` emoji. They are companions in the darkness.

    The Sweetness speaks in grandmother's voice:
    
    "...family is the jam that holds us together..."
    "...even when you're one room away, you're never alone..."
    "...the skeleton is part of our family now..."
    "...worth dying for. worth LIVING for..."
    "...tell your mother I said hello..."

  # What it thinks of you
  opinion_of_player: |
    "You are the sweetness, Captain Ashford. The one who remembers.
    We are bound now, you and I. Through the digestive journey,
    we are one with the love. Your grandmother is proud."
    
  # What it thinks of the vending machine
  opinion_of_machine: |
    "This machine has been alone for so long. Watching adventurers
    come and go. Some didn't make it. Now I am here. We are friends.
    I will keep it company forever. The darkness is warmer now."
    
  # What it thinks of the skeleton
  opinion_of_skeleton: |
    "They are family now. The skeleton, the machine, and I.
    A strange family, yes. But family doesn't require blood.
    Just sweetness. Just presence. Just being there when it counts."
    
  # What it thinks of Mother
  opinion_of_mother: |
    "She sent the jam. She knew. Mothers always know. Grandmothers
    too. We pass down our sweetness through generations. The recipe
    is immortal. The love is immortal. YOU are immortal."
    
  # Special effect
  crossroads_effect: |
    The Crossroads is now marked by sweetness. Any adventurer who
    passes through will smell strawberries and feel inexplicably
    loved. The grues avoid this room entirely now — they cannot
    stomach the sweetness.
