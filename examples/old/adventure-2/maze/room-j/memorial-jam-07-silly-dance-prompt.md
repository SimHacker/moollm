## Prompt

PURE CHAOS AND JOY! Captain Ashford mid-dance move, one leg kicked high, arms thrown wide, head thrown back in laughter. His Nomi cape swirls around him like a living thing, star-chart lining flashing.

His blue-glowing lamp swings wildly from one hand, casting crazy shadows that dance across the walls. The Sweetness That Remains floats beside him, PULSING IN RHYTHM with some unheard music.

The vending machine's display scrolls: `🎵 🎶 🎵 💃 🕺 🎵 🎶 🎵`

This is not dignified. This is not proper Belter behavior. This is a man who has eaten memorial jam, created a magical heart artifact, and is now CELEBRATING LIFE.

Motion blur on the cape. Joy blur on the face.

**Style:** Dance photography meets fever dream. Klaus Nomi meets Gene Kelly meets absolute ridiculous joy.

**Mood:** "THE SKELETON WOULD HAVE LOVED THIS. I AM DANCING FOR THEM. I AM DANCING FOR THE MACHINE. I AM DANCING FOR GRANDMOTHER. I AM JUST DANCING."

## Technical Notes

- Aspect ratio: 1:1 (square, dynamic)
- Focus: Intentional motion blur on cape and limbs, sharp on face
- Lighting: CHAOTIC — blue lamp swinging, pink heart pulsing, machine strobing
- Color palette: EVERYTHING — blue, pink, black cape, star-chart sparkles
- Composition: Center frame, maximum energy, feeling of spinning
