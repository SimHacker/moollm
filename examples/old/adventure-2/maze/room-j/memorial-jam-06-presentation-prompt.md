## Prompt

Captain Ashford in a deep, formal bow before the ACME Lamp Refueling machine. He holds the Sweetness That Remains out toward the machine in both hands, presenting it like a knight offering a sacred relic to royalty.

The vending machine's lights flicker in a cascade — it's MOVED by this gesture. Its display shows multiple heart emojis: `❤️❤️❤️`

Ashford's cape spreads dramatically behind him in the bow. His face is turned downward in genuine respect. This machine waited alone for years. Now it has a friend.

The pink heart hovers slightly above his palms, as if eager to meet its new companion.

**Style:** Courtly ceremony meets absurdist theater. Treating a vending machine with the respect usually reserved for emperors.

**Mood:** "You have served adventurers faithfully. You tried to save the skeleton. You deserve this offering."
