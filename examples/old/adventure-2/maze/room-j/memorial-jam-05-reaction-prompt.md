## Prompt

Captain Ashford stands before the vending machine, cradling the Sweetness That Remains in both hands. Tears stream freely down his jam-stained cheeks. He's not trying to hide them. This is CATHARSIS.

The crystalline heart glows pink in his palms, warm and alive. Behind him, the vending machine's display shows a large `❤️` emoji — the machine is MOVED.

His expression is overwhelming emotion — grief for the skeleton who never made it, joy at creating something beautiful, gratitude for grandmother's jam, relief that the ceremony is complete.

The blue lamp casts his shadow long against the cave wall. He looks like a prophet holding a sacred relic.

**Style:** Emotional portrait meets religious iconography. The raw vulnerability of a man transformed by jam.

**Mood:** "I am crying. The machine is crying (in its way). We are all crying. And it's BEAUTIFUL."
