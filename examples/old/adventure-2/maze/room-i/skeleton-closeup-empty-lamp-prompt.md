> *"Room F took their light, their hope, their way, And left them stumbling, blind, to stay."*
> — Ode to the Lost Explorer

### The Story
This lamp is nearly identical to the player's — same brass construction, same wick mechanism. But this one is DARK. The oil ran out in Room F (the cold room). The cold drains oil twice as fast. They didn't know. They didn't prepare.

## Prompt

Close-up of a brass oil lamp lying on stone floor beside skeletal remains. The lamp is beautifully crafted — this was an adventurer of means — but utterly dark. The glass is cold, slightly fogged from years of disuse. The brass has tarnished to a mournful green patina.

The wick is visible: completely dry, burnt black at the tip where it gave its last light. The oil reservoir is visibly EMPTY, just a dark residue coating the inside.

Dust has settled on everything. A single cobweb connects the lamp to the skeleton's fingers, as if they reached for it in the end.

In the background, barely visible, the warm glow of the PLAYER'S lamp creates a halo effect — light where this lamp has none.

**Style:** Still life meets memento mori. The lamp as symbol of hope extinguished.

**Mood:** "So close to the vendor. So close to a refill. So close to survival."
