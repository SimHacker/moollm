  # THE SCENE
  
  scene: |
    Captain Ashford enters Room I carrying the grue's severed head.
    The blue lamp burns steadily. The Gorgonzola Glaive, still
    dripping with void-ichor, hangs at his side.
    
    The skeleton grins its eternal grin.
    The Memorial Pie bubbles softly.
    The machine's letter rests in the skeleton's left hand.
    The ode rests on the skeleton's chest.
    
    And now, at the skeleton's feet, the trophy is placed.
    
  placement: |
    The grue's head is set down gently, directly in front of the
    skeleton's worn boots. Its many closed eyes face upward, as if
    looking at the adventurer it failed to consume forty years ago.
    
    The teeth, still sharp, glint in the blue lamplight.
    
    It is proof. It is closure. It is VENGEANCE.
    
  # CAPTAIN ASHFORD'S WORDS
  
  spoken_words: |
    "Here. This is the thing that killed you.
    
    This is the darkness that has haunted this maze for forty years.
    This is what I promised you.
    
    It will never hurt anyone again.
    
    You can rest now.
    
    The vow is fulfilled."

  # REACTIONS
  
  skeleton_reaction: |
    The skeleton does nothing. Of course — they're a skeleton.
    
    But somehow, in the stillness that follows, something SHIFTS.
    
    The pointing finger, forever aimed west toward the vendor,
    seems to relax — just slightly. As if they no longer need
    to warn travelers of the danger.
    
    The grin, eternal and knowing, seems peaceful now rather
    than smug. Not "I know something you don't" but rather
    "I am content."
    
    They have been AVENGED.
    
  memorial_pie_reaction: |
    The Memorial Pie bubbles with what might be approval.
    Its savory aroma intensifies briefly — a salute to the
    fallen, now honored.
    
  machine_reaction: |
    Two rooms away, ACME Unit #47's display changes:
    
    "GRUE SIGNAL... TERMINATED."
    
    Then: "FORTY YEARS OF VIGILANCE... ENDED."
    
    Then: "THANK YOU, CAPTAIN."
    
    Then: "...my friend can rest now..."
    
    The Sweetness That Remains pulses warmly beside it.

  # LEGACY
  
  legacy: |
    The skeleton is no longer just a warning.
    They are a MEMORIAL to someone who was avenged.
    
    Future adventurers who find this room will see:
    - A skeleton at peace
    - An ode to their memory
    - A letter from a friend
    - The head of their killer at their feet
    
    And they will know: someone cared. Someone remembered.
    Someone ACTED.
    
    The darkness is not invincible.
    The prey can fight back.
    The dead can be honored.
