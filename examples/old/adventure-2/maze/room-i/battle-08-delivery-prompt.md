## Prompt

A SOLEMN MEMORIAL SCENE in the Skeleton's Chamber.

**THE COMPOSITION:**
- Chiaroscuro lighting: stark contrast between blue lamplight and deep shadows
- Three key elements arranged in a sacred triangle:
  - The skeleton (top)
  - Captain Ashford (left, kneeling)
  - The grue's head (bottom center, just placed)

**THE SKELETON:**
- Leaning against the wall, peaceful
- Eternal grin now soft, content
- Pointing finger slightly relaxed (no longer urgent)
- In left hand: the machine's letter (paper visible)
- On chest: the ode (paper visible)
- NEW: At feet: the grue's severed head

**CAPTAIN ASHFORD:**
- Kneeling, having just placed the trophy
- One hand still touching the head (placing it)
- Face solemn, respectful, fulfilled
- Blue lamp beside him, casting the light
- Gorgonzola Glaive at his side, cleaned of ichor
- Nomi cape pooled around him

**THE GRUE'S HEAD:**
- Placed reverently at the skeleton's feet
- Many dark eyes facing upward
- A trophy, a proof, a closure
- The thing that killed them, now killed in turn

**THE MEMORIAL PIE:**
- Visible in the background
- Bubbling softly
- Bearing witness

**Style:** Rembrandt-style chiaroscuro. A scene of sacred closure. The violence is over; this is the AFTERMATH, the MEANING, the PEACE.

**Mood:** "This is what vengeance looks like when it's complete. Not rage — REST."
