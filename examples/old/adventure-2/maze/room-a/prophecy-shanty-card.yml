  lyrics: |
    === VERSE 1: THE APPLE ===
    
    Oye, I found an apple, red as blood and twice as sweet,
    Suspiciously perfect, yeah, too good for me to beat!
    I dropped it as a marker, like a proper maze-wise fool,
    But then I thought "why waste it?" — that's my mama's golden rule!
    
    === CHORUS ===
    
    Heave away, beltalowda, through the dark we go!
    Drop the food to mark the path, let the grues all know!
    Eating ain't no wasting if it shows you where to roam—
    Every bite's a beacon, every crumb will lead you home!
    
    === VERSE 2: THE VISION ===
    
    I bit into that apple and the world went black as space,
    But then I saw the maze, yeah, every passage, every place!
    The gold is in the cold room, the vendor's in the deep,
    The skeleton tried running when their lamp ran out of heat!
    
    === CHORUS (variation) ===
    
    Heave away, beltalowda, through the dark we go!
    The apple showed me everything, now the whole maze I know!
    West to D and north to END — the treasure's waiting there!
    Or hunt for gold and lamp oil if I've courage left to spare!
    
    === VERSE 3: THE PROMISE ===
    
    My mama said "don't waste it!" and I heard her loud and clear,
    But eating marks the room just fine — the oracle's still HERE!
    The core glows in the puddle and it whispers as I pass:
    "You didn't waste us, Captain — you just processed us REAL FAST!"
    
    === CHORUS (justification) ===
    
    Heave away, beltalowda, through the dark we go!
    The Fantastipants Express runs hot, but still I'm not no schmo!
    The food ends up as markers, just... transformed along the way,
    And Mama can't be angry 'cause I'M STILL MAPPING, OKAY?!
    
    === VERSE 4: THE JUSTIFICATION ===
    
    Some say I'm making excuses, some say I'm playing loose,
    But every eaten morsel has produced a marking DEUCE!
    The cake achieved transcendence! The apple showed the map!
    If that's what "wasting food" means, then I'll TAKE that wasted RAP!
    
    === FINAL CHORUS ===
    
    Heave away, beltalowda, through the dark we STRIDE!
    With a belly full of wisdom and a mama full of PRIDE!
    ...okay maybe not pride exactly, more like "disappointed but impressed"...
    But at least I know the maze now, and my markers are THE BEST!
    
    === OUTRO (spoken) ===
    
    "...inyalowda call it wasting...
    ...beltalowda call it WISDOM EXTRACTION...
    ...the Fantastipants Express calls it TUESDAY..."

  legacy: |
    The second composition of Captain Ashford's adventure career.
    While "The Fantastipants Victory Ballad" celebrated acquiring the lamp,
    "The Prophecy Shanty" celebrates the creative interpretation of
    maternal dietary instructions.
    
    Both songs share a common theme: finding joy and meaning in
    ridiculous circumstances, and singing about it.
