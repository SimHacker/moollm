    You emerge from the stairway into warm sunlight.
    
    This is HOME — the Fantastipants family dwelling in Wobblebrook-upon-Squiggle.
    The kitchen is warm, filled with the comforting aroma of something baking.
    The table is set. A note waits.
    
    Somewhere, Mother is humming. She doesn't know you're here yet.
    
    When you're ready to END YOUR ADVENTURE, come here and greet her.
    Show her what you've accomplished. Keep your promises.
    
    ...or don't. Adventures are about choices.

  objects: []
    # Mother appears when you arrive — she's in the other room
    # The kitchen has pie on the counter (always fresh)
    # The dishes... they're in the sink. They've been waiting.

        The stairway back down to the Chamber of Commencement.
        Back to adventure. Back to darkness. Back to grues.
        
        Are you sure you want to leave home?
      
  ambience: |
    The gentle hum of domesticity. The ticking of a grandfather clock.
    The distant sound of a neighbor's dog barking. The overwhelming
    sense of peace and belonging. And pie. Definitely pie.

        Mother beams. "You did it! You ACTUALLY did it! Come here,
        let me look at you. Oh, what wonderful treasures! What
        adventures you must have had!"
        
      some_promises_kept: |
        Mother nods approvingly. "You made it home. That's what matters
        most. The rest... well, there's always next adventure."
        
      no_promises_kept: |
        Mother sighs. "You're alive. That's something. The dishes
        still need doing, you know."
