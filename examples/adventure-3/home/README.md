**Wobblebrook-upon-Squiggle** — where Mother waits.

## 🏠 Coming Home

When you're ready to END your adventure, come here.

Mother will check:
- Did you find the treasure?
- Did you bring gold?
- Did you keep your lamp lit?
- Did you survive without dying?
- **Did you keep your promises?**

| **Mother** | Waiting, probably humming |
| **Apple Pie** | Always fresh |
| **The Dishes** | Still waiting... |
| **Warm Light** | Safety at last |

## Victory Conditions

## Mother's Reactions

| Promises Kept | Response |
|---------------|----------|
| **All** | Beaming pride, celebration |
| **Some** | Approving nod, "there's always next time" |
| **None** | Sigh, "at least you're alive" |

## The Dishes

They've been waiting for three weeks.

Promise #8 from adventure-2 was "Do the dishes when I get back."

Your promises become your legacy.
