    Dearest Bumblewick,
    
    If you're reading this, you've woken up in the dungeon again.
    I'm not surprised — it's in our blood. Your grandmother was an
    adventurer. Your father still has his old lamp. And me? Well.
    There are stories I haven't told you yet.
    
    I've stocked the refrigerator. The food is for DROPPING IN THE
    MAZE to mark your path. (Though I know you'll eat some. I would
    have too. The apple is particularly good.)
    
    Don't forget your lamp. Don't get eaten by a grue. 
    Wear clean underwear.
    
    And Bumblewick — I know you'll visit the coat room. I put your
    grandmother's cape in there. The one with the stars. Whatever
    costume you choose today, whoever you decide to be, whatever
    name and pronouns feel right in your heart — you are my child, 
    and I love you completely and unconditionally. The world may 
    not always understand, but I do.
    
    You know what you're doing. Trust yourself.
    
    Write back when you can. The dungeon post still works — just
    drop letters in any mailbox you find. Tell me about your
    adventures. Send me recipes if you invent any. Pictures if you
    take them. Gold if you find too much to carry. (Ha!)
    
    Come home when you're ready. I'll have pie.
    
    Your loving Mother,
    Petunia Fantastipants
    
    P.S. - There's a skeleton in the maze who never made it home.
    His family never knew what happened. If you find him... maybe
    you could write to them? The dungeon post delivers everywhere.
    
    P.P.S. - The dishes. I haven't forgotten. Neither should you.

  # PROMISE EXTRACTION — How letters become goals
  # ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  
  promise_system:
    extraction: |
      DM reads letter and extracts promises:
      - Explicit: "I promise to..." / "I will..." / "I swear..."
      - Implicit: "I'm going to..." / "I want to..."
      - Negative: "I won't..." / "I refuse to..."
      
      Each becomes a tracked GOAL in Tom's quest log.
      
    outcomes:
      KEPT: "Mother's pride, score bonuses, emotional reward"
      BROKEN: "CURSE-OF-BROKEN-WORD risk, Mother's disappointment"
      EXCEEDED: "Extra rewards, epic stories"
      FORGOTTEN: "Mother remembers. Mother always remembers."
