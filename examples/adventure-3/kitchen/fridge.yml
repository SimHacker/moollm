# 🧊 THE REFRIGERATOR
# A cornucopia of maze-mapping provisions — RESTOCKED!

object:
  name: Fantastipants Family Refrigerator
  type: container
  
  description: |
    A magnificent refrigerator of the old-fashioned sort, with rounded
    corners and a satisfying CHUNK when you open the door. A magnet
    on the front reads "WORLD'S OKAYEST ADVENTURER".
    
    It is STUFFED with food. An improbable amount of food. The kind of
    food supply that suggests someone knows you're about to enter a maze
    and need things to drop.
    
    (The fridge has been restocked since the last adventurer's visit.)
  
  examine: |
    You open the refrigerator. A gentle light illuminates a treasure
    trove of edibles, each one distinct enough to mark a different
    room in a maze. How convenient!
  
  # The fridge is open by default (for easy access)

  # Mother's Warning
  mothers_warning: |
    A note in Mother's handwriting is stuck to the inside of the door:
    
    "Dear Adventurer,
    
    This food is for DROPPING, not EATING!
    The previous visitor... well, let's just say we don't talk
    about what happened with the blue cheese.
    
    DROP the food to MAP the maze. Do NOT eat the food.
    
    I mean it.
    
    Love, Someone's Mother
    
    P.S. The grue has respawned. Be careful."
  
  # Helpful hint
  hint: |
    PRO TIP: Take all this food and DROP items in maze rooms to mark
    where you've been. This is the classic adventure game technique
    for mapping "twisty little passages, all alike."
    
    20 items = 20 rooms you can uniquely mark. You have 10 maze rooms.
    Math is on your side!
    
    WARNING: Do NOT eat the food. Mother warned you.
    
    BUT ALSO: Previous adventurers discovered that EATING food
    creates TRANSFORMED MARKERS that are even MORE distinctive.
    Your call. Mother probably won't find out.

eat_mechanic:
  trigger: "EAT [food_item]"
  
  effect: |
    1. Food is removed from inventory
    2. Something HILARIOUS happens (DM: be creative!)
    3. Food appears on room floor (possibly transformed)
    4. Food can add properties to the adventurer
    5. Food still works as a maze marker (maybe better now!)
    
  improvisation_patterns:
    physical: "Food changes form (solid→liquid, whole→scattered, etc.)"
    temporal: "Time passes differently (ages, de-ages, time-shifts)"
    emotional: "Food gains feelings or affects player's emotions"
    sentient: "Food becomes alive (create a .yml file for it!)"
    absorptive: "Player absorbs something from the food permanently"
    followers: "Food spawns entities that follow the player"
    
  persistence:
    update_player: "Add properties to player.yml"
    update_room: "Add transformed food to ROOM.yml contents"
    create_files: "Sentient foods need their own .yml files!"
