  # META
  
  adventure: 3
  forked_from: adventure-2
  
  lineage: |
    This world was shaped by Bumblewick Fantastipants (adventure-2),
    who became Captain Ashford, slew a grue with blue cheese, and
    went home to matching Nomi capes with Mother.
    
    The grue has respawned. The food is restocked. The lamp is full.
    But the world remembers. Maurice remembers. The skeleton waits.
