## 🎯 Your Goals

From Mother's note on the kitchen table:

1. **Find treasure** (+10 points)
2. **Bring gold home** (Mother's approval)
3. **Return home safely** (Adventure complete!)

*Plus eight promises to keep... but you'll find those yourself.*

3. **Visit the Coatroom** — Maurice can help you discover who you want to be.
4. **Raid the Fridge** — 20 food items for maze mapping.

6. **The Vending Machine** — Room J sells Premium Glow Juice (3 gold).
7. **The Skeleton Points West** — Follow its guidance.
8. **There's 100 Gold** — In the grue's lair. If you dare.
