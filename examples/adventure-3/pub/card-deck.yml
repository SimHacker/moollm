    A well-worn deck of cards sits on the bar, edges softened by
    countless shuffles. The backs feature a design of crossed
    swords over a tankard — the Rusty Lantern's own deck.
    
    These cards have seen fortunes won and lost, secrets revealed,
    and at least one duel triggered.
    
  examine: |
    52 cards plus two jokers. All present and accounted for.
    Some cards are slightly more worn than others — the aces,
    the face cards, and mysteriously, the seven of clubs.
    
    (Why the seven of clubs? Ask around. Someone knows.)

        House game. Each player draws cards trying to reach
        exactly 21 without going over. But FACE CARDS are
        "encounters" — you must tell a story of defeating
        that encounter or lose your stake.
      stakes: "2 gold buy-in"
      social: "Great for icebreaking"
      
  mechanics: |
    Can win or lose gold

    Can cheat (if skilled and brave)

    You'll get three different stories. One of them is true.
