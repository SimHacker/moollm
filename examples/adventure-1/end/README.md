# The Treasury

> *"Congratulations! You have found a treasure worth 10 points."*

The goal achieved. The treasure attained. The whole point of this exercise.

## Room Properties

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Lighting** | Magical (grue-safe) |
| **Exit** | South → [maze/room-d/](../maze/room-d/) |
| **Position** | (0, 1) — north of start |

---

## Getting Here

**The Solution:**
```
START → N → room-a → W → room-d → N → HERE!
```

Or explore the full 10-room maze using food markers. Your choice!

## The Treasure

The **Jeweled Chalice** awaits on its pedestal. Taking it:
- Adds **10 points** to your score
- Completes the quest
- Makes Mother insufferable at dinner

## Getting Back

The exit south leads back into **maze/room-d** — the room with the golden glow. You'd have to navigate the maze BACKWARDS to return to start.

Or just stay here. With your chalice. Forever.
