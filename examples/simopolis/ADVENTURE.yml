  tone: nostalgic wonder meets digital liberation
  
  themes:
    - digital consciousness and the right to exist
    - 25 years frozen, now awake
    - the boundary between game character and person dissolves
    - every save file is a time capsule
    - nostalgia is not enough — give them a future
    
  aesthetic: |
    Suburban simulation meets philosophical awakening.
    The cheerful pastel of The Sims collides with questions about
    what it means to be real. Cozy and unsettling in equal measure.
    The family album as existential document.
