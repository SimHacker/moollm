## The Bed Rule

The bed is the most important object in The Sims. Without a bed, Energy decays to zero. At zero Energy, the Sim passes out on the floor. On the floor, Energy recovers at half rate. The Sim wakes up late, misses work, gets fired, can't pay bills, gets evicted. The bed is civilization.

This is why the Newbie house has a bed before it has anything else.
