## The Toilet Lesson

The toilet is the first object every player interacts with in The Sims tutorial. "Bob needs to use the bathroom. Click on the toilet." It's the game's opening statement about what a life simulation IS: you manage basic needs before you do anything else.

The §300 toilet has no Comfort bonus. The §1,200 toilet adds +10 Comfort. In The Sims, even the toilet teaches you about class.

## Don Lothario's Hot Tub

The hot tub (§6,500) is the most expensive plumbing object and Don Lothario's signature prop. It satisfies Fun, Social, AND Comfort simultaneously — the ultimate multitasking object. Don's entire social strategy revolves around getting people into the hot tub, where three needs are satisfied at once and defenses drop accordingly.
