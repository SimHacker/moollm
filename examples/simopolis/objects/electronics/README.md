## The TV Problem

The cheap TV (§85) is the most efficient Fun-per-Simoleon object in the game. Bob Newbie's relationship with the TV is legendary: players set him in front of it to boost Fun and he never moves. The TV is The Sims' first attention trap — designed to be efficient enough to use but boring enough to be upgraded from.

The expensive TV costs §3,500 but adds Comfort. Money doesn't just buy better stats in The Sims — it buys multitasking.
