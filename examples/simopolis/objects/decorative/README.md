# Decorative

Art, plants, rugs, and lighting. The objects that satisfy the Room need.

## How Room Score Works

The Room need is unique in The Sims: it's not satisfied by a specific action (like eating satisfies Hunger). Room score is ambient — it's calculated from the quality and quantity of decorative objects visible in the current room. More decorations = higher Room score = happier Sim.

## Key Objects

| Object | Room Score | Price | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|-------|
| Cheap Painting | +1 | §45 | The staple. Every wall gets one. |
| Expensive Painting | +5 | §7,500 | Statement piece. Goth Manor has three. |
| Floor Lamp | +1 | §25 | Also functional: prevents darkness penalty. |
| Table Lamp | +1 | §85 | Better light, better mood. |
| Potted Plant | +2 | §30 | Nature. Indoors. |
| Rug | +1 | §15-500 | Floor coverage. Aesthetic upgrade. |
| Statue | +3 | §1,200 | Art as furniture. |
| Fountain | +5 | §4,000 | The ultimate Room score object. |

## The Darkness Penalty

Rooms without lighting have a negative Room score modifier. Sims in dark rooms get sadder. The cheapest floor lamp (§25) prevents this entirely. Lighting is the most cost-effective Room improvement in the game.

## Goth Manor vs. Newbie House

Goth Manor's Room score is off the charts: expensive paintings, full lighting, quality furniture, a fountain, landscaping. The Newbie house has bare walls and a floor lamp. The difference in resident mood is measurable and persistent. Money buys happiness in The Sims. Specifically, money buys Room score.
