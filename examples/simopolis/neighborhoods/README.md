# Simopolis Neighborhoods

Simopolis is organized into neighborhoods — distinct areas where families live, each with its own character and stories. This mirrors The Sims 1's neighborhood system, where up to 10 houses occupied lots arranged around streets and landmarks.

## Neighborhoods

### Newbie Heights
**`newbie/`** — The tutorial neighborhood. Where every Sims player started. Bob and Betty Newbie's humble starter home sits on a modest lot. The lawns are a little bare, the furniture is from the cheapest catalog page, and the kitchen is a fire hazard. But it's home.

### Gothique Estates  
**`goth/`** — The mansion on the hill. The Goth family estate dominates the skyline. Victorian architecture, wrought-iron fences, a swimming pool, a telescope pointed at the stars. Mortimer broods. Bella vanished. Cassandra watches from the window. The gravestones in the backyard tell older stories.

### Pleasant Valley
**`pleasant/`** — Suburban drama central. Picket fences and simmering tensions. Where Don Lothario charms his way through the neighborhood. The houses are nicer than Newbie Heights but the relationships are messier.

### Custom District
**`custom/`** — User-created neighborhoods. Import your own save files, build your own lots, place your own families. The frontier of Simopolis, where anything goes.

## Neighborhood Structure

Each neighborhood is a directory containing:

```
neighborhood/
├── README.md          # Description, map, resident list
├── ROOM.yml           # MOOLLM room definition (walkable space)
└── lots/              # Individual house lots (optional)
```
