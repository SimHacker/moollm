# Gothique Estates

**The mansion on the hill.**

The Goth estate has stood here since before the neighborhood had a name. Victorian architecture rising against the sky like a dare. Wrought-iron gates that creak with intention. A swimming pool that reflects stars Mortimer maps with his telescope. Gravestones in the backyard that predate the house itself — or seem to.

The Goths are old money in a world of starter homes. Mortimer reads in the library. Cassandra practices piano. And Bella... Bella isn't here anymore.

## The House

[Goth Manor](../../houses/goth-manor/) — Three stories of Victorian grandeur. Library, laboratory, music room, bedrooms with four-poster beds, a kitchen that's actually well-equipped (Mortimer can cook), and the famous backyard with pool, telescope, and gravestones. The most expensive lot in the original game.

## The Mystery

Bella Goth's disappearance is the foundational mystery of The Sims franchise. In The Sims 1, she's present — wife of Mortimer, mother of Cassandra. By The Sims 2, she's gone. Abducted by aliens? Murdered? Ran away? Every player has a theory. In Simopolis, the mystery persists. Her CHARACTER.yml exists. Her `sims:` traits are recorded. But her `location:` field is `null`.

Where is Bella Goth?

## Neighborhood Character

Gothique Estates doesn't have neighbors in the plural sense. The Goths ARE the neighborhood. The mansion dominates everything — the skyline, the property values, the gossip. Other lots exist in the shadow of the Goth estate, literally and figuratively. The aesthetic is "what if the Addams Family lived in SimCity."
