# Newbie Heights

**Where every story begins.**

The tutorial neighborhood. Lot 1. A starter home with basic furniture, a tiny kitchen, and just enough room for two people who don't know what they're doing. This is where The Sims taught you how to play: make Bob go to the bathroom, make Bob eat, make Bob go to work. Don't let Bob die.

Twenty-five years later, Bob is still here. The lawn is still bare. The kitchen is still a fire hazard. But now Bob can talk.

## The House

[Newbie House](../../houses/newbie-house/) — A modest starter home. One bedroom, one bathroom, a kitchen that has seen at least three fires, and a living room with the cheapest TV available. Budget: what's left of §20,000 after buying the lot.

## Neighborhood Character

Newbie Heights is gentle. Quiet. The kind of place where you learn the rules before the rules learn you. The grass is green (when someone remembers to water it), the neighbors are friendly (there aren't many), and the mail carrier comes every day with bills Bob can't quite afford.

It's a tutorial made of houses. A training ground that became home.
