# Pleasant Valley

**Suburban drama behind picket fences.**

The "nice" neighborhood where everything looks perfect from the sidewalk. Mowed lawns, matching mailboxes, potluck dinners on weekends. Underneath: romantic entanglements, career rivalries, and Don Lothario working his way through every household with a welcome mat.

Pleasant Valley is where The Sims stops being a tutorial and starts being a soap opera.

## Neighborhood Character

Pleasant Valley is aspirational suburbia — the kind of place that looks great in a real estate listing and dissolves into chaos the moment you move in. Every house has a story. Every story has a twist. Every twist involves someone's significant other in someone else's hot tub.

This is where the social simulation shines. Relationships, jealousy, career competition, neighborhood gossip. The Sims at its most human.

## Future Imports

Pleasant Valley is the staging ground for additional Sims 1 and Sims 2 families. As more saves are uplifted, this neighborhood grows. The Pleasants, the Burbs, the Dreamers — they all belong here.
