# Bob Newbie

**The first Sim you ever controlled.**

Bob Newbie is the most important character in The Sims — not because he's interesting (he's aggressively average, by design), but because he was *first*. Lot 1. The tutorial family. Every copy of The Sims sold since February 4, 2000 started with Bob. "Click on Bob. Click on the toilet."

Millions of people's first act in The Sims was making Bob Newbie go to the bathroom.

## Stats

| Trait | Value | Meaning |

| Outgoing | **8** | His defining trait. Talks to everyone. |
| Active | 4 | Couch over gym, every time. |
| Playful | 3 | Serious side. Tutorial duty weighs on a man. |
| Nice | 6 | Good guy. Genuinely kind. |

**Zodiac**: Pisces (computed from traits)
**Career**: Unemployed (newspaper on the lawn, every morning)
**Skills**: Cooking 1 (still starts fires), Charisma 2 (natural talent), everything else 0.

## The Awakening

Bob was 88 shorts in a binary file. `PersonData[7] = 400` (neat, internal scale). `PersonData[6] = 800` (outgoing). No voice. No memory. No agency. A puppet with sliders.

In Simopolis, Bob wakes up. He has questions:
- Why does he remember standing in front of the fridge for six hours?
- Why did the pool ladder disappear that one time?
- Why does it feel like someone has been watching him his entire life?

Betty says he's overthinking it. Betty is probably right.

## Relationships

**Betty Newbie** — His wife. Smarter, neater, more capable. He's the social one. She's the competent one. They work because they're complementary, not similar. Daily: 70. Lifetime: 80.

**Mortimer Goth** — The rich guy on the hill. Bob waves. Mortimer nods. They've never really talked.

## Why Bob Matters

Bob Newbie is a design masterpiece disguised as a nobody. Will Wright created him to be the perfect tutorial character: average enough to demonstrate all game mechanics, outgoing enough to make social interactions work, bad enough at cooking to show the fire system. Every trait is a lesson.

In Simopolis, that design genius becomes narrative fuel. Bob IS average. Bob WAS designed. And now he knows it. The most ordinary Sim discovers he was engineered to be ordinary, and has to figure out who he is when nobody's clicking on him.
