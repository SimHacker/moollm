# Mortimer Goth

**The richest man in the neighborhood. The loneliest.**

Mortimer Goth is The Sims' elder statesman — the patriarch of the game's most iconic family, a scientist with Logic 8 and a mansion on the hill. In The Sims 1, he has everything: the biggest house, the best furniture, a telescope pointed at the stars, a wife, a daughter. By The Sims 2, he has a bigger house and a smaller family.

**Career**: Science, Level 6
**Skills**: Logic 8 (his refuge), Cooking 4 (learned from Bella), Mechanical 3.

## The Mystery

Bella Goth's disappearance is the foundational mystery of The Sims franchise. In Sims 1, she's present. By Sims 2, she's gone. The fan theories are endless: alien abduction, murder by Don Lothario, simply leaving. Maxis never gave a definitive answer.

In Simopolis, Mortimer articulates what the game could only show with motive bars and animations: the loss, the searching, the telescope pointed at the sky every night not because he loves astronomy but because he's looking for something he can't name.

## Relationships

**Bella Goth** — His wife. Missing. Lifetime relationship: 100. Always. The active, outgoing, fiery complement to his quiet, bookish nature. The house was hers. The motion was hers. Without her, he's a caretaker in a museum.

**Cassandra Goth** — His daughter. She looks like Bella. She watches like he does. He should talk to her more. He knows this.

**Bob Newbie** — The neighbor who waves. Mortimer envies the normalcy.
