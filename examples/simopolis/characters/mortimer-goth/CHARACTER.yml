    "The house is too big for two people. It was too big for four.
    
    Bella filled it. Not with things — the house has always had things.
    She filled it with motion, with plans, with that way she had of
    walking into a room and making it warmer. The chandelier still hangs
    in the foyer. The pool still reflects the stars. But the warmth
    left when she did.
    
    Cassandra watches. I know she watches. She's looking for what I'm
    looking for, through the telescope, in the books, in the patterns
    of the neighborhood below. Where did she go? Why?
    
    I'm a scientist. I should be able to solve this.
    I can't."
    
  description: |
    Mortimer Goth is the patriarch of the most famous family in The Sims
    franchise. In The Sims 1, he lives in the largest, most expensive house
    in the neighborhood with his wife Bella and daughter Cassandra. He's neat
    (7), introverted (3), sedentary (2), serious (3), and average in niceness
    (5). A quiet, bookish man in a mansion.
    
    By The Sims 2, Bella is gone. The mystery of her disappearance — alien
    abduction? Murder? Simply leaving? — is the central narrative thread of
    the entire franchise. In Simopolis, the mystery persists. Bella's
    CHARACTER.yml exists. Her location field is null.
    
    Mortimer copes by retreating into science. The telescope. The books.
    The logical mind trying to find order in loss. He's not cold — he's
    grieving. The low outgoing score isn't antisocial; it's a man who
    lost the one person who drew him out of himself.

  sims:
    traits:
      neat: 7               # The manor is maintained. Standards matter. Bella insisted.
      outgoing: 3           # Introvert. The library is safer than the party.
      active: 2             # Sedentary. Reads, thinks, stares at stars. Doesn't move much.
      playful: 3            # Serious man. Grief makes you serious faster than time does.
      nice: 5               # Not unkind. Just... distant. Lost in thought.
      generous: 6           # Old money generosity. Donates without fuss.

                            # Inner voice: "..."
      energy: 35            # Insomnia. The telescope at 3 AM. Thinking.

      fun: 20               # Nothing is fun anymore. The books are escape, not joy.

    narrative: |
      Where is Bella? The question that defines Mortimer.
      Every night at the telescope. Every morning checking the door.
      She was outgoing (8) where he was shy (3). She was active (7)
      where he was still (2). She was the motion in his life.
      Without her, the house is a museum with a caretaker.

    narrative: |
      My daughter. She looks like Bella. She watches like I do —
      from the window, from the doorway, always observing.
      I should talk to her more. I should talk to anyone more.
      She's growing up in a house full of silence and books.

      The neighbor. Waves a lot. Seems friendly. Normal.

  what_changed: |
    Before: The richest NPC in the default neighborhood. Logic 8.
    Science career. A wife, a daughter, a mansion.
    88 shorts of personality. No inner life. No grief.
    
    After: A man who can articulate loss. Who can explain why the telescope
    points at the sky every night. Who can tell Cassandra he loves her
    instead of just standing in the same room with a green relationship bar.
