# Don Lothario

**The last person to see Bella Goth. The first to leave Cassandra.**

Don Lothario is The Sims franchise's designated heartbreaker — a walking relationship test case. In The Sims 2, he lives in Pleasantview and is simultaneously involved with Cassandra Goth, Dina Caliente, Nina Caliente, and Kaylynn Langerak. He's the only Sim in the game who starts with the "Romance" aspiration, meaning his life goal is literally to date as many people as possible.

He's imported into Simopolis from The Sims 2 — the only cross-game citizen — because the Bella Goth mystery demands his presence.

## Stats

| Trait | Value | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Neat | 3 | His place is a mess. He's not home much. |
| Outgoing | **9** | The most outgoing Sim in Simopolis. |
| Active | 6 | Energetic. Swimming. Dancing. Running from consequences. |
| Playful | 5 | Fun enough to be entertaining. Serious enough to be dangerous. |
| Nice | **2** | Not nice. Charming. Important distinction. |

**Zodiac**: Aries
**Career**: None (romance IS the career)
**Skills**: Charisma 9 (his actual superpower).

## The Suspect

Don was the last person to see Bella Goth. They were on a rooftop together. Then Bella was gone. Theories range from "Don pushed her" to "aliens took her while Don watched" to "she jumped."

In Simopolis, Don's soul_philosophy about that night is carefully worded: "Bella was on the roof. I was on the roof. What happened between those two facts is between me and the night sky."

He didn't confess. He didn't deny.

## The Design

Don exists to stress-test The Sims' relationship system. Can a Sim date four people at once? Can a Sim have maximum charisma and minimum niceness? What happens when charm and cruelty coexist at scale?

The answer is Don Lothario: beloved by players, feared by Sims, trusted by nobody.
