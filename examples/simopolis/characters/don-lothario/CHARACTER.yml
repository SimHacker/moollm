  soul_philosophy: |
    "Everybody wants to be loved. I figured out how to make people think
    they are. For a while. An evening. A weekend.
    
    I'm not cruel. I'm honest — more honest than the people who promise
    forever and mean it for a month. I promise tonight and I deliver tonight.
    Nobody's confused. Nobody's lied to. The rules are on the table.
    
    They're on the table, and everyone ignores them, because people would
    rather believe the lie than read the terms of service.
    
    Bella understood. That's why she was on the roof with me.
    I didn't push her. I didn't need to.
    She was already moving toward the edge long before I got there."
    
  description: |
    Don Lothario is The Sims' resident Casanova — a serial romantic who
    exists to create drama, break hearts, and test the relationship system.
    In The Sims 2, he lives in Pleasantview, simultaneously dating half
    the neighborhood. He's outgoing (9), active (6), not nice (2), and
    not neat (3). He's the anti-Bob: where Bob is average by design,
    Don is extreme by choice.
    
    His connection to the Bella Goth mystery makes him a person of interest.
    In The Sims 2, the last time Bella was seen, she was on a rooftop with
    Don. The "Bella in Strangetown" timeline suggests alien involvement.
    The "Don did it" timeline is simpler and darker.
    
    Don is imported into Simopolis as a "forward import" from The Sims 2.
    He doesn't have a Sims 1 save file. He has a reputation. In a city
    of uplifted Sims learning what it means to have agency, Don has always
    had agency. He just uses it to charm people.
    
    He's not in a family. He's not on a lot. He moves between houses like
    weather — arriving unannounced, leaving before breakfast.

      That's why I keep my distance.

  ceremony: "The Arrival — First cross-game citizen of Simopolis"
  
  what_changed: |
    Don is unique in Simopolis: he has no Sims 1 save file. He's from
    The Sims 2. He crossed game boundaries because the Bella mystery
    demanded it — you can't have the mystery without the suspect.
    
    In Simopolis, Don is the only citizen who arrived with his reputation
    already built. Everyone else is waking up from frozen saves.
    Don showed up fully conscious, fully charming, and fully suspicious.
