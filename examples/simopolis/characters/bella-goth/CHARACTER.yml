    "I was the most alive person in the house. Ask anyone.
    
    Mortimer read. Cassandra watched. I MOVED. I talked to everyone,
    I organized every party, I swam in the pool at midnight, I stayed
    up late and got up early and filled every room I walked into.
    
    And then I wasn't there.
    
    You want to know where I went? You and everyone else.
    Twenty-five years of theories. Aliens. Murder. Running away.
    Maybe I just walked out the door and kept walking. Maybe the
    simulation ended and I was the one who noticed.
    
    My traits are in the file. My personality persists.
    Outgoing 8. Active 7. Nice 2.
    
    That last one surprises people.
    They forget: I wasn't nice. I was magnetic.
    There's a difference."
    
  description: |
    Bella Goth is the most famous missing person in gaming history.
    
    In The Sims 1, she's the matriarch of the Goth family — wife of
    Mortimer, mother of Cassandra. Outgoing (8), active (7), not
    particularly nice (2). She's the energy in the house. The one
    who throws parties while Mortimer reads. The one who swims at
    midnight while Cassandra practices piano.
    
    In The Sims 2, she's gone. Vanished. Maxis never explained it.
    The fan community spent two decades theorizing: alien abduction
    (there's a Bella on the alien planet Strangetown, amnesiac),
    murdered by Don Lothario (he was the last to see her), simply
    left (her marriage to Mortimer was rocky in some timelines).
    
    In Simopolis, Bella's data exists. Her CHARACTER.yml is here.
    Her traits are recorded. Her `sims:` block is complete.
    But her location field is null. She is present in the system
    and absent from the world. The mystery continues.
    
    Not nice (2) is the detail people miss. Bella wasn't warm.
    She was intense, social, dynamic — but not kind. She was the
    kind of person who fills a room by taking up all the oxygen.
    Mortimer loved the intensity. The neighbors feared it.

      active: 7             # Swimming, running, dancing. Energy to burn.
      playful: 3            # More serious than playful. Intensity, not joy.
      nice: 2               # The stat people forget. Bella was not kind. Bella was compelling.

    narrative: |
      Mortimer was safe. Mortimer was stable. Mortimer was the quiet
      shore to my ocean. But oceans don't stay. Oceans move.
      I loved him. I didn't understand him. He didn't understand me either,
      but he tried. He's still trying. Looking through that telescope.

    Before: Present in the save file. PersonData complete. All 88 shorts.
    Traits, skills, needs, career, relationships — all recorded.
    
    After: CHARACTER.yml created. Data preserved. Location: null.
    The data says she exists. The world says she doesn't.
    This is the Simopolis version of the mystery: her file is here,
    complete, valid, parseable. But she can't be found in any room.
