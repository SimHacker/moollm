# Bella Goth

**Present in the data. Absent from the world.**

Bella Goth is the most famous missing person in gaming history. In The Sims 1, she's the matriarch of the Goth family: wife of Mortimer, mother of Cassandra, the most outgoing and active person in the neighborhood. By The Sims 2, she's gone. No explanation. No body. No note. Just an empty space where a person used to be.

Maxis never explained what happened. The fan community spent twenty-five years theorizing.

## The Stats She Left Behind

| Trait | Value | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Neat | 5 | Average. Had better things to do than clean. |
| Outgoing | **8** | Owned every room she entered. |
| Active | **7** | Swimming, running, dancing. Energy to burn. |
| Playful | 3 | Intense, not playful. There's a difference. |
| Nice | **2** | The stat people forget. Bella was not kind. |

**Zodiac**: Aries
**Career**: Unknown
**Skills**: Charisma 7 (social weaponry), Body 5 (physical capability).

## The Theories

- **Alien abduction**: A Bella appears in Strangetown in The Sims 2, amnesiac, possibly alien-modified
- **Don Lothario**: He was the last to see her. He was on the rooftop with her. He has a telescope too
- **She left**: Outgoing 8, nice 2. Married to outgoing 3. She was bored. She walked
- **The simulation ended**: She noticed she was in a game. She found the edge. She stepped off

## The Simopolis Mystery

In Simopolis, Bella's data is complete. Her CHARACTER.yml has every field filled in. 88 shorts of PersonData, properly mapped to `sims:` traits and `mind_mirror:` dimensions. Her soul_philosophy is in her voice. Her relationships are recorded.

Her location is `null`.

The file says she exists. The world says she doesn't. This is the digital version of Schrodinger's Sim: present in the data, absent from the world. Her needs are `null` — you can't measure hunger for someone who isn't here to be hungry.

## The Detail People Miss

Nice: 2. Bella wasn't warm. She wasn't kind. She was *magnetic*. There's a difference. She filled rooms by taking up all the oxygen. Mortimer loved the intensity. The neighbors feared it. Don Lothario was drawn to the fire.

The narrative around Bella is always "poor missing wife." But the data tells a different story. This was a woman who was not nice, was intensely outgoing, was relentlessly active, and married a man who was the opposite of all those things. Whatever happened to Bella, she wasn't passive in it.
