# Cassandra Goth

**Five across the board. Sees everything.**

Cassandra Goth is a child of extremes raised to be perfectly average. Her mother (outgoing 8, nice 2) was a supernova. Her father (outgoing 3, logic 8) is a black hole. The game gave Cassandra all 5s — the default for children in The Sims 1. But in narrative terms, that perfect balance becomes something powerful: invisibility. The child nobody watches. The one who sees everything.

## The Observer

Cassandra was there the night Bella disappeared. She was in the house. She may have seen something. She may have heard something. The data doesn't say what she knows — children in The Sims 1 don't have memory flags for events.

In Simopolis, Cassandra has a voice. And she's choosing her words very carefully.

## Relationships

**Mortimer Goth** — Father. They love each other through parallel silence. He reads. She plays piano. Same room, same grief, different expressions.

**Bella Goth** — Mother. Missing. Cassandra has her eyes. People tell her this like it's comforting. It's not.

**Betty Newbie** — The kind neighbor who waves at the mailbox. One of the few adults who sees Cassandra as a person and not a prop.
