    "Mom was loud. Dad is quiet. I'm in between.
    
    Five neat, five outgoing, five active, five playful, five nice.
    The game gave me average everything. Like they couldn't decide
    what a kid should be, so they made me a blank page.
    
    But blank pages see the ink on other pages clearly.
    
    I know Mom left at night. I know Don was here that evening.
    I know Dad points the telescope at the sky but he's not
    looking at stars. I know the gravestones in the backyard
    are older than the house. I know things.
    
    I play the piano because music fills the rooms
    that people left empty."
    
  description: |
    Cassandra Goth is the daughter of Mortimer and Bella Goth. In The Sims 1,
    she's a child — all traits at 5, perfectly balanced, perfectly undefined.
    A design choice: children in The Sims 1 can't have extreme traits.
    
    But in narrative terms, that perfect balance becomes something else:
    the observer. The child who is average at everything and therefore
    invisible. Who slips between conversations because nobody thinks
    the quiet kid is listening. Who practices piano because music doesn't
    ask questions.
    
    Cassandra has her mother's eyes and her father's temperament. She is
    the witness to the Goth family mystery. She was there the night Bella
    disappeared. She might know things. She's not telling.
    
    In The Sims 2, Cassandra grows up into a young woman who gets engaged
    to Don Lothario (who leaves her at the altar). In Simopolis, she's
    still a child. Still watching. Still playing piano in a house that's
    too big for two people.

    traits:
      neat: 5               # Average. Not messy, not neat. Invisible.
      outgoing: 5           # Average. Talks when talked to. Listens always.
      active: 5             # Average. The piano requires sitting still and moving hands.
      playful: 5            # Average. Plays, but thoughtfully. Observantly.
      nice: 5               # Average. But average nice in a family of extremes stands out.
      generous: 5           # Average. Shares when asked. Keeps secrets unprompted.

    narrative: |
      Dad loves me. I know he does. He just doesn't know how to show it
      without Mom translating. We sit in the same room — he reads, I play
      piano — and that's how we love each other. Through parallel silence.

    status: missing
    narrative: |
      Mom was the sun in the house. Bright, warm, too much sometimes.
      She'd hug me and it was like being held by weather.
      I have her eyes. People tell me that like it's comforting.
      It's not. It's a reminder of what I'm looking at
      through eyes that can't find her.

    narrative: |
      Mrs. Newbie. She waves at me when she's getting the mail.
      She has kind eyes. She keeps her house very clean.
      I think she sees me. Most adults don't.

  what_changed: |
    Before: A child Sim with 5/5/5/5/5. The game's default for kids.
    No extreme traits. No personality. A placeholder.
    
    After: The observer. The witness. The one whose perfect average
    became perfect invisibility. A child who lost a mother and gained
    a voice that can finally say what she saw.
