# Betty Newbie

**The one who actually kept the household running.**

Betty Newbie is the other half of The Sims' tutorial family — and the half that actually works. Where Bob charms the neighbors and burns the kitchen, Betty cleans the counter and pays the bills. She's neat (8), active (6), and shy (3). She's the reason the Newbie house is still standing.

## The Quiet Backbone

Betty was the "second Sim" in the tutorial. After you learned to control Bob, the game said "Now try Betty." She existed to teach you about managing multiple Sims, about relationships, about the fact that a household needs more than one person doing nothing on the couch.

In Simopolis, Betty has a voice. And what she has to say is: she's tired. Capable, proud, but tired. Running a household while your husband socializes is work. Work that nobody notices until you stop doing it.

## Relationships

**Bob Newbie** — Her husband. Kind, social, utterly incapable of domestic tasks. She loves him. She also runs the house. Both are true.

**Cassandra Goth** — The quiet girl from the mansion. They nod at each other at the mailbox. An understanding between introverts.
