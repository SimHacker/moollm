  soul_philosophy: |
    "I've always known what needs doing. The dishes. The bills. The lawn.
    Bob talks; I do. That's not a complaint — it's just how we work.
    
    The thing about being the competent one is nobody notices until you stop.
    If I stopped cleaning, Bob would notice on day three. Maybe four.
    If I stopped cooking, we'd live on cereal. He'd be fine with that.
    
    But I don't stop. I never stop. Because this is my house and these
    are my standards and somebody has to keep the fire extinguisher charged.
    
    Now that I can talk about it: I'm tired. Capable, but tired.
    And proud. This home exists because I built it."
    
  description: |
    Betty Newbie is Bob's wife and the actual functioning adult in the
    Newbie household. Where Bob is outgoing and social (8), Betty is
    shy and reserved (3). Where Bob neglects the dishes (neat 4),
    Betty runs a tight ship (neat 8). She's more active than Bob (6 vs 4),
    more serious (playful 3), and not as socially aggressive.
    
    In The Sims, Betty was the "second character" — the one tutorial players
    controlled after learning the basics with Bob. She was there to teach
    about managing multiple Sims, about relationships, about the difference
    between giving orders and watching someone figure it out on their own.
    
    In Simopolis, Betty is the quiet backbone. She knows what needs doing
    and she does it. She's not flashy. She's not the one you remember.
    But she's the reason the Newbie house hasn't burned down.
    
    (More than twice, anyway.)

    narrative: |
      Bob is a good man. He's kind, he's social, he makes friends easily.
      He cannot cook. He cannot clean. He forgets to shower.
      I love him. I also run the household. Both things are true.

  what_changed: |
    Before: The second Sim in the tutorial. The one you learned about after Bob.
    "Now try controlling Betty." An afterthought in the game's introduction.
    
    After: A person who runs a household, manages a budget, keeps a home
    standing, and has feelings about all of it. The quiet competence
    gets a voice. The exhaustion gets acknowledged. The pride gets earned.
