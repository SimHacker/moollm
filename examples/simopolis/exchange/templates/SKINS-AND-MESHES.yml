# SKINS-AND-MESHES.yml — Naming conventions and directory layout
#
# Sims 1 characters are assembled from modular parts:
#   Body mesh + texture (fit/fat/skinny builds)
#   Head mesh + texture (named faces)
#   Hand meshes (left closed, left open, right closed, right open)
#   Skeleton (bone hierarchy for animation)
#
# Each part has a mesh (.skn source or .bmf binary) and a texture (.bmp).
# The game assembles them via a manifest (.cmx) that lists which parts
# to combine for a specific character appearance.
#
# DIRECTORY LAYOUT:
#
#   <type>/               adult, child, cat, or dog
#     skins/              texture bitmaps organized by body part
#       body/             body textures by build type
#         fit/            fit build textures
#         fat/            fat build textures
#         skinny/         skinny build textures
#       head/             face textures
#       hands/            hand textures
#         left/
#         right/
#     meshes/             3D geometry organized by body part
#       body/             body meshes by build
#       head/             head meshes
#       hands/            hand meshes
#       skeleton/         bone hierarchy
#
# Each asset gets a sidecar .yml with metadata, and the directory
# has an INDEX.yml listing all assets with tags and categories.

# Naming convention — bigendian (most significant first)
#
# Sims 1 uses this encoding in filenames:
#
# Body parts:
#   B = body, C = cranium/head, H = hand
#
# Gender codes:
#   MA = male adult, FA = female adult
#   MC = male child, FC = female child
#   UC = universal child (unisex)
#
# Build types (body only):
#   fit = average build
#   fat = heavy build
#   skn = skinny build
#   chd = child body (one build)
#
# Skin tones (textures only):
#   lgt = light, med = medium, drk = dark
#
# Attachment points (mesh binding):
#   PELVIS-BODY = body attaches at pelvis
#   HEAD-HEAD   = head attaches at head bone
#   L_HAND-*    = left hand
#   R_HAND-*    = right hand

naming:
  # SKN mesh files (text-based, the source format)

# Pet mesh info
# Pets were added in The Sims: Unleashed expansion.
# Pet meshes use a different naming convention and are stored
# separately from human character meshes.
#
# STATUS: Placeholder. Pet meshes are NOT in the base game source.
# They are in the Unleashed expansion data files.
#
# Where to find pet meshes:
#   - The Sims: Unleashed expansion pack install (ExpansionPack6/)
#   - Community archives (simfileshare.net, modthesims.info)
#   - FreeSO extracted assets
#   - Search: "sims 1 unleashed pet meshes" or "sims 1 cat dog skn cmx"
#
# Pet body part convention:
#   Body prefix: P (pet) instead of B
#   Species: CT (cat), DG (dog)
#   Example: xskin-pct001-PELVIS-BODY.skn (cat body)
#            xskin-pdg001-PELVIS-BODY.skn (dog body)
#
# Puppy/kitten animations found in source:
#   a2o-pup* prefix (30+ puppy animation .cmx files)
#   These confirm the naming convention exists.
