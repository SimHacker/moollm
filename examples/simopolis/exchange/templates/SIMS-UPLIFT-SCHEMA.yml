# SIMS-UPLIFT.yml Schema
#
# This is the machine-readable interchange format between obliterator.py
# (which reads/writes Sims 1 binary save files) and the LLM (which
# reads/writes CHARACTER.yml narrative files).
#
# UPLIFT:     obliterator.py reads binary → writes SIMS-UPLIFT.yml
#             LLM reads SIMS-UPLIFT.yml → generates CHARACTER.yml
#
# HOMECOMING: LLM reads CHARACTER.yml → writes SIMS-UPLIFT.yml
#             obliterator.py reads SIMS-UPLIFT.yml → writes binary
#
# The LLM never touches binary. obliterator.py never touches narrative.
# SIMS-UPLIFT.yml is the clean handoff point between them.
#
# Every field here has a defined type, range, and meaning.
# No YAML Jazz. No comments-as-data. Just structured data.
# The LLM adds the jazz when it generates CHARACTER.yml from this.
#
# File lives in: <character-dir>/SIMS-UPLIFT.yml
# Example:       characters/bob-newbie/SIMS-UPLIFT.yml
