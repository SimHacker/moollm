# SIMS-UPLIFT.yml — Dog Template
# Dogs were added in The Sims: Unleashed expansion pack.
# Like cats, stored as neighbors with repurposed person_data.
#
# For the LLM: when generating CHARACTER.yml from this, use dog
# personality language (loyal, energetic, friendly) rather than
# human trait names. Dogs are generally more outgoing and active
# than cats, and nice maps to obedient/loyal.

# neat     → housebroken (accidents vs trained)
# outgoing → friendly (greets everyone vs shy/anxious)
# active   → energy level (needs walks vs couch potato)
# playful  → fetch/toy drive (ball-crazy vs dignified)
# nice     → obedient/loyal (comes when called vs independent)
