# SIMS-ALBUM.yml Schema
#
# Machine-readable Sims family album format. Distinct from MOOLLM
# slideshows: these are specifically Sims 1 family albums with
# game-specific metadata, historical provenance, and full i18n.
#
# The Sims 1 generated HTML family albums from save data. Players
# added captions, stories, and screenshots, then uploaded them to
# The Sims Exchange (thesims.ea.com). Many are archived on archive.org.
#
# This format captures both the original album data and translations
# into all 20 Sims languages. No language is special — every string
# field is a dict of lang_code -> text.
#
# File lives in: albums/<family-name>/SIMS-ALBUM.yml
# Translatable to: SLIDESHOW.yml (for MOOLLM presentation)
