# SIMS-UPLIFT.yml — Cat Template
# Cats were added in The Sims: Unleashed expansion pack.
# In the save file, pets are stored as neighbors with person_data
# but most fields are repurposed. Traits map differently for animals.
#
# For the LLM: when generating CHARACTER.yml from this, use cat
# personality language (aloof, curious, affectionate) rather than
# human trait names. The numbers still represent behavioral tendencies
# but the narrative framing should be feline.

# neat     → fastidious (grooming, litter box preference)
# outgoing → social (approaches humans vs hides)
# active   → playful energy (chases toys vs sleeps)
# playful  → mischievous (knocks things off counters)
# nice     → affectionate (purring, lap-sitting vs scratching)
