# Cat mesh convention (inferred from puppy animation files a2o-pup*):
#   Pets use simplified skeletons compared to humans.
#   Body and head are likely the only mesh parts (no separate hands).
#
# Known from animation files:
#   Personality-based animations exist: pupcool*, puphyp*, pupsad*
#   This confirms pet meshes use the same CMX/SKN system as humans.
