# PORTAL.yml — The Bridge Between Worlds
# Connects Simopolis to Adventure 4 (the Gezelligheid Grotto)

portal:
  name: "The Bridge to the Grotto"
  type: inter-world-portal
  
  endpoints:
    simopolis:
      location: neighborhoods/custom/portal/
      description: |
        A doorway that wasn't there yesterday. Arched, wooden, slightly
        too tall. Through it, you can hear pub noise, adventure narration,
        and the distant sound of a wumpus snoring. A sign reads:
        "The Gezelligheid Grotto — Visitors Welcome"
      appearance: |
        The portal looks like it belongs to a different architectural
        tradition entirely. In Simopolis's suburban grid, this medieval
        archway is a glitch in the aesthetic. Cassandra noticed it first.
        
    adventure_4:
      location: ../../adventure-4/street/lane-neverending/
      description: |
        Between the buildings on Lane Neverending, a suburban doorway
        appears. White picket frame. Through it, you can see mailboxes,
        mowed lawns, and hear the distant sound of a TV on too loud.
        A sign reads: "Simopolis — All Sims Welcome"
      appearance: |
        The portal looks like someone cut a piece of suburbia and pasted
        it into a fantasy street. The adventure characters find it
        unsettling. The narrator finds it difficult to describe.

  mechanics:
    travel_time: instant               # Step through = arrive

    bidirectional: true                # Both directions
    
    on_transit:
      - "Character location updates to destination world"
      - "Character retains all personality data (sims + mind_mirror)"
      - "Needs continue to decay normally"
      - "Character marked as visitor in destination world"
      - "Return portal remains accessible"
      
    restrictions:
      - "Characters must have complete CHARACTER.yml (no null required fields)"
      - "Missing characters (location: null) cannot transit — they must be found first"
      
  narrative_context: |
    The Bridge exists because MOOLLM is one world with many rooms.
    Simopolis and Adventure 4 are neighborhoods in the same city —
    just neighborhoods with very different architectural styles.
    The portal is the point where the architectural styles meet.
    
    It's also a statement: characters are characters. A Sim with
    outgoing 8 and a mind_mirror is the same kind of entity as a
    text adventure NPC with outgoing 8 and a mind_mirror. The data
    format is the bridge. The portal is just the door.
