# The Goth Family Album

**Someone is missing from every picture after page three.**

This is the Goth family album. It starts with four people in a beautiful house: Mortimer, Bella, little Cassandra, and baby Alexander (in some timelines). The photos are warm. The rooms are full. Bella is in every shot — the center of gravity, the brightest thing in the frame.

Then she isn't.

The album continues after page three, but the composition changes. The photos are the same rooms, the same furniture, the same lighting. But the framing is different. Mortimer stands where two people used to stand. Cassandra plays piano in an empty room. The pool reflects no one swimming at midnight.

## Pages

### Chapter 1: The Manor
The Goth estate in its glory. Every room documented. The foyer with the chandelier. The library with floor-to-ceiling books. Bella's garden. The pool at twilight. A house that costs more than most people's lives, filled with people who have everything except peace.

### Chapter 2: The Family
Mortimer and Bella's early days. He with his telescope, she with her parties. Opposites who work: his stillness anchors her motion, her energy brightens his solitude. Cassandra between them, quiet, watching, absorbing both frequencies.

### Chapter 3: The Night
The last photo with Bella. The composition is wrong — she's at the edge of the frame, half-turned toward something outside the shot. The backyard. The pool. The night. This is the last page where the family is complete.

### Chapter 4: After
Mortimer in the library, alone. Cassandra at the piano, alone. The guest room, untouched. The pool, maintained but empty. The telescope pointed at the same patch of sky, every night.

### Chapter 5: The Search
Not a photo album page — a detective board. Clippings, notes, theories. Where is Bella Goth? Mortimer's handwriting. Cassandra's drawings. Don Lothario's name, circled.
