# The Newbie Family Album

**A love story told through domestic survival.**

This is the story of Bob and Betty Newbie. How they started with §20,000 and a lot of optimism. How the kitchen caught fire (more than once). How Betty learned to cook and Bob learned to talk to the neighbors. How a tutorial family became a home.

## Pages

### Chapter 1: Moving Day
The Newbies arrive at Lot 1 with §20,000 and no furniture. Betty surveys the empty rooms with a clipboard she doesn't have but should. Bob waves at the nonexistent neighbors. The first purchase: a bed. Because Betty knows what matters.

### Chapter 2: The First Meal
Bob tries to cook. The stove disagrees. The fire department arrives for the first (not last) time. Betty takes over kitchen duties permanently. The first lesson: some jobs belong to the person with cooking skill.

### Chapter 3: Getting the Paper
The morning newspaper sits on the lawn with job listings. Bob finds "Test Subject" in the Science career. Betty eyes the Culinary track. The bills arrive on the same day. §20,000 feels smaller than it did yesterday.

### Chapter 4: Making Friends
Bob walks up to the neighbor (Mortimer Goth) and waves. Mortimer nods. Bob tries again. And again. His outgoing-8 personality won't stop trying. Eventually, Mortimer gives him a full conversation. Bob calls it a breakthrough. Mortimer calls it Tuesday.

### Chapter 5: The Routine
Monday through Friday: wake up, shower (Betty first, Bob forgets), eat (Betty cooks, Bob burns), go to work, come home, watch TV, sleep. Repeat. The domestic routine that The Sims turned into gameplay. In Simopolis, the routine turns into poetry.
