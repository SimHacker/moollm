# Goth Manor

**The mansion on the hill. Three stories of grief and grandeur.**

The Goth estate is the most expensive, most detailed, most narratively loaded lot in The Sims 1. Victorian architecture with wrought-iron details, a sprawling floor plan, and an infamous backyard. It was the house that told new players "someday, maybe" — the aspirational opposite of the Newbie starter home.

## Floor Plan

### Ground Floor
- **Foyer**: Grand entrance with chandelier. Sets the tone immediately.
- **Living Room**: Expensive couches, bookshelves, the big TV. Where guests are entertained.
- **Kitchen**: Well-equipped. Mortimer can cook (cooking 4). The counters are clean.
- **Dining Room**: Formal table. Seats the family and guests. Often empty now.
- **Study/Library**: Mortimer's refuge. Bookshelves wall-to-wall. Chess set. Thinking chair.

### Upper Floor
- **Master Bedroom**: The bed Bella no longer sleeps in. Mortimer uses one side.
- **Cassandra's Room**: Smaller. Piano. The window that overlooks the backyard.
- **Guest Room**: Unused. Immaculate. Waiting for someone who won't come.
- **Bathroom**: Expensive fixtures. Neat 7 household standards.

### Backyard
- **Swimming Pool**: Where Bella used to swim at midnight. Mortimer maintains it.
- **Telescope**: Pointed at the sky. Used every night. Not for astronomy.
- **Gravestones**: Old ones. From before the house, or from before the game explains itself.
- **Garden**: Maintained. Someone (Mortimer, probably) keeps the flowers alive.

## Notable Objects

| Object | Location | Significance |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Telescope | Backyard | Mortimer's nightly ritual. Searching. |
| Grand Piano | Cassandra's room | The sound that fills the silence. |
| Chess Set | Study | Logic 8. The game within the game. |
| Bookshelf (full) | Study | Every shelf filled. Knowledge as armor. |
| Swimming Pool | Backyard | Bella's domain. Now just water. |
| Gravestones | Backyard | The oldest objects on the lot. |

## Budget

The Goth family doesn't have budget problems. Old money. The house came with the family, or the family came with the house — the Goths blur that line. In-game, the lot value is the highest in the neighborhood.

## The Vibe

The house is beautiful and empty. Every room is maintained. Every surface is clean (neat 7). The furniture is expensive. The lighting is warm. But the house feels like a museum with two curators and no visitors. Three stories of space for two people. Cassandra practices piano and Mortimer reads in the study and the rooms between them echo.
