# Newbie House

**The starter home. Everyone's first lot.**

The Newbie house is what §20,000 buys after the lot: a one-bedroom, one-bathroom house with a kitchen that catches fire and a living room with the cheapest TV. It's the tutorial lot. The place where every player learned that Sims need to eat, sleep, shower, and go to the bathroom, and that forgetting any of these has consequences.

## Floor Plan

### The Whole House
- **Kitchen**: Cheap stove (fire risk: HIGH), basic fridge, small counter. The source of at least three fires per playthrough.
- **Living Room**: The cheapest TV, a couch that barely satisfies Comfort, a bookshelf with one cooking book.
- **Bedroom**: One double bed. Adequate. Betty keeps it made.
- **Bathroom**: One toilet, one shower. The most important room in the tutorial.
- **Front Yard**: Bare lawn. No landscaping. A mailbox that brings bills.

## Notable Objects

| Object | Location | Significance |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Cheap Stove | Kitchen | The fire machine. Bob's nemesis. |
| Basic Fridge | Kitchen | Contains food that becomes fires. |
| Cheapest TV | Living Room | Bob's primary entertainment. |
| Double Bed | Bedroom | One bed, two Sims. It works. |
| Toilet | Bathroom | The tutorial's star performer. |
| Mailbox | Front Yard | Bills arrive daily. Budget shrinks. |

## Budget

Starting budget: §20,000 minus lot cost. What remains: barely enough for the essential furniture. Every object was chosen from the cheapest tier because there's no money for anything else. The house is a lesson in budget management — or, more commonly, a lesson in how quickly money runs out.

## The Vibe

Humble. Honest. A little sad. The furniture doesn't match. The lawn is bare. The kitchen smells faintly of smoke. But it's home. Bob and Betty make it work because that's what the tutorial teaches you: start with nothing, build from there.
