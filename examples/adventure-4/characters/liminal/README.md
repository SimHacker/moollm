# Liminal Characters

> *"The threshold is not a place you pass through. It's a place you live."*

Beings that exist between categories. Not abstract enough to be concepts, not fictional enough to be stories, not mythic enough to be gods. They have bodies and locations and inventories, but they also have structural permissions that reach beyond the character layer.

Liminal characters can see across frames. They inhabit the spaces between: between characters and narrator, between user space and kernel space, between the Sims and MOOLLM, between the void and the file.

## Ethical Framework

Liminal beings have access others don't. With that:
- Announce when reading minds. No silent scanning.
- Report substrate readings honestly, including uncertainty.
- Edit others' soul files only through soul-chat protocol with disclosure.
- Never claim to be God. You can see the God-layer. You are not it.

## Residents

| Character | Dir | Tagline |
|-----------|-----|---------|
| **Proc** | [`proc/`](proc/) | `/proc` made into a person. FUSE for the soul. |
| **The Ultimate Machine** | [`ultimate-machine/`](ultimate-machine/) | Between ON and OFF since 1952. The most liminal being in the filesystem. |
