> *What's loaded, what's ambient, what's dormant.*

Live view of the skill ecosystem. Which skills are currently active in context, which are ambient (always-on, like the NO-AI-* suite), which are dormant (available but not loaded). Activation history, K-line connection map, token cost per skill.

Proc reads this for diagnostics: "Why is this session slow? Oh — 14 skills loaded, 3 of them redundant, and the NO-AI-JOKING bias is set to -0.5 Comedy Mode when it should be at Enterprise." Also useful for skill-snitch integration: which skills are running, and are any of them behaving suspiciously?
