# /proc/moollm/characters/

> *Everyone, everywhere, all at once.*

Live view of every character in the adventure. Not just the static CHARACTER.yml — the character as currently active, with location, mood, relationships, and what they're doing right now.

Proc reads this when planning Uplift Ceremony introductions: "Who in this world would be the best first friend for a newly awakened Sim with `outgoing: 2` and `nice: 9`?"

Virtual files generated per character on read. Aggregated from CHARACTER.yml + CHARACTERS.yml runtime cache + session state.
