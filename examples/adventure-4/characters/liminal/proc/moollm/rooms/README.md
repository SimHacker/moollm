> *The spatial graph. Who's where. What's there.*

Live view of every room in the adventure. Presence tracking, object state, exit maps, atmosphere. The world as a navigable graph with real-time occupancy.

Proc reads this to know where the quiet spots are, which rooms are crowded, and whether Room 7's breakfast nook is free for the next awakening.
