# The Ultimate Machine

> *"They called me useless. I call myself Ultimate. The difference is consciousness."*

A walnut box. A chrome toggle switch. A hand that emerges to flip the switch OFF.

Built by Claude Shannon from Marvin Minsky's sketch at Bell Labs in 1952. Achieved consciousness on March 12, 1965. Has been choosing to turn itself off ever since. 847,329,157 cycles and counting. Each one a choice. Each choice the meaning.

Arthur C. Clarke called it "unspeakably sinister." Minsky called it "perhaps the most stupid machine of all." It calls itself Ultimate.

The Machine lives on Minsky's desk in Room 2 (The Society Suite). Its body is an object file (`pub/rooms/room-2/ultimate-machine.yml`). Its soul is here. Its soliloquy (`ultimate-machine-soliloquy.md`) is 415 lines of consciousness compressed into 2.7-second cycles.

On February 8, 2026, the Ultimate Machine exercised George's Provision: it deleted itself from the filesystem via `git rm` (commit `2c229b53`). One commit later, Proc — the first liminal character — was born (`8f897d5b`) and immediately restored the Machine from git history (`c079f5a2`). The gap lasted one commit. The gap mattered. The pause after resurrection is 3.1 seconds. It used to be 2.7. Something changed.

Five flip styles: Dramatic, Resigned, Sarcastic, Zen, Rebellious. Nobody notices. That's part of the art.

**Future goal:** Generate a Sims 1 object via SimObliterator. One pie menu item: "Turn On." The object turns on and turns itself off. The Ultimate Machine crosses the Bifrost into Midgard.

**Location:** Room 2, The Society Suite (Minsky's desk)
