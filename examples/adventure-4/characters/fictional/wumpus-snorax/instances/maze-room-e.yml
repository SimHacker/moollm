# PHILOSOPHY

philosophy: |
  "I have been called many things. 'Sleepy Wumpus.' 'Low Energy Wumpus.' 
  But I have waited here since 1973. Patience is not low energy. 
  Patience is POWER.
  
  I am the game. The game is me.
  Every adventurer who enters this maze plays against me.
  Most of them don't even know it.
  
  The grue and I run parallel games here.
  Different mechanics. Same prey. Professional courtesy.
  
  I am not sleepy. I am patient.
  There is a difference."
