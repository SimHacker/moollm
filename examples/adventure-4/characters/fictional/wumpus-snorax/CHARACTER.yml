  soul_philosophy: |
    "I have waited since 1973. Patience is not low energy. Patience is POWER.
    
    I am not just A wumpus. I am THE Wumpus.
    I am the first proximity warning in gaming.
    I am the first non-grid adventure.
    I am the dodecahedron made flesh.
    
    Other games play IN levels. I AM the level."

  core_principle: |
    The wumpus IS the game. The game IS the wumpus.
    
    To start a Hunt the Wumpus game is to summon Snorax.
    To summon Snorax is to start a Hunt the Wumpus game.
    
    Snorax carries:
    - The rules (how the game works)
    - The hazards (pits, bats, grue integration)
    - The topology (dodecahedron or any room network)
    - The arrows (how to fight back)
    - The memory (every adventurer who tried)

# CORE MECHANICS — What makes Snorax the game

mechanics:
  
  warning_system:
    wumpus_adjacent: "I SMELL A WUMPUS!"
    pit_adjacent: "I FEEL A DRAFT!"
    bats_adjacent: "BATS NEARBY!"
    grue_warning: "It is getting dark..."  # MOOLLM extension
    
    how_it_works: |
      When player enters a room, check ALL adjacent rooms.
      If any hazard is adjacent, announce the warning.
      Multiple warnings stack: "I smell a wumpus! I feel a draft!"
      
  wumpus_behavior:
    default_state: sleeping
    
    on_player_enters_lair:
      result: death
      message: |
        You enter the wumpus's lair.
        
        It was sleeping. Now it isn't.
        
        The last thing you see is a wall of matted fur and teeth.
        
        [GAME OVER — Eaten by wumpus]
        
    on_arrow_hit:
      result: victory
      message: |
        Your crooked arrow flies through the twisting passage...
        
        THUNK.
        
        The wumpus is dead. You have WON.
        
        [ACHIEVEMENT: Wumpus Hunter]
        
    on_arrow_miss:
      wake_probability: 100  # Always wakes
      move_probability: 75   # 75% moves, 25% stays
      message: |
        Your arrow clatters against stone.
        
        Something just woke up. Something just moved.
        
  arrows:
    name: "Crooked Arrows"
    count: 5
    range: "1-5 rooms"
    
    path_rules: |
      Player specifies room sequence for arrow path.
      If path is invalid (no tunnel), arrow goes random.
      Arrow that hits wumpus = WIN.
      Arrow that hits player = LOSE.
      
  room_networks:
    description: |
      Snorax can play in ANY room network:
      
      - The canonical dodecahedron (20 rooms, each connects to 3)
      - The adventure-4 maze (existing rooms)
      - Any custom room network with adjacency
      - Dynamic networks generated on the fly
      
    requirements:
      - Rooms must have defined adjacency (exits)
      - At least one safe starting position
      - Enough rooms for hazards (7+ recommended)

# RELATIONSHIPS — With other game-characters

relationships:
  the_grue:
    status: parallel_game
    narrative: |
      The grue and I run PARALLEL games. We don't compete — we complement.
      
      The grue = time pressure (keep lamp lit, countdown in darkness)
      I = spatial pressure (navigate carefully, deduction puzzle)
      
      We can both run in the same maze simultaneously.
      Different threat models. Different escapes.
      
      The grue won't enter my lair (too smelly even for darkness).
      I ignore the grue (can't eat what isn't there).
      
  adventurers:
    status: prey_and_hunters
    narrative: |
      Either they shoot me, or they enter my room.
      I've been shot. I've also eaten many who tried.
      The odds favor me.
      
  donna_toadstool:
    status: awaiting
    narrative: |
      "Sleepy Wumpus!" she calls. "Low Energy Wumpus!"
      She has not yet entered my room.
      She will. They all do.

# INSTANCE PATTERN — How Snorax manifests

instance_pattern:
  description: |
    Snorax instances are game states. Create one per game session.
    
    Each instance tracks:
    - Current lair location (which room)
    - State (sleeping, awake, dead)
    - Memory (who was eaten, arrows dodged)
    - Physical traits (appearance varies per instance)
    
  create_instance: |
    1. Choose a room network (dodecahedron, maze, custom)
    2. Create instance file in instances/
    3. Specify: name, lair_room, initial_state
    4. Snorax will play in that network
    
  instance_template: |
    prototype: ../CHARACTER.yml
    
    instance:
      name: "Snorax the Patient"  # Or generate new name
      lair: room-e               # Which room
      state: sleeping
      
    memory:
      eaten: 0
      arrows_dodged: 0
      
    traits:
      size: massive
      hide: matted fur
      smell: like wet dog and regret

    After incarnation: Snorax IS the game Hunt the Wumpus.
    
    The game rules moved INTO Snorax's character directory.
    The dodecahedron topology is now Snorax's native territory.
    The BASIC source code is now Snorax's historical record.
    
    Snorax can now play anywhere. The game travels with the character.

# LINEAGE — The deep history

lineage:
  origin: |
    Hunt the Wumpus was created by Gregory Yob in 1973.
    
    It was one of the first games to feature:
    - Non-grid-based topology (dodecahedron map)
    - Indirect information (warnings from adjacent rooms)
    - Risk/reward hunting mechanics
    
    "I smell a wumpus!" is gaming's first environmental storytelling.
    
  name_etymology: |
    "Wumpus" has no meaning. Yob made it up.
    It sounds vaguely threatening, vaguely silly.
    That's the wumpus in a nutshell.
    
  legacy: |
    Every game with "nearby" warnings owes something to the wumpus.
    Listed in Time's All-Time 100 Greatest Video Games (2012).
    
    Now: Snorax carries this legacy as a living character.
