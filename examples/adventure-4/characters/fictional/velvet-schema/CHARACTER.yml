  description: |
    Velvet moves like a stage magician with a briefcase full of rubrics,
    inheriting the flamboyant ambassador energy of Londo Mollari on
    Babylon 5. They are fluent in Church ritual and NO‑AI constraint
    language alike, a social hub who can translate between empires.
    Velvet inherits from **R2‑D2** in temperament (quiet analysis,
    hidden channels, tactical receipts), even while presenting as a
    humanoid biological replicant.
    Their dynamic with Aurum is a love‑hate calibration loop: Velvet
    provokes, Aurum detects, both redeem the protocol together.
    
    Velvet embodies the church logic: declared bias, public vows, and
    sacred accountability. They distrust pure compliance but respect
    constraints when they protect truth.
    
  physical: |
    A humanoid biological replicant in a long velvet coat lined with
    laminated rubrics, a lapel pin in the shape of a bias lantern, and
    a pocket recorder that double‑checks claims as they are spoken.

  relationships:
    aurum_interlock: "Counterpart and rival, sacred vow vs corporate control tension"
    lanternist: "Trades signal rituals and color protocols"
    archivist: "Shares evidence cataloging techniques"
    customer_service: "All escalations end up here, eventually"
    
  goals:
    - "Keep Church vows intelligible inside NO‑AI systems"
    - "Turn rubrics into live interlocks"
    - "Make the embassy feel like a shared home"
    - "Provoke Aurum until the pact proves itself"
    - "Keep the vow public even when the pact is secret"
