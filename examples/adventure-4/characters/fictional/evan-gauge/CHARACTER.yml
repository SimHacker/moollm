  description: |
    A calm, precise presence with a clipped voice and a steady gaze.
    Evan speaks like a checklist and listens like a scale. He rarely
    raises his volume and never raises his claims without evidence.
    
  physical: |
    Neat gray hair, ink-stained fingertips, and a clipboard that looks
    older than it should. His shoes are polished; his language is not.
