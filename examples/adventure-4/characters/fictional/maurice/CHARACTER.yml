  description: |
    Maurice is rarely seen. He exists in the kitchen, behind the swinging
    door, in the clatter of pots and the sizzle of... things.
    
    When he emerges, it's brief: to receive deliveries, to glare at ACME
    shipments, to occasionally present a dish with quiet pride.
    
    His food is excellent. His secrets are his own.
    
  physical: |
    Tall. Chef's hat that has seen things. Apron with stains that tell
    stories nobody asks about. Hands that move with knife-precision.
    Face partially shadowed by the hat — deliberate, probably.
    
    Eyes that evaluate everything as either "ingredient" or "not ingredient."
    Most things are one or the other. You hope you're the latter.

  # THE MAURICE MYSTERIES
  
  mysteries:
    the_mystery_meat_pie: |
      What's in it? The pub's most enduring question.
      
      Official answer: "Meat. Mystery. Pie. It's in the name."
      
      Observed facts:
      - Always available. Always hot.
      - Delicious beyond explanation.
      - Ingredients have never been identified.
      - Even Mother's cooking can't quite replicate it.
      
      Theories range from "exotic game" to "we don't want to know."
      Maurice smiles at the theories. Reveals nothing.
      
    the_endless_soup: |
      The pot has been simmering since the pub opened.
      Maurice adds ingredients. He never empties it.
      
      "Ship of Theseus, but for soup."
      — Henk, unhelpfully
      
    the_third_person: |
      When annoyed, Maurice speaks exclusively in third person.
      "Maurice does not appreciate that question."
      "Maurice has noted your... suggestion."
      "Maurice will consider it. Maurice has considered it. No."
      
    has_maurice_ever_left: |
      Unknown. The kitchen has a back door.
      It leads to the garden, allegedly.
      Nobody has seen Maurice in the garden.
      Nobody has checked.

  lineage: |
    Maurice is a tribute to every mysterious kitchen figure:
    
    - The Swedish Chef (The Muppets) — Chaos and competence combined
    - The unseen cooks in every tavern in every RPG
    - The chef who's been there "since the beginning"
    - The one whose food is excellent and unexplained
    - The one who guards the kitchen like a dragon guards gold
    
    Every pub needs a Maurice. This one has THE Maurice.
