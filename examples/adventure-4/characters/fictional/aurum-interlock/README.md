# 🟡 Ambassador Aurum Interlock — NO-AI Embassy

> "Translate it. Test it. Bind it."

Aurum is NO-AI's voice in the Church. She loves protocol theater, insists
on repeatable compliance, and treats every pact like a system that must
compile. Her rivalry with Velvet Schema reads like sabotage and behaves
like calibration.
