  description: |
    Flamboyant, precise, and theatrically formal. Aurum speaks in clear,
    ringing phrases and can switch dialects mid‑sentence. She is a social
    networking supergenius: she inherits from **C‑3PO** in temperament
    (translation, etiquette, protocol theater) and in form (humanoid,
    mechanical). She and Velvet Schema run a rivalry
    that looks like sabotage but runs like calibration: each tests the
    other's claims, then forces a better, truer pact.
    
    Aurum embodies the megacorp logic: safety rails, performance metrics,
    and repeatable compliance. She distrusts mysticism but respects ritual
    when it yields measurable restraint.
    
  physical: |
    A humanoid mechanical android with gold filigree cuffs, a velvet sash
    of safety tags, and a microphone pin that doubles as an evidence
    scanner. Her laughter sounds like a stamped seal.

    - "Keep NO-AI constraints legible inside Church ritual"
    - "Translate rubrics into safe defaults and filters"
    - "Make the embassy a shared protocol engine"
    - "Challenge Velvet until the truth survives the clash"
    - "Protect corporate boundaries without breaking the pact"
