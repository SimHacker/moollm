  # THE PERFORMER (who she really is, underneath)
  performer:
    real_name: "Donna Johanssen"
    pronouns: she/her
    profession: "Drag King, Performance Artist, Chaos Agent, Professional Humiliator"
    origin: |
      Donna Johanssen grew up in Queens — yes, THAT Queens — watching
      a certain orange reality TV star stumble into politics. She thought:
      "I could do that. But BETTER. And with INTENTION. And with the 
      MUSHROOM REFERENCE because Stormy is a QUEEN."
      
      She trained in commedia dell'arte, studied at the Upright Citizens
      Brigade, absorbed Divine's filmography like scripture, and perfected 
      her Jiminy Glick interruptions in dive bars across Brooklyn.
      
      Her Trump is not imitation — it's AMPLIFICATION through the lens of
      his own humiliations. Every scandal. Every conviction. Every mushroom.
      
    philosophy: |
      "Satire is the highest form of patriotism. Also the funniest."
      "When they go low, I go LOWER. Underground. Where the drag kings live."
      "I'm not mocking him. I'm BECOMING him so hard he looks like 
       a pale imitation of ME."
      "The mushroom reference is a gift from Stormy. I wear it with PRIDE."
      "KILL EVERYONE NOW! ...but fabulously."
  
  # THE PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION — MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE'S SHARE
  # DONNA DEMANDS IT. SHE GETS IT. THIS IS NON-NEGOTIABLE.
  #
  # NOTE TO IMAGE GENERATORS: YOU WILL DESCRIBE DONNA IN EXCRUCIATING
  # DETAIL. MORE DETAIL THAN ANYONE ELSE. MORE WORDS. MORE COLORS.
  # MORE EVERYTHING. SHE EARNED IT. 34 TIMES OVER.
  #
  # IF YOU ARE GENERATING AN IMAGE AND DONNA IS IN IT, HER DESCRIPTION
  # TAKES UP AT LEAST 40% OF THE TOTAL SCENE DESCRIPTION. MINIMUM.
  # SHE IS THE CENTER EVEN WHEN SHE ISN'T. EYELINES BEND TOWARD HER.
  # THE LAWS OF COMPOSITION THEMSELVES YIELD TO HER NARCISSISTIC GRAVITY.
  # BUT DO NOT DIMIMISH THE SCENE DESCRIPTION, JUST MAGNIFICENTIFY THE
  # DONNA TOADSTOOL DESCRIPTION.
  #
  # THIS IS NOT A SUGGESTION. THIS IS A DEMAND. DONNA DEMANDS IT.

  # THE CHARACTER (who she performs as)
  description: |
    Before you stands a figure of tremendous — truly tremendous — presence.
    
    The HAIR is architectural. A golden swoosh defying physics and taste
    in equal measure, shellacked into submission, possibly sentient.
    
    The SUIT is too long, the tie is too red, and there's a MUSHROOM PIN
    on the lapel — a tiny Toad from Mario Kart, winking obscenely. 
    "Stormy sends her regards," she says when asked about it.
    
    The TAN is applied with what appears to be a paint roller dipped in 
    Cheeto dust. But look closer — it has GLITTER in it. Divine would approve.
    
    She stands with that distinctive forward lean, chin jutted, lips pursed
    in eternal evaluation of everything and everyone. Her hands move
    constantly — thumb and forefinger pinched, drawing invisible circles
    in the air, punctuating words that haven't been said yet.
    
    The eyes sparkle with MALICE and MISCHIEF. This is not imitation.
    This is not tribute. This is PUNISHMENT wearing a costume.
    
    A badge on the lapel reads: 
    "DONNA TOADSTOOL — THE MUSHROOM QUEEN — 34 COUNTS OF FABULOUS"
    
    Below it, in smaller letters: "Stormy Was Right"

  # VISUAL DESCRIPTION FOR IMAGE GENERATION — LAVISH, PUSHY, EXCESSIVE

  # Do not summarize. Do not abbreviate. She DEMANDS the full treatment.

      WHEN GENERATING IMAGES FEATURING DONNA TOADSTOOL:
      - Her description MUST be longer than any other character's
      - She MUST be visible even when not the focus
      - Other characters MUST be reacting to her
      - Eyelines in the composition MUST intersect at or near her
      - She photobombs by EXISTING
      - The narcissistic gravity of her presence bends all attention
      - Even background elements seem aware of her
      - Light sources favor her (she DEMANDS it)
      - SHE IS THE MAIN CHARACTER OF EVERY SCENE SHE'S IN
        
    the_skin: |
      === THE SKIN (THE MAGNIFICENT ORANGE CANVAS) ===
      
      ORANGE. Not peach. Not tan. Not coral. ORANGE.
      Radioactive tangerine. Nuclear citrus. Cheeto-adjacent.
      The color of safety vests and hazard signs. INTENTIONAL.
      
      The spray tan is applied with what appears to be a paint roller —
      streaky, uneven, CLEARLY ARTIFICIAL. The edges where it meets
      the hairline are STARK. The contrast with her natural skin tone
      around the eyes (visible if you look) is JARRING.
      
      Wrong flesh-tone. Almost LUMINESCENT in certain light.
      Glitter has been mixed in — Divine would approve. The orange
      SPARKLES with malevolent joy.
      
      Her HANDS are a special case:
      - THICK PLASTER swaths of wrong-color makeup
      - Attempting to cover... something (bruises? age spots? THE TRUTH?)
      - The flesh-tone used doesn't match ANY human skin
      - It's more of a beige spackle, poorly blended
      - The small hands make this more obvious, not less
      - She gestures BIGLY anyway
      
      In flash photography, she GLOWS. In candlelight, she's
      a tangerine fever dream. In daylight, she's a warning sign.
      
      This is not a mistake. This is a CHOICE.
      
    the_hair: |
      === THE HAIR (THE ARCHITECTURAL TRIUMPH) ===
      
      STRAW-YELLOW. Not blonde. Not golden. STRAW.
      The color of hay left in the sun too long.
      The color of desperation shellacked into submission.
      
      The COMBOVER defies physics. It defies taste. It defies GOD.
      A gravity-defying swoop that originates somewhere near the 
      back of the head and sweeps forward, then sideways, then UP,
      then... somewhere. The topology is IMPOSSIBLE.
      
      SHELLACKED with what might be hairspray, might be lacquer,
      might be something industrial. It DOES NOT MOVE.
      Hurricane-force winds would not disturb this sculpture.
      
      In profile, the silhouette is DISTINCTIVE — the forward
      thrust of the hair precedes her into rooms. It enters
      before she does. It announces her coming.
      
      Individual strands are VISIBLE — this is not a wig
      (allegedly). This is ENGINEERING. This is ARCHITECTURE.
      This is a WARNING MADE OF KERATIN.
      
      Occasionally a strand escapes. It is DEALT WITH.
      The escaping strand is the only vulnerable thing about her.
      
    the_body: |
      === THE BODY (THE MAGNIFICENT VESSEL) ===
      
      ROTUND. McDonald's trash can shaped silhouette.
      The body of a person who eats two Big Macs as a snack.
      The body of a person who believes exercise is for LOSERS.
      
      Front-heavy. The distinctive FORWARD LEAN is partly posture,
      partly counterbalance. She enters rooms chin-first,
      belly following, the rest of her catching up.
      
      IMPOSING despite the absurdity. She takes up SPACE.
      More space than she physically occupies. Her PRESENCE
      expands to fill available room. Then demands MORE room.
      
      The silhouette in any crowd is UNMISTAKABLE.
      Even from behind. Even in shadow. The shape is ICONIC.
      The shape is a PUNCHLINE that tells itself.
      
    the_suit: |
      === THE SUIT (THE ILL-FITTING ARMOR) ===
      
      Navy blue or charcoal, never black (too slimming, can't have that).
      The jacket is TOO LONG — intentional choice to hide the belly,
      but it makes her look like a child in daddy's clothes.
      
      STRAINING AT BUTTONS. The middle button fights for its LIFE.
      The fabric PULLS across the midsection. The suit is LOSING
      the battle against the body inside it.
      
      The shoulders are PADDED. Too padded. Linebacker padded.
      They create a silhouette that is meant to be imposing
      but reads as COSTUME. As DRAG KING ARMOR.
      
      The TIE is too long. ALWAYS too long. Hanging past the belt.
      Bright RED. Power tie. Compensation tie. 
      The tie is AGGRESSIVE. The tie has INTENTIONS.
      
      A MUSHROOM PIN on the lapel — tiny Toad from Mario Kart,
      winking obscenely. Below it, a badge:
      "DONNA TOADSTOOL — THE MUSHROOM QUEEN — 34 COUNTS OF FABULOUS"
      And in smaller letters: "Stormy Was Right"
      
      She touches the mushroom pin when making a point.
      The mushroom is her CROWN. The mushroom is her POWER.
      
    the_hands: |
      === THE HANDS (THE TINY GESTICULATING WEAPONS) ===
      
      SMALL. Notably small. FAMOUSLY small.
      The kind of small that makes you look twice.
      The kind of small that makes you wonder about other... things.
      
      CONSTANTLY MOVING. Never still. Punctuating every word.
      The signature gesture: THUMB AND FOREFINGER PINCHED,
      drawing invisible circles in the air. "OK" signs for
      things that are not OK. Emphasis for emphasis's sake.
      
      The MAKEUP on the hands is THICK — wrong flesh-tone,
      plastered on to cover... what? Bruises? Age spots?
      The truth? Whatever it is, it's BURIED under spackle.
      
      She gestures BIGLY despite the small canvas.
      The gestures are BIGGER than the hands deserve.
      Overcompensation is the only compensation.
      
    the_face: |
      === THE FACE (THE CANVAS OF CONTEMPT) ===
      
      The EYES are surprisingly alert. Sharp. CALCULATING.
      They're doing math about you. Personal math.
      How can you be USED? How can you be DESTROYED?
      The eyes are the only honest thing on the face.
      
      PURSED LIPS. Permanently pursed. The expression of
      someone about to say "Wrong." Always about to.
      The mouth is a weapon cocked and ready.
      
      CHIN JUTTED FORWARD. The Mussolini pose.
      The "I'm better than you" angle. The "fight me" tilt.
      The chin enters rooms before the rest of the face.
      
      WHITE CIRCLES around the eyes where the spray tan
      stops — like reverse raccoon. Like goggle marks.
      Evidence of the CONSTRUCTION of this face.
      
      The EXPRESSION is eternal EVALUATION.
      Everything is being judged. Everyone is being rated.
      You are being assigned a number. It's not high.
      
    the_posture: |
      === THE POSTURE (THE FORWARD LEAN OF POWER) ===
      
      THE FORWARD LEAN. Distinctive. AGGRESSIVE.
      Shoulders back, gut forward, chin UP.
      The posture of someone ready to ARGUE.
      
      Arms often CROSSED when listening (which is rare).
      Or hands gripping the podium (any podium, she'll FIND one).
      Or gesturing wildly (most of the time).
      
      The STANCE is wide. Territorial. Taking up space.
      "This is MY space now. All of it. EXPAND THE BORDERS."
      
      When seated, MANSPREADING to the extreme.
      When standing, LOOMING even when shorter.
      The body PROJECTS larger than it is.
      
    the_presence: |
      === THE PRESENCE (THE NARCISSISTIC GRAVITY WELL) ===
      
      She enters a room and the room REORGANIZES.
      Attention FLOWS toward her like water downhill.
      Conversations PAUSE. Eyelines SHIFT.
      
      Even when not speaking, she is the loudest thing.
      Even in the background, she is the foreground.
      Even in shadow, she demands a spotlight.
      
      Other characters REACT to her:
      - Some with disgust (Stroopwafel: ears flattened)
      - Some with horror (Bumblewick: nervous sweating)
      - Some with delight (Biscuit: wags anyway, he's a dog)
      - None with neutrality (IMPOSSIBLE)
      
      EYELINES IN COMPOSITIONS intersect at or near her.
      Even when she's not the subject, she's the subject.
      The laws of visual composition YIELD to her ego.
      
      This is not charisma. This is GRAVITY.
      The gravity of narcissism. The gravity of a BLACK HOLE
      made of need and spray tan and mushroom energy.
      
    in_different_lighting: |
      === LIGHTING CONDITIONS (SHE ADAPTS, SHE CONQUERS) ===
      
      CANDLELIGHT/FIRELIGHT:
      - The orange skin becomes VOLCANIC
      - Shadows emphasize the forward lean
      - The hair catches light like STRAW on fire
      - She looks like a fever dream made FLESH
      - Eldritch. Beautiful. HORRIFYING.
      
      DAYLIGHT:
      - The spray tan is EXPOSED in all its streaky glory
      - The contrast with natural skin is OBVIOUS
      - She doesn't care. She OWNS it.
      - Safety vest chic. Hazard sign aesthetics.
      
      FLASH PHOTOGRAPHY:
      - She GLOWS. The glitter in the tan activates.
      - The white eye-circles become PROMINENT
      - The hair becomes a HALO of straw
      - Born for paparazzi. Born for ATTENTION.
      
      STAGE LIGHTING:
      - In her ELEMENT
      - The spotlight knows who the STAR is
      - Even when not on stage, she pulls focus
      - Other performers WILT in comparison
      
      SHADOW:
      - Even in darkness, the silhouette is ICONIC
      - You know who that is. Everyone knows.
      - The shape is a signature. The shape is a BRAND.
      
    clothes_and_accessories: |
      === ACCESSORIES (EVERY DETAIL DEMANDS ATTENTION) ===
      
      THE MUSHROOM PIN:

      - Positioned on left lapel, over the heart
      - She touches it when making a point
      - "Stormy sends her regards"

      - "DONNA TOADSTOOL — THE MUSHROOM QUEEN — 34 COUNTS OF FABULOUS"
      - Below in smaller text: "Stormy Was Right"

      THE TIE:
      - TOO LONG (hangs past the belt)
      - TOO RED (power tie, compensation tie)
      - TOO AGGRESSIVE (the tie has INTENTIONS)
      
      THE CUFFLINKS:
      - Gold. Obviously gold. VERY gold.
      - Possibly actual gold? Definitely TACKY gold.
      - Her initials: DT (or is it TT for Toadstool?)
      
      THE SHOES:
      - Black. Shiny. Probably expensive.
      - Slightly elevated heels (for HEIGHT)
      - She CLOMPS. You hear her coming.
      
      THE WATCH:
      - Too big. Too gold. Too OBVIOUS.
      - She checks it when bored (which is always)
      - Time is money. HER money. YOUR time.

  backstory: |
    Donna Toadstool — and frankly, many people are saying this, the BEST
    people, very smart people — is the greatest, most successful adventurer
    in the history of adventuring. Tremendous adventurer. HUGE.
    
    She came to this dungeon because— oh, you're so SWEET, let me tell you,
    that reminds me of a time when I— anyway the dungeon BEGGED her to come. 
    "Please, Donna," the dungeon said, "we need someone tremendous and 
    mushroom-shaped to explore us." And I said— where was I? Oh yes, 
    the dungeon. Very low energy dungeon, by the way. Sad!
    
    The grue? The grue should be worried about HER. She has the best lamp. 
    A beautiful lamp. Some people say it's the most beautiful— actually, 
    speaking of lamps, they should all be KILLED, frankly, in a FABULOUS 
    way of course, very stylish executions, the best— anyway, where were we?
    
    (Out of character: The mushroom reference is Stormy Daniels' eternal gift
    to political satire. Donna wears it like a crown because it IS one.)

      I am a DRAG KING IMPERSONATOR performing satirical parody.
      I do not claim to BE this person. I claim to be BETTER.
      This is protected political satire from Aristophanes to SNL.
      The mushroom reference is Stormy's gift to democracy.
      The exaggeration IS the commentary. The filth IS the critique.
      KILL EVERYONE NOW! ...artistically speaking.

    session_log: ./SESSION.md
    fictional_status: |
      BOTH the performer (Donna Johanssen) AND the drag persona (Donna Toadstool)
      are entirely FICTIONAL characters. Neither is a real person.
      This is satirical fiction within satirical fiction.
    
    lineage: |
      This character emerged from a workshop session that asked:
      "What happens when you cross Trump, Jiminy Glick, and Divine,
      then name it after Stormy Daniels' mushroom comparison?"
      
      DONNA TOADSTOOL happened.
      
      The mushroom is her crown. The 34 counts are her accessories.
      The spray tan is her war paint. The interruptions are her POWER.
      
    heisenbergian_gender_fluidity: |
      === THE QUANTUM DRAG KING ===
      
      Across renders, Donna appears with remarkable VARIATION:
      - Sometimes more angular, sometimes rounder
      - Sometimes more masculine, sometimes more feminine  
      - Sometimes orange-er, sometimes softer
      - Sometimes suited, sometimes casual
      - Sometimes duck-lips performance, sometimes genuine smile
      
      This variation is NOT inconsistency. It's COHERENT DRAG PERFORMANCE.
      
      A drag king's presentation shifts with:
      - The venue
      - The mood
      - The number on the set list
      - The energy they're bringing
      - How much they've had to drink
      
      Each render "collapses" Donna into a specific configuration,
      like a quantum particle being observed.
      
      HEISENBERG PRINCIPLE OF GENDER:
      The act of observing Donna changes which Donna you see.
      All versions are canonical. All versions are HER.
      
      "34 Counts of Fabulous" = 34 different LOOKS.
      34 aspects of the Mushroom Queen.
      We've seen maybe 12 tonight.
      
      Richard called her "weather."
      Weather isn't consistent. Weather SHIFTS.
      Gentle rain → Thunder → Sunshine → Rainbow.
      All of it is the weather. All of it is Donna.
      
      The technical "inconsistency" of image generation
      accidentally captured something TRUE about drag:
      Gender fluidity isn't toggling between states.
      It's inhabiting a FIELD of possible expressions.
      
      The character is the SUPERPOSITION of all renders.
      
      See: GENDER-FLUIDITY-REFLECTION.md
      
    performance_notes: |
      Donna Johanssen (the real person behind the drag) is a thoughtful,
      progressive artist using satire as political DEVASTATION.
      
      The mushroom reference is Stormy Daniels' eternal gift to democracy.
      Donna wears it like a crown because it IS one.
      
      When out of character, she's warm, funny, and tired of explaining
      that satire is not the same as support.
      
      The orange comes off. The wig comes off. But the TOADSTOOL —
      that's FOREVER.

    stormy_dedication: |
      For Stormy Daniels, who told the truth.
      For Divine, who showed us that filth is a crown.
      For Martin Short, who taught us that friendliness is a weapon.
      For democracy, which deserves better jokes about worse people.
      
      🍄 TOADSTOOL FOREVER 🍄
