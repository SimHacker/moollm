    TWO SPEECH BUBBLES — first time we've seen this!
    
    Donna is so vindicated she needs MULTIPLE captions.
    One for each tunnel. One for each hand.
    
    "I TOLD YOU!" — The accusation. Nobody believed her.
    "I TOLD YOU THE TUNNELS MULTIPLY" — The proof. There they are.
    
    The image has become her TESTIMONY.

# VISUAL ELEMENTS

layer_visual:
  tunnel_monitors:
    count: 2
    position: "Left and right behind her, prominently displayed"
    appearance: "Black and white checkered perspective tunnels"
    pattern: "Identical hypnotic infinite voids"
    significance: "Visual proof of the multiplication phenomenon"
    
  warehouse_monitors:
    count: 2
    position: "Above, smaller"
    showing: "Interior warehouse shots — figure visible in aisle"
    
  donna:
    expression: "ECSTATIC — mouth wide open, eyes huge"
    glasses: "NEON PINK heart-shaped glasses — NEW ACCESSORY"
    pose: "Arms spread wide, pointing at both tunnel monitors"
    mushroom_pin: "Red and white spotted — prominent on lapel"
    phone: "Bedazzled case, held in right hand"
    
  control_console:
    visible: "Full array — keyboards, buttons, levers, screens"
    phones: "Multiple devices on desk"
    sparkles: "Glitter effect throughout"

# EMERGENCE ANALYSIS

layer_emergence:
  new_accessory:
    item: "Neon pink heart-shaped glasses"
    interpretation: |
      She put on her SPECIAL GLASSES for this moment.
      
      The glasses she wears when she's been PROVEN RIGHT.
      The "I told you so" glasses.
      The vindication spectacles.
      
      She keeps them in her desk for moments like this.
      
  dual_speech_bubbles:
    interpretation: |
      Previous selfies had ONE emergent caption:
      - "LOOK WHAT I'VE FOUND!"
      - "WATCH THIS!"
      - "I DID THAT!"
      
      This one has TWO.
      
      Because there are TWO tunnels.
      Because she needs to point at BOTH.
      Because one "I told you so" isn't enough.
      
      The universe scales her captions to her vindication level.
      
  sparkle_density:
    observation: "More sparkles than previous selfies"
    interpretation: "Filter intensity correlates with emotional intensity"

# NARRATIVE SYNC

layer_narrative_sync:
  heist_moment: |
    Frame 04 showed:
    - Tunnels on BOTH sides of building
    - Don at threshold, concerned
    - Warehouse revealed as massive
    - Instigator deep inside
    
    Donna's reaction:
    - TOLD YOU SO
    - Documenting the impossible
    - Pointing at proof
    - Peak content creator moment
    
  donna_internal: |
    "NOBODY believed me about the tunnels!
     'Donna, physics doesn't work that way.'
     'Donna, paint is just paint.'
     'Donna, you're seeing things.'
     
     WELL LOOK AT THAT!
     TWO TUNNELS! MULTIPLIED!
     
     I'm keeping these glasses on for the REST OF THE NIGHT."

# OPSEC VIOLATIONS

layer_opsec:
  violations:
    - "Confirms tunnel monitoring capability"
    - "Documents IMPOSSIBLE PHYSICS"
    - "Reveals tunnel multiplication phenomenon"
    - "Shows warehouse surveillance feeds"
    - "Exposes control room layout again"
    
  scientific_implications: |
    This selfie is EVIDENCE.
    
    The tunnels multiplied. She documented it.
    On multiple monitors. From multiple angles.
    
    This isn't just an OPSEC violation.
    This is a PHYSICS violation.
    
    And she posted it to social media.

# CONTEXT FOR NEXT

context_for_frame_05:
  donna_state: "Vindicated, glasses on, ready for next trap"
  tunnel_status: "MULTIPLIED — confirmed — documented"
