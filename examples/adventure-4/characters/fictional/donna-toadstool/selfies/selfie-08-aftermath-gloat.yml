     That last one wasn't me. Probably.
     
     BUT LOOK AT THEM! Across the street! Looking back!
     The 'what just happened' pose!
     The 'we survived' stance!
     The 'never again' faces!
     
     PREMIUM CONTENT. CHEF'S KISS. PERFECTION.
     
     Now I should probably...
     
     ...take ONE more selfie.
     
     Then evacuate.
     
     Maybe."
