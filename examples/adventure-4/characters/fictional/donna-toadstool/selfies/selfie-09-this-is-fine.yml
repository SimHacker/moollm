    "Huh.
     
     The tunnel is eating the professor.
     
     That's... new.
     
     And the tie-dye guy is a rabbit now.
     A whole rabbit. Hopping around.
     
     ...
     
     This is fine.
     
     Everything is fine.
     
     The building is on fire.
     The tunnel is hungry.
     There's a rabbit in a hoodie.
     
     Totally normal night at ACME.
     
     ...I should take a selfie."
