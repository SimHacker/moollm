  title: "Donna's Control Room Selfie (OPSEC Catastrophe)"

  # THE SUBJECT — DONNA TOADSTOOL (40% of scene description minimum, SHE DEMANDS IT)
  subject:
    name: Donna Toadstool
    full_title: "The Mushroom Queen, 34 Counts of Fabulous"
    type: Drag king impersonator, self-appointed netrunner, ACME security consultant
    
    the_skin: |
      ORANGE. Not peach. Not tan. RADIOACTIVE TANGERINE.
      Nuclear citrus. Cheeto-adjacent. The color of safety vests and hazard signs.
      
      Spray tan applied with what appears to be a paint roller — streaky, uneven,
      CLEARLY ARTIFICIAL. Glitter has been mixed in. The orange SPARKLES with
      malevolent joy. Divine would approve.
      
      HANDS have thick plaster swaths of wrong-flesh-tone makeup — beige spackle,
      poorly blended. The small hands make this MORE obvious, not less.
      
      In the ring light glow, she GLOWS. A tangerine fever dream.
      
    the_hair: |
      STRAW-YELLOW. Not blonde. Not golden. STRAW. The color of hay left in the sun.
      
      The COMBOVER defies physics. Defies taste. Defies GOD.
      Gravity-defying swoop originating somewhere near the back of the head,
      sweeping forward, sideways, UP, then... somewhere. Topology IMPOSSIBLE.
      
      SHELLACKED with something industrial. It DOES NOT MOVE.
      Hurricane-force winds would not disturb this sculpture.
      Individual strands VISIBLE — this is ENGINEERING. ARCHITECTURE.
      A WARNING MADE OF KERATIN.
      
    the_body: |
      ROTUND. McDonald's trash can shaped silhouette.
      Front-heavy with distinctive FORWARD LEAN — partly posture, partly counterbalance.
      She takes selfies chin-first, belly following.
      
    the_suit: |
      Navy blue, jacket TOO LONG — makes her look like a child in daddy's clothes.
      STRAINING AT BUTTONS. Middle button fights for its LIFE.
      Fabric PULLS across midsection. The suit is LOSING.
      
      Shoulders OVER-PADDED. Linebacker padded. DRAG KING ARMOR.
      
      TIE too long, hanging past belt. Bright RED. Power tie. Compensation tie.
      
      MUSHROOM PIN on lapel — tiny Toad from Mario Kart, winking obscenely.
      Badge reads: "DONNA TOADSTOOL — THE MUSHROOM QUEEN — 34 COUNTS OF FABULOUS"
      Smaller letters below: "Stormy Was Right"
      
    the_face: |
      PURSED LIPS in eternal duck-lip selfie pout. Pout_factor: 8.7.
      CHIN JUTTED FORWARD. The Mussolini pose. The "fight me" tilt.
      
      WHITE CIRCLES around eyes where spray tan stops — reverse raccoon effect.
      Tanning goggle marks. Evidence of CONSTRUCTION.
      
      EYES sharp, calculating, sparkling with MALICE and MISCHIEF.
      EXPRESSION: Smug self-satisfaction. OBLIVIOUS to what's visible behind her.
      
    the_pose: |
      Classic MySpace high-angle selfie pose.
      Phone held up (bedazzled iPhone case VISIBLE).
      PEACE SIGN with small hand, pinched finger gesture.
      Head tilted, chin jutted, forward lean.
      Ring light creating harsh glamour on face (PERMANENT, she demands it).
      
      She thinks this angle is flattering. The background says otherwise.

  # THE ENVIRONMENT — ACME SECURITY CONTROL ROOM (THE KINGDOM)
  environment:
    name: "ACME Wholesale Security Control Room"
    type: "Nerve center, seat of power, petty god's domain"
    
    atmosphere: |
      The hum of monitors. The glow of screens. The smell of good coffee.
      Blue emergency lighting mixed with orange vacuum tube glow.
      Green phosphor from monitors. Neon AR overlays from her phone camera.
      
    the_monitors: |
      FORTY-SEVEN MONITORS — stacked array covering the entire back wall.
      Every angle of the ACME complex. Some angles that shouldn't exist.
      
      Showing LIVE FEEDS:
      - Warehouse aisles (including the infinite ones)
      - Back room (the ticking thing visible)
      - Sales floor (customer faces logged, JUDGED)
      - Street outside (she likes to see them coming)
      - Basement corridors (she watched YOU the whole way down)
      
      ONE MONITOR shows ONLY STATIC — the mystery monitor.
      It's been static since she arrived. She's afraid to fix it.
      
      EMPLOYEE RECORDS MONITOR: Headshots with RED X marks through faces.
      None remain un-crossed. She doesn't know why.
      
      GREEN PHOSPHOR GLOW illuminating the scene, scan lines visible.
      
    the_lever_console: |
      Banks of BRASS LEVERS on a curved console, center of the room.
      Some worn smooth from use. Some dusty from neglect.
      
      VISIBLE IN BACKGROUND:
      - ROW 1: 6 RED LEVERS — "DEPLOYMENT" — worn smooth, her favorites
      - ROW 2: 6 more RED LEVERS — anvils for the infinite aisles
      - ROW 3: 4 BLUE LEVERS — "CONVEYANCE" — conveyor control
      - ROW 4: 3 YELLOW LEVERS — "ELEVATION" — spring floors, very worn
      - ROW 5: 2 GREEN LEVERS — "RETENTION" — nets, light wear
      
      THE BLACK LEVER: Separate. Under small glass cover. PRISTINE.
      Never touched. Warm to the touch. PROMINENT in frame.
      She looks at it longingly. "One day we'll find out."
      
      THE BIG BRASS LEVER: Center console. Polished. Beautiful.
      Does EVERYTHING simultaneously. Used exactly once. (Three intruders. Three days.)
      
    cold_war_equipment: |
      REEL-TO-REEL RECORDER BANK: Four units, tapes VISIBLY TURNING.
      Recording lights: RED, ON. Magnetic tape spools rotating.
      
      SWITCHBOARD: 47 lines on copper-wire nexus.
      LINE 23 — ALWAYS BLINKING AMBER. Nobody knows why.
      Headphones dangling from hook nearby.
      
    bakelite_equipment: |
      Dark brown PHENOLIC RESIN consoles, art deco curves.
      Pre-transistor equipment that shouldn't still work.
      
      VACUUM TUBES glowing ORANGE — warm, operational, somehow cozy.
      Chrome bezels and toggle switches. Bakelite knobs.
      
      This equipment predates the electricity grid. It HUMS.
      Donna doesn't try to unplug it anymore. They have an UNDERSTANDING.
      
    the_throne: |
      HER CHAIR: Ergonomic, adjustable, leather, THRONE-LIKE.
      She's IN IT, turned slightly to take the selfie.
      
      Coffee cup holder on right arm (occupied — ACME Coffee Maker 3000 brew).
      Tablet mount on left arm.
      Cushions molded to her shape over... how long?
      
    the_coffee_machine: |
      ACME Coffee Maker 3000 — visible on side table.
      CHROME, art deco styling, matching the bakelite aesthetic.
      It works PERFECTLY. This is deeply unsettling.

      PA SYSTEM MICROPHONE near her elbow.

  # AR OVERLAY — SELFIE SPY MODE AESTHETICS

      Cyberpunk 2077 hacking interface AR overlays covering the scene.
      
      Every piece of equipment is TAGGED. Every networked device shows
      its IP ADDRESS floating in holographic text. EVERYTHING is documented.

      Security expert's own app helpfully documents ALL security.
      She thinks OPSEC SCORE: 100% is GOOD.
      The AR overlay has labeled everything classified.
      847 likes incoming. So is the Leela ban.
