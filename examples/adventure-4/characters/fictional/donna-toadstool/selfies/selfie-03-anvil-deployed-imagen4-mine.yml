# LAYER 1: THE MOMENT OF TRIUMPH
layer_celebration:
  donna_pose:
    both_arms: "RAISED — full victory gesture"
    fist: "Pumped in triumph"
    phone: "Held high, still recording"
    mouth: "WIDE OPEN — screaming victory"
    expression: "PURE UNCUT TRIUMPH"
    
  energy: |
    This is the moment.
    
    She pulled the lever. The anvil deployed. 
    Pattern Boy is on the monitor, arms raised in shock.
    Everything worked EXACTLY as designed.
    
    And Donna is CELEBRATING.
    With a selfie.
    Posted immediately.
    
# LAYER 2: THE MONITOR EVIDENCE
layer_anvil_evidence:
  what_the_monitor_shows:
    text: "'ANVIL' and 'DEPLOYED' clearly visible"
    image: "The doorway, the anvil falling, a figure below"
    figure: "Someone in a COLORFUL JACKET with arms raised"
    
  narrative_sync: |
    The monitor shows EXACTLY what Frame 03 captured:
    - Don in his psychedelic jacket
    - Arms raised (either dodging or shocked)
    - The anvil above him
    - The moment of deployment
    
    Donna is watching the SAME EVENT we saw in Frame 03.
    She's CELEBRATING it.
    She's POSTING it.
    
  opsec_violations:
    - "Confirmed: Anvils are part of security system"
    - "Confirmed: They can be DEPLOYED (not just gravity)"
    - "Confirmed: She has a button/lever for this"
    - "Visual confirmation of active deployment"
    - "Intruder appearance documented"
    
# LAYER 3: THE "I DID THAT" DECLARATION
layer_caption:
  text: "I DID THAT!"
  color: "Gold — premium victory text"
  placement: "Bottom of frame, declaration energy"
  
  implications: |
    "I DID THAT!" is a confession.
    
    She's not just watching intruders.
    She's not just monitoring security.
    She's CLAIMING CREDIT for the deployment.
    
    This selfie, posted publicly, includes:
    - Her face
    - The event
    - The statement "I DID THAT"
    
    This is a signed confession.
    With hashtags.
    
# LAYER 4: DOUBLE MUSHROOM PINS
layer_mushrooms:
  observed: "TWO mushroom pins visible on lapel"
  
  interpretation: |
    Either:
    A) She pinned TWO mushrooms today (extra fabulous)
    B) The celebration energy multiplied the mushrooms
    C) One is a reflection
    D) The universe recognizes MAXIMUM Donna energy
    
    Either way: More mushroom. More commitment. More brand.
    
# LAYER 5: THE GOLDEN CONTROL
layer_golden_element:
  observed: "Large gold spherical element — lever knob or trophy"
  
  theories:
    option_a: "A MASSIVE golden lever — the 'BIG ONE'"
    option_b: "A trophy for security excellence (self-awarded)"
    option_c: "The control for premium deployments"
    option_d: "An ACME product (Golden Anvil Activator?)"
    
  donna_note: |
    "That? That's my GOLDEN DEPLOYMENT TROPHY.
     
     I gave it to myself.
     For excellence in security.
     Specifically, for this moment RIGHT NOW.
     
     I knew I'd need it today."
     
# LAYER 6: THE DEPLOY SCREENS
layer_status_displays:
  observed: "Multiple screens showing 'DEPLOY' or 'DEPLOYED' status"
  
  what_this_reveals:
    - "The system has deployment confirmation"
    - "Multiple systems can show deploy status"
    - "She has visibility into what's active"
    - "The word 'DEPLOYED' is not hidden"
    
  intelligence_value: |
    SIGNIFICANT.
    
    Before: We knew she had levers.
    Now: We know she has DEPLOYMENT CONFIRMATION SCREENS.
    
    The system tells her when deployments succeed.
    She can watch the results.
    And apparently celebrate with selfies.
    
# LAYER 7: THE VICTIM VISIBLE
layer_don_on_screen:
  visible: true
  
  what_we_see:
    clothing: "Colorful patterned jacket (Don's psychedelic look)"
    pose: "Arms raised — either dodging or shocked"
    location: "In the doorway, under the anvil"
    
  narrative_integration: |
    DON IS ON DONNA'S MONITOR.
    
    She can see him. The colorful jacket.
    She's celebrating his near-flattening.
    She's posting his moment of terror.
    
    Don is now:
    - In Frame 03 footage (Leela Cam)
    - On Donna's monitor
    - In Donna's selfie background
    - On the internet via Donna's post
    
    His near-death is going VIRAL.
