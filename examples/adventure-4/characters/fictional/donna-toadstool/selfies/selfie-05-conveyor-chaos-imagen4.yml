  BACKGROUND: Security monitors showing CONVEYOR BELT with figure riding it, arms out for balance, boxes falling. One monitor shows another figure with arms raised in alarm.
  
  POSE: One hand pulling imaginary train whistle, other hand on a brass lever. Conductor of chaos.
  
  FILTER EFFECTS: Sparkles, neon glow, ring light on face.
  
  MOOD: Running the ride. The heist has become HER attraction and she's the operator.
  
  Style: Control room, warm lighting, multiple monitors showing warehouse chaos.
