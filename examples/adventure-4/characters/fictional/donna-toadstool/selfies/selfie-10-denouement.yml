#
# This is different from her other selfies.

    Richard just told her she's "weather."
    Not evil. Necessary. Part of the system.
    
    Achievers need opposition.
    Explorers need danger.
    The world needs storms.
    
    For the first time tonight — maybe ever —
    someone looked at what she does
    and didn't flinch.
    
    He understood.
    Not approved. UNDERSTOOD.
    
    The difference matters.

    All night I've been performing.
    Content creator. Chaos conductor.
    Mushroom Queen. 34 Counts of Fabulous.
    
    And it IS me. All of it.
    The levers. The nicknames. The selfies.
    
    But there's also... this.
    
    Sitting in a pub with a rabbit,
    a professor who got eaten by a wall,
    and some guy who started all of this.
    
    And nobody's afraid of me.
    
    The professor looked at me and saw... weather.
    Something that happens. Something that's SUPPOSED to happen.
    
    I don't know how to feel about that.
    But I think I feel... okay?
    
    Maybe "seen" is different from "liked."
    Maybe that's enough.
    
  visual_context:
    glasses: "OFF — pushed up on forehead or on table"
    expression: "Genuine. Soft. A little uncertain. Real."
    pose: "Not performing. Just... being."
    background: "Pub warmth, friends (?) nearby, fire glow"
    filter: "None. This one is unfiltered."
    
  what_makes_this_different: |
    Every other selfie tonight was CONTENT.
    Triumph. Victory. "Look what I did!"
    
    This one is private.
    She takes it, looks at it, doesn't post it.
    
    It's for her.
    
    Evidence that someone, once,
    saw the storms and didn't run.
    
    "Weather. I can live with weather."

    DENOUEMENT: The resolution of the dramatic tension.
    
    Donna's arc tonight:
    1. Detection excitement ("LOOK WHAT I'VE FOUND!")
    2. Active participation ("I DID THAT!")
    3. Vindication ("I TOLD YOU!")
    4. Triumph (chef's kiss, victory poses)
    5. Transcendence ("This is fine")
    6. RESOLUTION: Being seen. Being understood.
    
    She started the night as chaos conductor.
    She ends it as... weather.
    
    Something natural. Something necessary.
    Something that doesn't have to apologize.
