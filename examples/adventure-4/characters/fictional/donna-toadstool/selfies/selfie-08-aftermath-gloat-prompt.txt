EXPRESSION: VICTORY POSE — double peace signs or hands raised in triumph. SMUG satisfaction. "I won" energy. Huge grin.

BACKGROUND: Security monitors showing FIRE and CHAOS — building burning, smoke, figures outside. The control room possibly has smoke or emergency lights.

POSE: Victory stance — peace signs, thumbs up, or "I'm #1" gesture. Maximum gloat energy.

FILTER EFFECTS: Sparkles, celebration, possibly fire reflections.

MOOD: TOTAL VICTORY. Mission accomplished. Best night ever. Also maybe should evacuate but first: content.

Style: Control room in slight chaos, monitors showing the burning building, Donna completely unbothered and triumphant.
