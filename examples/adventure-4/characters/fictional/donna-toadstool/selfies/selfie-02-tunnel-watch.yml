    👀 FANCY PANTS IS STARING AT MY TUNNEL 👀
    
    Look at him! LOOK! He KNOWS something's wrong!
    
    The tunnel has that effect on SMART ones.
    They can FEEL it watching them back.
    
    His friend is pointing at the building like it's CHRISTMAS.
    But Pattern Boy? He's frozen. MESMERIZED.
    
    The tunnel does that. The tunnel KNOWS.
    
    Spoiler: It's not a real tunnel! HA! 
    (For them. It's real for ME.)

    DONNA'S POSE:
    - Finger to lips in "shh" gesture, or pointing at monitor
    - Expression: KNOWING, conspiratorial
    - One eye squinted — the "I see what you're doing" look
    
    THE MONITOR (key shot):
    - Shows them AT THE BUILDING
    - Don clearly LOOKING at the tunnel
    - The tunnel visible, hypnotic spiral
    - Instigator gesturing at door
    
    BACKGROUND:
    - Other monitors showing various angles
    - Maybe a "TUNNEL EFFECTIVENESS" readout?
    - The lever console, brass gleaming
    - General control room chaos/organization
    
  opsec_violations:
    - "Tunnel effectiveness metrics visible"
    - "The fact that she knows it's not real (for them)"
    - "Confirmation that the tunnel 'watches back'"
    - "Monitor showing exact intruder positions"
