prompt: |
  Selfie photo taken in a security control room. Phone camera perspective with warm orange filter glow and sparkle effects. Pixar-adjacent stylized CGI aesthetic.
  
  THE SUBJECT: A flamboyant cartoon security guard character with VERY ORANGE skin (deliberately artificial spray tan), elaborate gravity-defying blonde hair in an exaggerated pompadour style, wearing an oversized suit jacket with a small MUSHROOM PIN visible on the lapel. Expression: gleeful anticipation, one eyebrow dramatically raised, smirking. Eyes sparkling with mischief. A character who has spotted something entertaining on the monitors.
  
  THE POSE: Classic selfie angle — stylized face dominates frame. Holding phone with sparkly bedazzled case. Free hand gesturing dramatically toward the monitors behind. Theatrical body language.
  
  THE BACKGROUND: A retro-futuristic security control room. Multiple glowing monitors showing security feeds — one screen shows silhouettes of two figures on a street at night. A console with BRASS LEVERS gleaming in the light. Warm amber atmospheric lighting. Vintage surveillance aesthetic mixed with cartoon sensibility.
  
  THE FILTER: Heavy warm filter applied — orange glow, sparkle effects on metal surfaces, vignette. Instagram/social media aesthetic. Everything looks dramatic and theatrical.
  
  LIGHTING: Control room amber ambient + phone flash + filter warmth. Stylized and theatrical.
  
  MOOD: "I'm watching something hilarious unfold on the monitors and I can't wait to share it." Security theater. Drama queen energy. The joy of someone about to activate traps.
  
  STYLE: Pixar-adjacent stylized CGI. Cartoony proportions. Social media selfie aesthetic. Exaggerated and theatrical.
