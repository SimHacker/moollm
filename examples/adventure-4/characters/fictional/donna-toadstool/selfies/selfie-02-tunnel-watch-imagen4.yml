  Selfie photo in a security control room. Phone camera perspective with warm orange filter and sparkle effects. Pixar-adjacent stylized CGI.
  
  THE SUBJECT: Same flamboyant cartoon security character — ORANGE skin, elaborate blonde pompadour hair, oversized suit with mushroom pin. Expression: KNOWING, conspiratorial — finger to lips in a "shh" gesture OR one eye squinted in a "I see you" look. The smirk of someone watching prey approach a trap.
  
  THE POSE: Selfie angle but more theatrical — maybe leaning toward the monitor pointing at something on screen. The energy of "watch THIS."
  
  THE KEY MONITOR: Behind the character, one monitor prominently shows TWO FIGURES standing in front of a building with a BLACK AND WHITE SPIRAL TUNNEL painted on the facade. One figure is gesturing, one is staring at the tunnel.
  
  BACKGROUND: Multiple glowing monitors. Control room amber lighting. One display might show "TUNNEL STATUS" or similar text. Brass levers visible, sparkling. The aesthetic of vintage surveillance meets cartoon villainy.
  
  THE FILTER: Heavy orange glow, sparkle on metals, vignette. Social media ready.
  
  LIGHTING: Warm amber control room + filter enhancement. Dramatic and theatrical.
  
  MOOD: "They don't know what they're walking into, but I DO." Conspirator energy. The delight of watching someone fall for a trap in slow motion.
  
  STYLE: Pixar-adjacent CGI. Cartoony. Social media selfie aesthetic. Theatrical villain vibes.
