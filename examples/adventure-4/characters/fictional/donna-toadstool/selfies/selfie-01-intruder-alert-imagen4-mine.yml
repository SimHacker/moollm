    Every OPSEC violation, every leaked floor plan,
    every selfie that reveals control room secrets —
    all through this bedazzled rectangle of consequences.
    
    It sparkles. It documents. It posts.

    This monitor shows EXACTLY what Frame 01 captured!
    
    The Leela Cam (ACM1) caught them from outside.
    Donna's monitor is catching them from HER system.
    And Donna is posting her monitor to social media.
    
    Surveillance layers:
    1. Leela Cam → Frame 01 footage
    2. ACME internal → Donna's monitor
    3. Donna's selfie → Her followers
    4. Us watching Donna watching the intruders
    
    It's surveillance all the way down.
    
# LAYER 5: THE SELF-CAPTIONING
layer_emergent_text:
  the_caption: "LOOK WHAT I'VE FOUND!"
  
  interpretation: |
    The image generator gave Donna her own headline.
    
    This is either:
    A) A marquee display in her control room (she has one)
    B) Her filter automatically adding hype text
    C) The universe recognizing peak Donna energy
    D) All of the above
    
    Either way: YES AND. This is canon now.
    Donna has a "LOOK WHAT I'VE FOUND!" display.
    It activates automatically when she finds something.
    
  donna_justification: |
    "The display? Oh that's AUTOMATIC.
     
     When the system detects my EXCITEMENT LEVELS spike,
     it puts up an appropriate headline.
     
     'LOOK WHAT I'VE FOUND!' for discoveries.
     'DEPLOYING!' for lever pulls.
     'TREMENDOUS!' for everything else.
     
     It's called BRANDING, sweetie."

# LAYER 7: NARRATIVE INTEGRATION
layer_narrative:
  timeline_position: |
    23:07:45 — Donna posts Selfie 01
    
    This is DURING Frame 01:
    - Frame 01 Take 1 (glitch): 23:07:42
    - Frame 01 Take 2 (clear): 23:07:43
    - Donna's Selfie: 23:07:45
    
    She was watching LIVE. She posted within seconds.
    The content instinct is STRONG.
    
  what_it_reveals:
    - "Donna has been watching since they appeared on the street"
    - "She reacted IMMEDIATELY to intruder detection"
    - "She prioritizes selfies over security response"
    - "Her control room has mood-responsive displays"
    - "The intruders don't know they're being documented TWICE"
    
  context_for_next_selfie: |
    Selfie 02 should sync with Frame 02 (the invitation).
    
    By then:
    - They're at the building
    - The tunnel is hypnotizing Don
    - Donna is watching them hesitate
    
    Caption prediction: Something about the tunnel, or Fancy Pants.
