      "What? It's just a SELFIE! Very GLAMOROUS! 
       
       What do you MEAN you can see the levers?
       What do you MEAN you can count the monitors?
       What do you MEAN line 23 is BLINKING?
       
       ...
       
       I look TREMENDOUS though. Best lighting. Many likes.
       
       ...
       
       Maybe I should delete it.

    "FINE. I deleted it. HAPPY?
     
     But you know what? 847 likes. 234 shares.
     That's called ENGAGEMENT.
     
     The algorithm LOVED it. The people LOVED it.
     
     And NOBODY is going to find this basement just because
     they can see the GPS coordinates and the entrance location
     and the monitor layout and the trap controls and—
     
     ...
     
     I should change the lever colors, shouldn't I."
