    No caption. No pose. No performance.
    Just... her. Thinking. Being.

layer_visual:
  donna:
    expression: "CONTEMPLATIVE — not performing"
    eyes: "Looking slightly off-camera, thinking"
    mouth: "Neutral, soft, not smiling FOR the camera"
    pose: "Hands folded, still, quiet"
    
  outfit_change:
    previous: "Navy suit, red tie, mushroom pins"
    now: "Olive cardigan over cream top"
    significance: "The armor is off. The costume is gone."
    
  glasses:
    status: "Still pink heart-shaped"
    but: "The expression behind them is different"
    note: "The glasses aren't the performance. She was."
    
  background:
    rabbit_ears: "Visible — Don is there, part of the scene"
    fireplace: "Warm glow, crackling"
    other_figures: "Blurred — the fellowship exists"
    
layer_the_moment:
  richard_said: |
    "You're not evil. You're weather.
     Weather doesn't apologize for storms."
     
  donna_heard: |
    Permission.
    Not approval — PERMISSION.
    
    To be what she is.
    Without apology.
    Without performance.
    Without content.
    
    Just... storms when there need to be storms.
    
  what_it_means: |
    All night she's been the Mushroom Queen.
    Content creator. Chaos conductor.
    34 Counts of Fabulous.
    
    But Richard — the game designer,
    the one who got eaten by a wall,
    the one who should be ANGRY —
    
    He looked at her and saw something natural.
    Something that's supposed to exist.
    Part of the ecosystem.
    
    "Weather."
    
    She can live with weather.

  definition: |
    DENOUEMENT (n.): The final outcome of the main dramatic
    complication in a literary work; the resolution.
    
  donna_arc:
    inciting_incident: "Intruders detected"
    rising_action: "Traps deployed, documentation ongoing"
    climax: "Building on fire, THWACK achieved"
    falling_action: "Pub gathering, unlikely fellowship"
    resolution: "Being seen. Being understood. 'Weather.'"
    
  the_change: |
    She doesn't BECOME different.
    She ACCEPTS what she already was.
    
    The selfie isn't evidence of transformation.
    It's evidence of recognition.
    
    Someone saw the storms and stayed.
    
layer_why_she_doesnt_post:
  reasons:
    - "This isn't content. This is real."
    - "Some moments are private."
    - "The followers wouldn't understand."
    - "Richard might see it and that would be... complicated."
    - "She wants to keep this one for herself."
    
  what_she_does: |
    She saves it.
    Looks at it sometimes.
    When she needs to remember:
    
    "Weather. I can live with weather."
    
    It's enough.

  the_gift_richard_gave: |
    He didn't forgive her.
    He didn't approve.
    He UNDERSTOOD.
    
    The taxonomy doesn't judge.
    Killers aren't evil.
    They're necessary.
    
    Donna isn't a villain.
    She's weather.
    
    And weather is what makes the world MOVE.
