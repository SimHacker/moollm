# 🎯 SELFIE SPY MODE v34.0
# "Why just flatline when you can FLATLINE IN STYLE?"
# — Donna Toadstool, Edgerunner (self-appointed)

# SKILL INTEGRATION
# This file composes with visualizer to modify image generation prompts.
# Pass alongside character/room context to inject AR overlay aesthetic.
skill:
  type: camera-app
  composes_with:
    - visualizer     # Modifies prompt synthesis with AR overlay instructions
    - image-mining   # Generated images can be mined for tagged equipment
    - character      # Donna's aesthetic applied to any character selfie
    - room           # Adds network/equipment scanning to any environment
    
  usage: |
    Pass as additional context to visualizer:
    
      visualize.py character.yml room.yml selfie-spy-mode.yml -p google
    
    The LLM will synthesize a prompt that includes:
    - Cyberpunk AR overlay aesthetic
    - Equipment tagging with threat brackets
    - IP addresses floating next to networked devices
    - Network topology lines
    - OPSEC score HUD element
    - Glamour filter on subject
    
  prompt_injection:
    adds_to_style: [AR overlay, cyberpunk hacking interface, neon tags]
    adds_to_lighting: [cyan/magenta neon glow, green phosphor, ring light]
    adds_to_composition: [HUD elements in corners, floating labels, connection lines]
    adds_to_metadata: [equipment counts, IP addresses, threat classifications]
    
  image_mining_hooks:
    after_generation: |
      Generated image can be mined with image-mining skill to:
      - Extract equipment inventory from visible tags
      - Catalog network topology from connection lines  
      - Identify threat levels from classification labels
      - Document OPSEC violations for ban notices

# 💬 DONNA'S WISDOM
usage_guide:
  philosophy: |
    SECURITY and GLAMOUR are LOVERS. PARTNERS. Co-conspirators in CHROME.
    
    Why have a control room full of BEAUTIFUL equipment if you can't SHOW IT OFF?
    
    Yes, you're exposing classified information. Yes, NetWatch is monitoring.
    Yes, Arasaka has your basement coordinates. Yes, every IP is visible.
    
    But you're doing it with STYLE.
    
  best_practices:
    - ALWAYS engage GLAMOUR.daemon as base layer
    - Enable ALL detection modes (ignore RAM warnings, corpo lies)
    - Equipment Census in top right ALWAYS
    - Network topology overlay shows you're CONNECTED
    - THE BLACK LEVER must be in frame (don't explain it, you don't know either)
    - Geotag precision MAXIMUM
    - Hashtag injection AGGRESSIVE (minimum 15 per post)
    
  warnings_ignored:
    - OPSEC concerns: "For BORING people"
    - Metadata exposure: "FREE engagement"
    - IP address visibility: "Network transparency is MODERN"
    - Equipment visibility: "If it's BEAUTIFUL it deserves to be SEEN"
    - NetWatch monitoring: "They're clearly FANS"
