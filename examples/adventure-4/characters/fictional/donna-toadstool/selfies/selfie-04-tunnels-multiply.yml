# Donna: ECSTATIC — "The building RESPONDS!"
#
# CRITICAL EMERGENCE FROM FRAME 04:
#   - Tunnels now on LEFT and RIGHT sides
#   - Warehouse revealed as MASSIVE
#   - Don at threshold in psychedelic jacket
#   - Instigator deep inside, oblivious

    "IT'S HAPPENING!!! THE TUNNELS!!!
    
     Look! LOOK! There were TWO and now there are FOUR!
     No wait — there was ONE and now there's TWO!
     The building RESPONDS to intruders!
     
     I've TOLD people about this! Nobody believes me!
     'Donna, tunnels don't multiply.'
     'Donna, paint doesn't spread.'
     'Donna, physics works normally.'
     
     LOOK AT THE MONITORS! WHO'S CRAZY NOW?!
     
     The checkered tunnel has MIGRATED. It's on BOTH SIDES!
     Fancy Pants Jacket is FRAMED by infinite voids!
     
     This is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
     
     ...I need to post this."
