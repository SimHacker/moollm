Abstract Pixar-adjacent stylized CGI with Scott McCloud masking aesthetic — simplified features, warm shapes, emotion through abstraction.

INTIMATE PUB SELFIE. Orange-skinned character with blonde pompadour, but DIFFERENT from before:
- Pink heart glasses PUSHED UP on forehead or set aside on table
- Expression: GENUINE, SOFT, slightly uncertain — a real smile, not a performance
- Eyes visible without glasses — slightly vulnerable
- Pose: Not performing. Just being. Quiet moment.

BACKGROUND: Warm pub interior, out of focus. Amber glow. Shapes of friends at the table — a rabbit ear visible, the curve of a cardigan. Firelight.

STYLE: More abstracted than usual. Softer edges. The masking effect where simple features allow the viewer to project. This isn't content — this is a person.

MOOD: The quiet after the storm. Being seen. Being understood. Not triumph — something deeper. Resolution.

NO FILTERS. No sparkles. No victory pose. Just... her. In a moment she won't post. A moment that's real.

Lighting: Warm amber, soft, intimate. The kindest light.
