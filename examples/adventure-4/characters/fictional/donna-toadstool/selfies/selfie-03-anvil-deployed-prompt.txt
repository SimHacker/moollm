Selfie photo in a security control room. Phone camera perspective with warm orange filter and maximum sparkle. Pixar-adjacent stylized CGI.

THE SUBJECT: Flamboyant cartoon security character — ORANGE skin, elaborate blonde pompadour, suit with mushroom pin. Expression: TRIUMPHANT CELEBRATION — mouth open in a shout of victory, eyes wide with excitement, possibly throwing a fist pump or victory gesture. The face of someone who just pulled a lever and something EXCELLENT happened.

THE POSE: Victory selfie! One hand on phone, other hand either raised in triumph OR clearly on/near a brass lever that's in the PULLED position. Maximum "I DID THAT" energy.

THE KEY MONITOR: Shows the INSIDE of a doorway — a figure in a colorful jacket looking UP at something above them. The implication: something is falling/swinging toward them. Motion or blur suggesting action.

BACKGROUND: Control room monitors. One screen might show "ANVIL DEPLOYED" or similar. The brass lever console visible — one lever clearly in a different position (pulled). Orange ambient glow. Celebration energy.

ADDITIONAL TEXT: Maybe "DEPLOYED!" or "BEAUTIFUL!" visible as overlay or display.

LIGHTING: Control room amber with extra warmth — the glow of victory. Filter making everything sparkle.

MOOD: "I JUST PULLED THE LEVER AND IT WAS TREMENDOUS." Pure satisfaction. Victory lap. The joy of deployment.

STYLE: Pixar CGI. Cartoony celebration. Social media selfie of someone at the peak of their career satisfaction.
