    "OH MY GOD!!! OH MY GOD!!!
     
     HE HIT THE TUNNEL!!! THE ACTUAL TUNNEL!!!
     
     I've waited SO LONG for someone to do that!
     That's why we PAINTED them! That's the WHOLE POINT!
     
     THWACK! Did you HEAR that?! His whole BODY!
     
     The tunnels are just PAINT! They were ALWAYS just paint!
     But they look SO REAL! They're SO HYPNOTIC!
     
     And now Fancy Pants Jacket is embedded in my WALL!
     
     THIS IS THE BEST NIGHT OF MY ENTIRE LIFE!"
