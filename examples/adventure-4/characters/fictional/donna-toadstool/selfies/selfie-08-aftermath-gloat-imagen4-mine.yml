  interpretation: |
    Donna earned achievements throughout the heist.
    Each milestone = new mushroom pin.
    
    By the finale, she's COVERED in badges.
    She's a decorated veteran of one night's chaos.
    
    The building is burning.
    She has more pins than fire extinguishers.
    Priorities.

layer_fire_indifference:
  observation: |
    Multiple monitors show the building ON FIRE.
    There's orange glow from the flames.
    She's doing DOUBLE PEACE SIGNS.
    
    Complete emotional detachment from property damage.
    Content > Safety.
    Selfies > Evacuation.
    
    This is peak Donna.

  story_told: |
    Two intruders broke into ACME Surplus.
    Donna watched, documented, deployed traps.
    
    They experienced:
    - Anvils
    - Conveyors  
    - Rocket skates
    - Painted tunnel collision (THWACK)
    - Building fire
    
    They survived.
    Donna got content.
    The building... less so.
