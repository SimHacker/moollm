# HEISENBERGIAN GENDER FLUIDITY

gender_rendering_note: |
  Across 11 renders, Donna appears with significant variation:
  
  - OPSEC disaster: Masculine authority, combover emphasis
  - Triumph selfies: Power poses, claiming space
  - Pink glasses era: Femme sparkle on masc frame
  - Chef's kiss: Gesture softening the suit
  - Home Alone: Vulnerability emerging
  - "This is fine": Calm amid masculine framing
  - Denouement: Cardigan softness, genuine expression
  
  This variation is COHERENT DRAG PERFORMANCE.
  Each render = one configuration of the quantum drag king.
  All are canonical. All are Donna.
  
  See: GENDER-FLUIDITY-REFLECTION.md

# HOW TO USE THIS CONTEXT

usage_note: |
  When generating Donna-related content:
  
  1. Check current accessory state (glasses, pins, outfit)
  2. Reference her emotional arc position
  3. Note the self-captioning pattern (early: text, late: visual)
  4. Allow gender presentation to vary (it's intentional)
  5. Build on established OPSEC violation patterns
  
  The mines are CHARACTER MEMORY — use for coherence.
