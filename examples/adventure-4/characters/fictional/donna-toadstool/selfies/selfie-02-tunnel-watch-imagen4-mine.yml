# Donna's Selfie 02 Mining — "WATCH THIS!"
#
# THE TUNNEL HAS A STATUS. THE STATUS IS "ACTIVE."
# This selfie just revealed operational intelligence about the tunnel system.
#
# OPSEC violations escalating. Donna doesn't care.

# LAYER 1: THE TUNNEL STATUS REVELATION
layer_opsec_disaster:
  what_donna_just_revealed:
    monitor_readout: "TUNNEL STATUS: ACTIVE"
    
  implications:
    - "The tunnel has an operational STATUS"
    - "It can be ACTIVE or presumably INACTIVE"
    - "She has a MONITOR dedicated to tunnel status"
    - "The tunnel is part of a SYSTEM she controls"
    - "This is now publicly documented"
    
  intelligence_value: |
    SIGNIFICANT.
    
    Before this selfie, observers might have thought the tunnel
    was just painted decoration — a passive optical illusion.
    
    Now we know:
    - It's part of an ACTIVE SYSTEM
    - It has multiple states (ACTIVE implies INACTIVE exists)
    - Donna monitors its status in real-time
    - The tunnel isn't just paint — it's INFRASTRUCTURE
    
    The "Chekhov's Tunnel" just got more dangerous.
    It's not just a thing someone will bounce off.
    It's a thing that can be ACTIVATED.
    
# LAYER 2: THE MONITOR SHOWING THE SCENE
layer_tunnel_monitor:
  what_it_shows:
    tunnel: "Perfect black-and-white spiral, hypnotic depth"
    figures: "TWO PEOPLE standing in front of it"
    building: "The ACME Surplus facade"
    composition: "Exactly matches Frame 02!"
    
  narrative_sync: |
    Donna's monitor shows the SAME MOMENT as Frame 02.
    
    The surveillance layers continue:
    - Leela Cam (outside) → Frame 02
    - Donna's system (inside) → This monitor
    - Donna's selfie → Her followers
    - Us watching the recursion
    
    Both cameras captured the same moment.
    Donna is POSTING her view of the moment.
    
# LAYER 3: THE BRASS LEVERS
layer_controls:
  visible: "THREE BRASS LEVERS at bottom of frame"
  condition: "Sparkling (filter effect + actual polish)"
  
  what_this_reveals:
    - "The lever console is WITHIN REACH during selfies"
    - "She can post AND deploy simultaneously"
    - "The levers look USED — smooth with wear"
    - "This is an active control station, not display"
    
  donna_note: |
    "The levers are FINE! They're not even LABELED!
     
     ...In this photo.
     
     The labels are on the OTHER side.
     
     SEE? OPSEC!"
     
# LAYER 4: THE "WATCH THIS" ENERGY
layer_caption:
  text: "WATCH THIS!"
  
  meaning: |
    This is the caption of someone about to demonstrate something.
    
    In context: She's saying "WATCH THIS!" to her followers,
    directing their attention to what's about to happen
    to the figures approaching the tunnel.
    
    She KNOWS what's coming.
    She's INVITING viewers to see it.
    
    This is the energy of:
    - A magic trick about to be revealed
    - A trap about to spring
    - A villain explaining the plan mid-plan
    
  donna_justification: |
    "My followers DESERVE to see this!
     
     Do you know how RARE it is to catch someone
     MESMERIZED by the tunnel in real time?
     
     That Pattern Boy is FROZEN.
     His friend doesn't even NOTICE.
     
     This is PREMIUM CONTENT!"
     
# LAYER 5: DONNA'S EXPRESSION
layer_donna:
  expression: "THE SMIRK"
  
  analysis:
    eyes: "Squinted slightly — knowing, predatory"
    mouth: "Smirk — one corner up, self-satisfied"
    eyebrow: "One raised — the classic 'I know something' look"
    overall: "Villain energy. Conspirator face. DELIGHTED malice."
    
  what_she_knows: |
    Donna KNOWS:
    - The tunnel is active
    - Pattern Boy (Don) is mesmerized
    - His friend is oblivious
    - They're about to try the door
    - The door has the ANVIL
    - Everything after that is levers and screaming
    
    And she's POINTING at the screen like a gameshow host
    showing off what's behind door number one.

# LAYER 7: NARRATIVE INTEGRATION

  timeline: |
    23:08:20 — Donna posts Selfie 02
    
    This syncs with Frame 02 (invitation).
    The figures are AT the building.
    Don is staring at the tunnel.
    The instigator is gesturing.
    
    Next: They'll try the door.
    Next: The anvil will drop.
    Next: Donna will post THAT too.
    
  chekhov_update: |
    CHEKHOV'S TUNNEL just became CHEKHOV'S ACTIVE TUNNEL.
    
    It's not just a gun on the wall.
    It's a gun on the wall with an ammunition counter visible.
    And Donna just showed the counter to the internet.
