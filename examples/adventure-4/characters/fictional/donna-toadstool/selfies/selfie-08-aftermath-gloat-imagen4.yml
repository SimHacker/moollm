prompt: |
  Pixar-adjacent stylized CGI selfie. Flamboyant cartoon security guard character with ORANGE skin, elaborate blonde pompadour, rotund body in navy suit with red tie, MULTIPLE MUSHROOM PINS on lapel, PINK HEART-SHAPED GLASSES.
  
  EXPRESSION: VICTORY POSE — double peace signs or hands raised in triumph. SMUG satisfaction. "I won" energy. Huge grin.
  
  BACKGROUND: Security monitors showing FIRE and CHAOS — building burning, smoke, figures outside. The control room possibly has smoke or emergency lights.
  
  POSE: Victory stance — peace signs, thumbs up, or "I'm #1" gesture. Maximum gloat energy.
  
  FILTER EFFECTS: Sparkles, celebration, possibly fire reflections.
  
  MOOD: TOTAL VICTORY. Mission accomplished. Best night ever. Also maybe should evacuate but first: content.
  
  Style: Control room in slight chaos, monitors showing the burning building, Donna completely unbothered and triumphant.
