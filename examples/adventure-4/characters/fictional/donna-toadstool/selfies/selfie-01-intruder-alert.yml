    🚨 INTRUDER ALERT 🚨
    
    Two subjects approaching ACME Surplus!
    This is NOT a drill, people!
    
    Look at my FACE! Look at my READINESS!
    This is what a PROFESSIONAL looks like
    when she detects UNAUTHORIZED PERSONNEL!
    
    The one in front is POINTING at my building!
    The one in the pattern shirt... nice shirt, WRONG CHOICE!
    
    Stay tuned for UPDATES! This is going to be TREMENDOUS!

    "The lever console is FINE! It's basically just DECORATIVE!
     
     ...Mostly decorative.
     
     The important thing is I look TREMENDOUS
