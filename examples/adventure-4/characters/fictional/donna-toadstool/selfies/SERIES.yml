    "If it's BEAUTIFUL it deserves to be SEEN.
     If it's CLASSIFIED it's probably INTERESTING.
     If it's INTERESTING it gets MORE ENGAGEMENT.
     
     OPSEC? That's for people with BORING content."

# PARALLEL TIMELINE — THE HEIST FOOTAGE
#
# The Leela Cam (ACM1) is capturing the SAME events from across the street.
# That footage belongs to the LOCATION (ACME Surplus heist-footage/).
# Donna's selfies sync with those frames but SHE owns these.
#
# INTERLEAVE for storytelling:
#   External view (heist) → Internal view (selfie) → External → Internal...
#
# Two timelines. Two owners. Same disaster.

  location: "../../../../street/lane-neverending/leela-manufacturing/lobby/acme-heist-footage/"
  
  relationship: |
    The heist footage is OBJECTIVE — what the camera sees from outside.
    Donna's selfies are SUBJECTIVE — her POV, her joy, her filters.
    
    The heist footage shows what HAPPENS.
    Donna's selfies show how she FEELS about it.
    
    Together they create NARRATIVE PARALLAX.
