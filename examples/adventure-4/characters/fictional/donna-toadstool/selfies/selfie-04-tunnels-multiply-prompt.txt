Pixar-adjacent stylized CGI selfie. Flamboyant cartoon security guard character with ORANGE skin, elaborate blonde pompadour, rotund body in navy suit with red tie, MUSHROOM PIN on lapel.

EXPRESSION: WILD ECSTATIC JOY — mouth wide open in amazement, eyes huge, pointing with BOTH hands at different monitors behind her.

BACKGROUND: Security control room with multiple monitors. TWO monitors prominently showing BLACK AND WHITE CHECKERED PERSPECTIVE TUNNELS — one on each side. The tunnels appear identical, infinite, hypnotic. Other monitors show warehouse interior.

POSE: Both arms extended, pointing at the tunnel monitors on opposite sides. "Look at BOTH of them!" energy.

FILTER EFFECTS: Sparkle particles, neon glow edges, ring light on face.

MOOD: Vindicated triumph — "I TOLD you the tunnels multiply!" Pure joy at impossible physics being documented.

Style: Security camera control room, warm amber lighting mixed with monitor glow, bedazzled phone visible.
