    "CHOO CHOO! ALL ABOARD THE ACME EXPRESS!
     
     Next stop: AISLE 7! Spring shoes! Testing in progress!
     
     Look at him SURF those boxes! Arms out! 
     Does he think that helps?! IT DOESN'T HELP!
     
     And FANCY PANTS at the door — arms up!
     'What's happening?!' face! I LOVE that face!
     
     The best part? The tunnels went ORANGE.
     They KNOW. The building KNOWS.
     
     Things are about to get VERY interesting."
