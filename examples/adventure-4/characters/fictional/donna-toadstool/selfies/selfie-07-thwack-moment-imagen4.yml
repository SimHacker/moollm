prompt: |
  Pixar-adjacent stylized CGI selfie. Flamboyant cartoon security guard character with ORANGE skin, elaborate blonde pompadour, rotund body in navy suit with red tie, MUSHROOM PINS on lapel, PINK HEART-SHAPED GLASSES (possibly askew).
  
  EXPRESSION: HOME ALONE FACE — hands on both cheeks, mouth WIDE OPEN in shocked amazement. Classic Macaulay Culkin pose. Cannot believe what she just witnessed.
  
  BACKGROUND: Security monitor showing a figure SPLAYED against a painted tunnel wall. Impact stars visible.
  
  POSE: Both hands on cheeks, pushing face into shocked expression. "OH MY GOD!" energy.
  
  FILTER EFFECTS: Sparkles, dramatic lighting, impact effects.
  
  MOOD: Disbelief and joy combined. Someone finally hit the tunnel. Dreams coming true.
  
  Style: Control room, monitor showing the THWACK moment, pure cartoon shock reaction.
