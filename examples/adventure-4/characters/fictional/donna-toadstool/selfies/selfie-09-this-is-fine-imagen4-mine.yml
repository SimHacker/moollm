  interpretation: |
    EVERYTHING is on fire or being consumed.
    A person is being eaten by a portal.
    A man has fully transformed into a rabbit.
    Buildings are burning.
    
    Donna is sipping coffee.
    
    THIS IS FINE.

  donna_version: |
    Security guard sitting in control room
    watching portal consumption, rabbit transformation, and fire
    saying (implicitly): "This is fine."
    
    The meme has been PERFECTED.
    
    She has SEEN EVERYTHING tonight:
    - Anvils
    - Conveyors
    - Rocket skates
    - THWACK moments
    - Tunnel multiplication
    - Building fire
    - Academic abduction
    - Full species transformation
    
    And she's FINE.
    She's sipping COFFEE.
    She has achieved COMPLETE EQUANIMITY.

  observation: "The rabbit on the monitor looks HAPPY"
  
  interpretation: |
    Rabbit-Don appears content in the monitor.
    
    Maybe being a rabbit isn't so bad?
    Maybe he's accepted his new form?
    Maybe rabbits are just naturally cheerful?
    
    Either way, he's TIE-DYE and RABBIT
    and apparently OKAY with it now.

  narrative_complete: |
    Two parallel timelines.
    Multiple character transformations.
    Cross-session continuity (Bunny Backfire).
    Academic irony achieved.
    
    And through it all:
    Donna. Coffee. Pink glasses.
    
    "This is fine."
