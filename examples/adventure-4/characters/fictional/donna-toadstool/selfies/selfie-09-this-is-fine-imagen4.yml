prompt: |
  Pixar-adjacent stylized CGI selfie. Flamboyant cartoon security guard character with ORANGE skin, elaborate blonde pompadour, rotund body in navy suit with red tie, MANY MUSHROOM PINS on lapel, PINK HEART-SHAPED GLASSES.
  
  EXPRESSION: "THIS IS FINE" MEME ENERGY — calm, unbothered smile while DRINKING COFFEE from a mug. Completely relaxed posture despite chaos.
  
  BACKGROUND: Security monitors showing ABSOLUTE CHAOS:
  - One monitor: Figure being PULLED INTO a swirling blue vortex/tunnel
  - One monitor: A RABBIT in tie-dye hoodie
  - One monitor: Building on FIRE
  - Everything is on fire and crazy but she's FINE
  
  POSE: Casually sipping coffee, one hand on mug, relaxed posture. "Just another day at the office" energy.
  
  MOOD: Complete calm amid apocalyptic chaos. The "this is fine" dog meme but as Donna.
  
  Style: Control room, fire reflections, monitors showing disaster, Donna COMPLETELY UNBOTHERED.
