  CYBERPUNK AR OVERLAY SELFIE in a retro-futuristic control room. Pixar-adjacent stylized CGI with neon holographic UI elements.
  
  SUBJECT: Flamboyant cartoon character with VERY ORANGE skin (spray tan), elaborate gravity-defying blonde pompadour, rotund body in ill-fitting navy suit straining at buttons, RED TIE too long, MUSHROOM PIN on lapel. Expression: SMUG duck-lips selfie pose, peace sign, bedazzled phone visible. Oblivious to what's behind her.
  
  AR OVERLAY EFFECTS: Neon CYAN and MAGENTA holographic brackets tagging equipment. Floating IP ADDRESSES in glowing text. Network lines connecting devices. Corner HUD showing "OPSEC: 100%" and equipment counts. Glitch artifacts and scan lines.
  
  BACKGROUND: Wall of 40+ surveillance monitors (green phosphor glow), one showing STATIC. BRASS LEVER CONSOLE with rows of colored levers (red, blue, yellow, green) and one BLACK LEVER under glass. REEL-TO-REEL tape recorders with tapes spinning. VACUUM TUBES glowing orange. SWITCHBOARD with blinking lights. POST-IT NOTES with handwritten nicknames. The THRONE chair she sits in.
  
  LIGHTING: Ring light on face, cyan/magenta AR glow, green phosphor from monitors, orange from vacuum tubes.
  
  MOOD: Maximum OPSEC violation selfie. She thinks she looks fabulous. Everything classified is visible and AR-tagged. The selfie that got her banned.
