    She's not just watching — she's DRIVING.
    
    Hand on lever. Eyes on monitors.
    The mandatory tour is HER ride.
    She built it. She runs it. She loves it.
    
  continuity_note: |
    The pink glasses from Selfie 04 persist.
    
    She said she'd keep them on for the rest of the night.
    She meant it.
