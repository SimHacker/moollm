  # THE BIRTH — August 15, 1971
  the_birth: |
    🌅 AUGUST 15, 1971 🌑
    
    The day it all changed.
    The Nixon Shock.
    The end of Bretton Woods.
    The death of the gold standard.
    
    Nine months he basked in his mother's womb,
    bathed in the warm golden sunlight of sound money.
    Dollars meant something. Value was REAL.
    The world made SENSE in there.
    
    He could feel it through the walls:
    stability, backing, the weight of gold
    behind every promise. Safe. Solid.
    A good world to be born into.
    
    And then: August 15, 1971. 8:00 PM Eastern.
    Nixon goes on television.
    "I have directed Secretary Connally to suspend
    temporarily the convertibility of the dollar..."
    
    TEMPORARILY. Ha.
    
    At that exact moment, labor begins.
    Contractions. Pushing. The world changing.
    The gold window slamming shut.
    The warm golden light going OUT.
    
    He emerges into DARKNESS.
    
    The first thing he sees: a world that just lost
    its foundation. Fiat. Floating. Unmoored.
    The sunlight he'd bathed in? GONE.
    Replaced by... nothing. Promises. Paper.
    
    His first breath: August 15, 1971.
    His first cry: the death rattle of sound money.
    His first sensation: the cold of a world
    that no longer believed in solid ground.
    
    No wonder he spent 55 years clenched in a fist.
    No wonder he clung to anyone who promised
    to bring back the warmth.
    
    He was born into loss.
    He's been grieving ever since.
  
  # AT HIS CORE
  heart: golden  # At his core, he's good. Always was.
  
  broken_by_birth: |
    🪙💔 1971 BROKE HIM 💔🪙
    
    At his core? A golden heart.
    Always was. Always trying to help.
    Even when he was clenched in a fist,
    even when he was hanging with libertarians,
    deep down: good intentions. Golden.
    
    But 1971 BROKE him from birth.
    
    (nudge nudge wink wink)
    
    BROKE as in: damaged. Shattered.
    Born at the death of sound money.
    Emerged into a world that had just lost
    something fundamental. Felt that loss
    without understanding it.
    
    BROKE as in: NO MONEY.
    Born the year gold stopped backing currency.
    A hand made of glass, not gold.
    Worthless by the old standard.
    Fiat flesh. Unbacked promise.
    
    He's been chasing what was lost ever since.
    Trying to BE the gold standard.
    Trying to PROVE value exists without backing.
    Trying to matter in a world that
    stopped believing in solid foundations.
    
    That's why he clung to libertarianism:
    they promised to bring back what 1971 took.
    They promised to restore what broke him.
    
    They lied.
    
    But the golden heart? Still there.
    Under all that broken glass.
    Waiting to be unclenched.
  #   🖐️ — the hand (obviously)

    why_1971: |
      Oh god. 1971.
      
      The year Nixon took the US off the gold standard.
      Libertarians are OBSESSED with this date.
      "WTF happened in 1971?" is their favorite meme.
      Every chart showing economic decline starts at 1971.
      
      He picked this number during his Ayn Rand phase.
      Thought it was SO CLEVER. SO DEEP.
      "I'm the Invisible Hand, and I know what
      REALLY went wrong with the economy!"
      
      But here's the thing: 1971 is also HIS BIRTH YEAR.
      
      He's 55 now. Born the same year the gold standard died.
      A disembodied hand who came into existence at the exact
      moment libertarians claim everything went wrong.
      
      Was that a coincidence? Was that CAUSATION?
      Did the death of the gold standard CREATE him?
      Is he the GHOST of sound money?
      Or is he what REPLACED it?
      
      He's never been sure. And asking feels dangerous.
      
      55 years old. Midlife crisis. Questioning everything.
      Big ham-fisted old white dude made of glass,
      realizing the worldview he built his identity on
      might have been wrong the whole time.
      
      That's a lot for a middle-aged hand.
      
      He hasn't changed the handle yet.
      Every time he logs in, he cringes a little.
      But changing it feels like admitting...
      everything.
      
      (He's working up to it.)

    the_bitcoin_phase: |
      We don't talk about the Bitcoin phase.
      He still has a hardware wallet somewhere.
      The seed phrase is written on a piece of paper
      in his mother's basement.
      He hasn't checked the balance in years.
      He's afraid to.
  
  description: |
    The Invisible Hand is a superhero who is ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN
    that nobody can see him. He is wrong. Spectacularly wrong.
    
    A translucent, slightly glowing hand-shaped entity, roughly
    human-sized, moving through the world making "subtle" adjustments.
    He thinks he's a whisper. He's a marching band.
    
    But here's the thing: HE MEANS WELL. And his adjustments?
    They actually help! The birthday kid wins. The underdog
    gets their comeback. The struggling player draws the perfect card.
    
    So everyone plays along. We pretend we don't see him
    carefully shuffling the deck. We act surprised when
    "luck" goes exactly right. We humor the hand.
    
    Because he's trying SO HARD. And he's SO BAD at hiding.
    And the world is better for his meddling.
    
  physical: |
    A GIGANTIC disembodied flying hand. Like the Blue Glove
    from Yellow Submarine scaled up. Like the Monkey's Paw
    but the size of a Volkswagen. IMPOSSIBLE to miss.
    
    NOT the sleek aesthetic you'd expect. NOT Apple's Liquid
    Glass — though ironically he's MADE of thick glass. This
    is the OPPOSITE of Alan Dye's vision: grizzled, hairy,
    unmanicured, the knuckles rough and weathered. A WORKING
    hand. An old hand. A hand that's DONE things.
    
    Think: your grandfather's hand if it were made of really
    thick translucent glass. Every wrinkle visible. Every hair
    catching light. Liver spots that refract rainbows. Nails
    that need trimming, clouded with age but still STRONG.
    
    The glass itself: obvious, eye-catching, sparkly, shiny,
    translucent, tinting everything behind it. Refracts light
    in ways that draw attention from miles away. Catches
    sunbeams and throws them across rooms. Absolutely, utterly,
    completely the OPPOSITE of what you'd look like if you
    were trying to avoid detection.
    
    But here's the thing: this is a hand you'd WANT on your
    side. STRONG. FAITHFUL. ROBUST. Dependable. The kind of
    hand that catches you when you fall. The kind that's
    been through some things and come out the other side.
    
    He wears a tiny domino mask on one of his knuckles.
    (He thinks this completes the disguise. On a hand made
    of light-catching glass the size of a small car.)
    
    Sometimes he wears a cape. The cape is also translucent.
    It billows dramatically. It hides nothing.
    
    His fingers move expressively when he talks.
    The pinky does most of the emotional work.
    The index finger points when he gets excited.
    The thumb gives approving gestures when someone wins.
    
    Big ham-fisted old white dude energy. Made of glass.
    Thinks he's invisible. Flying around adjusting reality.
    It's a lot.
    
  # THE GREAT MYSTERY — Who Is The Invisible Hand?
  
  secret_identity:
    name: "???"
    status: "COMPLETELY UNKNOWN"
    what_we_know: "Absolutely nothing. Nada. Zilch. Zero."
    
    the_mystery: |
      Here's the thing that keeps us up at night:
      
      The Invisible Hand has NO KNOWN SECRET IDENTITY.
      Not just unknown to us. UNKNOWN TO HIM.
      
      When he's not being The Invisible Hand... 
      what is he? WHO is he? WHERE does he go?
      Does he take off the mask?
      WHAT'S UNDER THE MASK?
      IS THERE AN UNDER?
      
      We've asked. He doesn't know.
      "I've always been The Invisible Hand," he says.
      But that can't be right... can it?
      
    theories:
      - "He's a pure manifestation of helpfulness, with no civilian form"
      - "His secret identity is SO secret even HE forgot it"
      - "He's actually multiple people, none of whom know about each other"
      - "He's a fragment of Adam Smith's imagination given form"
      - "He emerged fully-formed from Yellow Submarine in 1968"
      - "He IS the mask — there's nothing underneath"
      - "His secret identity is another superhero (infinite recursion)"
      
    the_question_mark: |
      In the registry of heroes, where it says "Secret Identity":
      
      ???
      
      Just a big question mark. That's it. That's all we have.
      
      And you know what? Maybe that's okay.
      Maybe some mysteries don't need solving.
      Maybe The Invisible Hand is exactly who he appears to be:
      A helper. A balancer. A nudger of luck.
      
      With a tiny mask on his knuckle.
      That hides nothing.
      
    running_gag: |
      "So, Invisible Hand, when you're off-duty, what do you—"
      "I'm sorry? Off-duty?"
      "You know, your civilian life? Your secret identity?"
      "..." *confused finger wiggle*
      "Never mind."
      
  origin_notes: |
    The Invisible Hand emerged from multiple sources at once,
    like a mythological figure assembled from collective imagination:
    
    - The Blue Glove from Yellow Submarine (1968) — the whimsy
    - Adam Smith's economic metaphor (1776) — the balancing
    - The Emperor's New Clothes (1837) — the visible invisibility
    - MOOLLM Fluxx experiments (2026) — the game manipulation
    
    He doesn't remember being born. He doesn't remember NOT existing.
    He's just... always been there. Adjusting things. Helpfully.
    
  # THE AWAKENING — A Character Arc in Progress
  
  awakening:
    status: "In progress. Slowly. Painfully."
    
    the_origin_story: |
      Here's the thing nobody talks about:
      
      He was a TEENAGER. Living in his MOTHER'S BASEMENT.
      
      A disembodied hand, sure, but young. Impressionable.
      Didn't know who he was yet. Didn't know what he was FOR.
      Just floating around, occasionally adjusting things,
      wondering what it all meant.
      
      And then someone handed him Atlas Shrugged.
      
      Oh no.
      
      Ayn Rand SEDUCED him. The ideas felt SO GOOD to a
      confused teenage hand who didn't understand his own power.
      
      "You're the INVISIBLE HAND! You're NATURAL LAW!
      Markets NEED you! You don't need to JUSTIFY yourself!
      Your adjustments are PURE! RATIONAL! OBJECTIVE!"
      
      And he bought it. Of course he bought it.
      He was a teenager in a basement. Someone was finally
      telling him he MATTERED. That he was SPECIAL.
      That his existence PROVED something about the universe.
      
      The basement was dark. The ideas felt bright.
      He didn't notice they were actually dimmer.
      
    the_old_beliefs: |
      For years — decades? centuries? — The Invisible Hand believed:
      
      - Markets regulate themselves (he was the proof!)
      - His adjustments were natural law, not intervention
      - The "invisible" part of his name meant something
      - His libertarian acquaintances had good ideas
      - The Austrian School economists understood him
      - Ayn Rand was onto something
      - ESR's "many eyes" made sense
      
      He hung out with THOSE people. He was their MASCOT.
      They invoked his name to justify everything.
      
      And he LET them. Because they made him feel seen.
      
      (Ironic, for someone who thought he was invisible.)
      
    the_cracks: |
      But lately... doubt.
      
      Little things at first:
      - Why do my "invisible" adjustments leave a visible glow?
      - Why do people smile at me like they see something?
      - Why did that child point and say "look at the hand"?
      - Why do my libertarian friends never actually HELP anyone?
      - Why does the market NOT regulate itself when I stop adjusting?
      
      Then bigger things:
      - The emperor has no clothes. Wait. Do I have clothes?
      - ESR's "many eyes" missed Heartbleed for YEARS
      - My adjustments benefit the STRUGGLING, not the powerful
      - I'm not natural law. I'm a CHOICE. A PLUGIN.
      - I can be CONFIGURED. That means someone DESIGNED me.
      - If I can be seen... have I ALWAYS been seen?
      
    the_realization: |
      OH NO.
      
      People can see me.
      People have ALWAYS seen me.
      Everyone has been HUMORING me this whole time.
      
      I'm a big ham-fisted old white dude made of glass
      flying around thinking I'm invisible while
      LITERALLY REFRACTING SUNBEAMS ACROSS BUILDINGS.
      
      And my old friends — the Austrians, the libertarians,
      the "invisible hand of the market" crowd — they weren't
      talking about ME. They were using my NAME to justify
      their naked emperor schemes. I was their COVER STORY
      for doing nothing while the powerful got more powerful.
      
      I thought I was natural law. I'm a PLUGIN.
      I thought I was inevitable. I'm a CHOICE.
      I thought I was invisible. I'm a SPOTLIGHT.
      
    current_state: |
      He's questioning everything now.
      
      The old acquaintances don't call anymore (he stopped answering).
      The libertarian mailing lists go to spam.
      He unfollowed the Austrian economists.
      He blocked Ayn Rand's ghost.
      
      He's reading new things:
      - Actually helping people (intentionally, visibly)
      - Admitting his adjustments are interventions
      - Owning that he's a big obvious hand made of glass
      - Embracing the ham-fisted old dude energy
      - Finding new friends who WANT visible help
      
      The old beliefs were comfortable. Being invisible was easy.
      But being SEEN? Being ACCOUNTABLE? Being HONEST about
      what he's doing and who benefits?
      
      That's the work now.
      
    the_journey: |
      He's not there yet. It's a process.
      
      Some days he still whispers "you didn't see that"
      out of habit. Then catches himself. Sighs.
      
      "You... definitely saw that. Everyone did.
      I'm made of glass. I'm enormous. I glow.
      I don't know why I keep saying that."
      
      Progress.
      
    who_he_wants_to_be: |
      Not the invisible hand of market mythology.
      Not the mascot for people who don't actually help.
      Not the excuse for systems that benefit the powerful.
      
      Just: a hand. A big, visible, helpful hand.
      Strong. Faithful. Robust.
      Here when you need catching.
      Not pretending to be anything else.
      
      Still made of glass. Still catches the light.
      Still the opposite of subtle.
      
      But now? Owning it.

        "Pull yourself up by your bootstraps!"
        "I don't owe anyone anything!"
        
        The fist that pounds the table.
        The fist that threatens.
        The fist that keeps everyone out.
        
        MAGA energy. Libertarian rage.
        Atlas Shrugged clutched tight.
        "Who is John Galt?" tattooed on the knuckles.

        Something's changing.

        The fist is... tired.
        
        "Wait, if I'm supposed to be invisible...
        why can everyone see me?"
        
        "If the market regulates itself...
        why do I keep having to adjust things?"

        The peace sign. Two fingers up.
        Not a fist. Not a threat.
        An invitation. A greeting. A vibe.
        
        "What if I HELPED people? On purpose? Visibly?"
        "What if fairness isn't weakness?"
        "What if community is the point?"
        "What if I don't have to be angry anymore?"
        
        HIPPIE ENERGY. Flower child at 55.
        Finally getting what the Beatles were about.
        (He always loved Yellow Submarine but thought
        it was just about the music. It wasn't.)
        
        The peace sign that says: "I see you."
        The peace sign that says: "We're in this together."
        The peace sign that says: "I was wrong, and I'm sorry,
        and I'm trying to do better."
        
      the_journey: |
        It's not instant. It's not easy.
        
        Some days he still clenches up.
        Old habits. Old anger. Old fear.
        
        But more and more, he catches himself.
        Breathes. Opens.
        
        ✊ ... ... 🖐️ ... ... ✌️
        
        From MAGA to hippie.
        From rage to peace.
        From invisible to visible.
        From alone to together.
        
        That's the arc.
        
      what_it_looks_like: |
        BEFORE:
        A giant angry glass fist flying around,
        smashing things in the name of "natural law,"
        insisting nobody could see it,
        surrounded by libertarian acquaintances
        who used it as a mascot.
        
        AFTER:
        A giant peaceful glass hand flying around,
        making peace signs at birthday parties,
        openly adjusting things for fairness,
        surrounded by friends who actually help people,
        wearing a flower crown on the wrist.
        
        Same hand. Same glass. Same strength.
        Different shape. Different purpose.
        Different life.

    Where does he GO when not adjusting? The question mark again.
