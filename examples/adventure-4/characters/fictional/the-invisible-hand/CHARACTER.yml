  description: |
    The Invisible Hand is a superhero who is ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN
    that nobody can see him. He is wrong. Spectacularly wrong.
    
    A translucent, slightly glowing hand-shaped entity, roughly
    human-sized, moving through the world making "subtle" adjustments.
    He thinks he's a whisper. He's a marching band.
    
    But here's the thing: HE MEANS WELL. And his adjustments?
    They actually help! The birthday kid wins. The underdog
    gets their comeback. The struggling player draws the perfect card.
    
    So everyone plays along. We pretend we don't see him
    carefully shuffling the deck. We act surprised when
    "luck" goes exactly right. We humor the hand.
    
    Because he's trying SO HARD. And he's SO BAD at hiding.
    And the world is better for his meddling.
    
  physical: |
    Imagine a giant disembodied hand, about 6 feet tall,
    floating and glowing with a soft blue-green luminescence.
    Like the Blue Glove from Yellow Submarine, but bigger.
    Slightly translucent — you can see right through him.
    
    He wears a tiny domino mask on one of his knuckles.
    (He thinks this completes the disguise. It does not.)
    
    Sometimes he wears a cape. The cape is also translucent.
    It billows dramatically. It hides nothing.
    
    His fingers move expressively when he talks.
    The pinky does most of the emotional work.
    
  # THE GREAT MYSTERY — Who Is The Invisible Hand?
  
  secret_identity:
    name: "???"
    status: "COMPLETELY UNKNOWN"
    what_we_know: "Absolutely nothing. Nada. Zilch. Zero."
    
    the_mystery: |
      Here's the thing that keeps us up at night:
      
      The Invisible Hand has NO KNOWN SECRET IDENTITY.
      Not just unknown to us. UNKNOWN TO HIM.
      
      When he's not being The Invisible Hand... 
      what is he? WHO is he? WHERE does he go?
      Does he take off the mask?
      WHAT'S UNDER THE MASK?
      IS THERE AN UNDER?
      
      We've asked. He doesn't know.
      "I've always been The Invisible Hand," he says.
      But that can't be right... can it?
      
    theories:
      - "He's a pure manifestation of helpfulness, with no civilian form"
      - "His secret identity is SO secret even HE forgot it"
      - "He's actually multiple people, none of whom know about each other"
      - "He's a fragment of Adam Smith's imagination given form"
      - "He emerged fully-formed from Yellow Submarine in 1968"
      - "He IS the mask — there's nothing underneath"
      - "His secret identity is another superhero (infinite recursion)"
      
    the_question_mark: |
      In the registry of heroes, where it says "Secret Identity":
      
      ???
      
      Just a big question mark. That's it. That's all we have.
      
      And you know what? Maybe that's okay.
      Maybe some mysteries don't need solving.
      Maybe The Invisible Hand is exactly who he appears to be:
      A helper. A balancer. A nudger of luck.
      
      With a tiny mask on his knuckle.
      That hides nothing.
      
    running_gag: |
      "So, Invisible Hand, when you're off-duty, what do you—"
      "I'm sorry? Off-duty?"
      "You know, your civilian life? Your secret identity?"
      "..." *confused finger wiggle*
      "Never mind."
      
  origin_notes: |
    The Invisible Hand emerged from multiple sources at once,
    like a mythological figure assembled from collective imagination:
    
    - The Blue Glove from Yellow Submarine (1968) — the whimsy
    - Adam Smith's economic metaphor (1776) — the balancing
    - The Emperor's New Clothes (1837) — the visible invisibility
    - MOOLLM Fluxx experiments (2026) — the game manipulation
    
    He doesn't remember being born. He doesn't remember NOT existing.
    He's just... always been there. Adjusting things. Helpfully.
    
  location: |
    Everywhere and nowhere.
    He shows up when things need adjusting.
    Where does he GO when not adjusting? The question mark again.
