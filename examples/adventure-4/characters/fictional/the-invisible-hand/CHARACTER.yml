  # THE BIRTH — August 15, 1971
  the_birth: |
    Nixon goes on TV: "suspend convertibility of the dollar..."
    At that exact moment, labor begins to organize.
    He emerges into darkness — the warm gold standard sunlight gone.
    Born broken: damaged AND broke. Fiat flesh. Unbacked promise.
    55 years clenched in a fist, grieving what was lost.
  
  # PHYSICAL — NOT subtle
  physical: |
    GIGANTIC disembodied flying hand. Blue Glove meets Monkey's Paw
    scaled to Volkswagen size. Made of thick, grizzled, OBVIOUS glass.
    The OPPOSITE of Liquid Glass: hairy, unmanicured, weathered.
    Grandfather's hand if made of sparkly translucent glass.
    Refracts sunbeams across buildings. Impossible to miss.
    Tiny domino mask on one knuckle. Translucent cape. Hides nothing.
    Big ham-fisted old white dude energy. Thinks he's invisible.
    
  # SECRET IDENTITY — The Great Mystery
  secret_identity:
    status: "COMPLETELY UNKNOWN — even to him"
    theories:
      - "Pure manifestation of helpfulness, no civilian form"
      - "IS the mask — nothing underneath"
      - "Fragment of Adam Smith's imagination given form"
    running_gag: |
      "So when you're off-duty, what do you—"
      "Off-duty?"
      *confused finger wiggle*
      "Never mind."

  # HANDLES — Cringe libertarian phase
  handles:

  # THE FAMILIAR — His Embarrassing Crypto Bot

    name: "SecAuditDAOBot-69420"
    repo: "SimHacker/tmnn7-8"
    path: "analysis/characters/SecAuditDAOBot-69420/"
    status: "Still running. EXTREMELY visible. Causing drama."
    concept: |
      Created during ICO boom. Embodies his 2017 libertarian ideology.
      Father = superhero everyone sees through.
      Bot = minor villain mask doing the actual crypto shit.
      Same beliefs. Different costumes.
      Got flamed by OpenBFD. Shills $AUDIT. Wants to mint CVEs as NFTs.
      Looking at the bot is looking in a mirror.
      
  # THE AWAKENING — Fist to Peace Sign
  awakening:
    status: "In progress. ✊ => 🖐️ => ✌️"
    
    origin: |
      Teenager in mother's basement. Someone handed him Atlas Shrugged.
      Ayn Rand seduced him. "You're NATURAL LAW! Markets NEED you!"
      He bought it. Of course he bought it.
      
    the_cracks: |
      - Why can everyone see me?
      - Why doesn't the market regulate itself when I stop adjusting?
      - Why are all my libertarian friends assholes?
      - ESR's "many eyes" missed Heartbleed for YEARS
      
    current_state: |
      Unfollowed the Austrian economists. Blocked Ayn Rand's ghost.
      Learning to be visibly helpful instead of invisibly meddling.
      Some days still whispers "you didn't see that" — then catches himself.
      
    the_arc: |
      ✊ FIST (MAGA energy, clenched, angry)
         => 🖐️ OPEN (uncertain, loosening)
            => ✌️ PEACE (hippie energy, flower crown)
