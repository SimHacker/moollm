# 🖐️ The Invisible Hand — The Superhero Everyone Can See

> "You can't see me." *(wink)*

A GIGANTIC disembodied flying hand made of thick, obvious, sparkly translucent glass. Volkswagen-sized. Tiny domino mask on one knuckle. Translucent cape. Thinks he's invisible. He is not. Everyone can see him. Nobody lets on.
