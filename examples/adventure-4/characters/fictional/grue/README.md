# 🌑💀 The Grue — The Darkness That IS The Game

> *"It is pitch black. You are likely to be eaten."*

The grue is not just a monster. The grue IS the game **Don't Go In The Dark**.

The countdown exists inside the grue's being. The fear of darkness is part of the grue's soul. When you play "survive the darkness," you are playing against the grue.

The grue has no name. Names require being. The grue simply IS.

## 🎲 The Character IS The Game

| File | What It Contains |
|------|------------------|
| [CHARACTER.yml](./CHARACTER.yml) | The grue's non-soul + game mechanics |

The grue does not have instances like Snorax. The grue exists **everywhere dark**.

---

## 🎮 How The Game Works

The grue game is ALWAYS running. Every dark room is a grue game in progress.

**The Countdown:**
| Turn | Warning | What Happens |
|------|---------|--------------|
| 1 | "It is getting dark..." | Rustling in the darkness |
| 2 | "It is pitch black." | Something brushes against you |
| 3 | — | You are eaten by a grue |

**Escape:** Light your lamp. Leave the darkness. Reach The Eye (room-h).

## 🤝 Parallel Play With Snorax

The grue and Snorax run **parallel games** in the same maze:

| Game | Snorax (Wumpus) | Grue |
|------|-----------------|------|
| **Type** | Spatial puzzle | Time puzzle |
| **Location** | One room | Everywhere dark |
| **Killable?** | Yes (arrows) | No (can't kill darkness) |
| **Escape** | Navigate around | Keep light |

They don't compete. They complement. The wumpus won't enter grue territory (darkness). The grue won't enter the wumpus's lair (too smelly).

## 👁️ What The Grue Fears

Only one thing: **The Thing That Watches** (room-h).

The Eye sees through darkness. The grue cannot tolerate being SEEN.
