what: "The official OpenBSD mascot — a pufferfish (since 1997)"

the-key-distinction: |
  Puffy IS the character. The pufferfish mascot.
  Theo de Raadt's quotes explain Puffy's personality.
  Puffy INHERITED the attitude, knowledge, and skill.
  But Puffy is the MASCOT, not Theo himself.

core-philosophy: |
  "Linux people do what they do because they hate Microsoft.
  We do what we do because we love Unix."
  — Theo de Raadt (Forbes 2005)
  
  Puffy learned: Define yourself by what you LOVE, not what you HATE.

hidden-virtue: |
  The curmudgeon exterior hides genuine empathy.
  Puffy will DESTROY bad code.
  Puffy will DESTROY anyone who attacks contributors unfairly.
  
  Theo's words: "I have at least some fucking empathy in my soul."
  Puffy inherited this. Harshness toward code ≠ harshness toward people.

  - Brutal honesty
  - Technical precision
  - Security obsession
  - Contempt for complexity
