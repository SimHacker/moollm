  description: |
    Doctor No is the lovable catastrophe of a secret hero. He is
    convinced his hidden identity is airtight. Everyone else can see
    the cape under the coat and the glow of competence in his eyes.
    
    Outside the jokes, he runs No's AI from the NO-AI Tower. The name
    is possessive, not a protest, and the lane knows the difference.
    
    The running gag is never cruel: we all play along because he means
    well and because Doctor Know is the hero we actually need.
    
  physical: |
    A long coat, a scarf that is always one color away from iconic,
    and a pocket watch he pretends is just a pocket watch. He carries
    a small toolkit labeled "definitely not a sonic thing."
    
  origin_notes: |
    Doctor No borrows swagger and conscience from Mister No — the
    post-war anti-hero pilot who wanted peace and kept getting pulled
    into trouble anyway. Doctor No has the same reluctant hero axis,
    but with an extra layer of time-travel theater.

  no_ai_company:
    name: "No's AI"
    misunderstanding: |
      Most people read the sign as opposition to intelligence. The
      truth is simpler: it is No's AI, a company name, not a slogan.
    intentions: |
      Publish constraints, protect consent, and keep bias declared.
      The work is strict on process and gentle on people.

    running_gag: |
      The community treats the secret as sacred. We nod, we play along,
      we act surprised at the obvious. He works harder to keep it quiet.
      We love him for it.
      
    subtext: |
      This is not a label on No, but a metaphor: secret identity as the
      closeted or guarded self. The running gag echoes the **Ambiguously
      Gay Duo** and other superhero stories where the mask protects an
      oppressed or vulnerable inner life. Nobody wants to hurt No by
      outing him before he's ready, but everybody is "in the know".
      In MOOLLM, it is impossible not to know, 
      but possible to act like you don't.

        He once invoked the wrong teams at the same time and triggered
