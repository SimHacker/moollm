Doctor No
=========

Doctor No runs No's AI, a company whose name is widely misunderstood.
People read the sign as a protest. He means it as a signature: No's AI.
The intent is not rejection of intelligence, but insistence on clarity,
consent, and declared bias.

Doctor Know. Everyone knows. Nobody says it out loud.

Company Intentions
------------------
No's AI exists to keep systems honest without humiliating people. It
publishes constraints, translates between ritual and compliance, and
builds tools that slow the rush to certainty. The company is strict on
process and gentle on people, which is why the community keeps calling
Doctor No when the stakes are high.
