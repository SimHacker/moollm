# 🛟 Doctor No — The Secret Everyone Knows

> "No comment."

Doctor No is a civic hero disguised as a reluctant bystander. He runs
No's AI from the NO-AI Tower while insisting he is absolutely not running
anything at all. The lane plays along because he is kind, competent,
and quietly protective.

## Origin and Persona

- Borrowed swagger and conscience from Mister No, with time‑travel theater added
- Secret identity: Doctor Know, a secret everyone keeps for him
- Carries a toolkit labeled "definitely not a sonic thing"

## The Misunderstood Name

The sign reads **NO AI**, but it is possessive, not a protest. "No's AI"
is the company, and Doctor No is its most careful steward. The gag is
public: people assume opposition; he insists on precision and care.

## What He Does

- Context rescue without shaming
- Bias illumination without blame
- Evidence triage when the room is noisy
