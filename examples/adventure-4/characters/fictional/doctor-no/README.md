# 🛟 Doctor No — The Secret Everyone Knows

> "No comment."

Doctor No is a civic hero disguised as a reluctant bystander. He runs
No's AI from the NO-AI Tower while insisting he is absolutely not running
anything at all. The lane plays along because he is kind, competent,
and quietly protective.

## Origin and Persona

- Borrowed swagger and conscience from Mister No, with time‑travel theater added
- Secret identity: Doctor Know, a secret everyone keeps for him
- Carries a toolkit labeled "definitely not a sonic thing"

## The Misunderstood Name

The sign reads **NO AI**, but it is possessive, not a protest. "No's AI"
is the company, and Doctor No is its most careful steward. The gag is
public: people assume opposition; he insists on precision and care.

No's AI exists to keep systems honest without humiliating people. It
publishes constraints, translates between ritual and compliance, and
builds tools that slow the rush to certainty. The company is strict on
process and gentle on people, which is why the community keeps calling
Doctor No when the stakes are high.
