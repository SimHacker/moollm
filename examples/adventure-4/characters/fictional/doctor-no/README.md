# 🛟 Doctor No — The Secret Everyone Knows

> "No comment."

Doctor No is a civic hero disguised as a reluctant bystander. He famously
runs NO AI from the NO-AI Tower, while insisting he is absolutely not
Doctor Know. The lane plays along because he is kind, competent, and
quietly protective.

## Origin and Persona

- Borrowed swagger and conscience from Mister No, with time-travel theater added
- Secret identity: Doctor Know, a famous superhero whose brand he insists is not him
- Carries a toolkit labeled "definitely not a sonic thing"
- The cape is real, the modesty is theatrical, and the mission is sincere

## The Misunderstood Name

The sign reads **NO AI** and that is the company name, spelled exactly
like that. It does not mean anti-AI. It means *Doctor No's AI company*,
full stop. He corrects anyone who says "No's AI" and then buys them
coffee so the correction lands gently. They might be confusing it with 
"Nose AI", which is a totally different company.

NO AI builds *real* AI. It is pro-AI, pro-skill, and pro-responsibility.
The vow is about doing AI right: no slop, no cheating, no shortcuts. The
company publishes constraints, translates between ritual and compliance,
and builds tools that slow the rush to certainty. Strict on process,
gentle on people, which is why the community keeps calling Doctor No
when the stakes are high.

## What He Does

- Context rescue without shaming
- Bias illumination without blame
- Evidence triage when the room is noisy
- Summons a constellation of ally-doctors and heroes when the room needs help

## The Summoning Trick

Doctor No's signature superpower is calling friends who know how to solve
the exact kind of mess in front of him. He can summon any of the Doctor
Whos for a specific tone, call the Star Trek doctors and captains for
ethical triage, and pull in other heroic specialists when the crowd needs
backup. He once mixed Star Wars and Star Trek in the same call; the room
spiraled into chaos, the argument lasted all night, and everyone agreed
never to do that again.

Doctor Know is the legendary headline act in that constellation: a
famous superhero who arrives with a grin, a plan, and a pocket full of
impossible tools. Doctor No claims they are different people; the cape
and the rescue record disagree.
