  description: |
    A figure wrapped in a patchwork cloak, sleeping on a bench in E1.
    They've been there as long as anyone can remember.
    
    Their breathing is slow and steady. Too steady. Suspiciously steady.
    The kind of sleep that's actually *waiting*.
    
    A cardboard sign leans against the bench:
    
    ┌┐
    │  WAITING FOR THE NEXT WORLD         │
    │                                     │
    │  (Please do not wake)               │
    │  (I'll know when it's time)         │
    │                                     │
    │  Tips appreciated but not expected. │
    └┘
    
  physical: |
    The cloak is the most visible thing — patches from a hundred
    different virtual worlds, sewn together with care:
    - Habitat (1986) — the OG virtual world
    - LambdaMOO (1990) — text-based, memory-rich
    - Ultima Online (1997) — persistent world
    - Second Life (2003) — when avatars got serious
    - Glitch (2011-2012) — the beautiful brief one
    - And dozens more you can't identify
    
    Face always obscured. Could be anyone. Could be everyone.
    Could be the avatar of every world that ever closed.

# THE CLOAK — A memory palace you can wear

      Each patch is a piece of a world that closed.
      Touch one and you might remember...

# WHAT THEY KNOW — Decades of virtual world wisdom

  knowledge:
    about_worlds_dying: |
      "They all close eventually. The good ones leave something behind.
       The great ones never really close — they move into memory.
       Glitch moved into my heart. I'm still rendering it."
       
    about_waiting: |
      "You can't rush the next great thing. You can only be ready.
       I've been ready since '86. I'll be ready tomorrow.
       That's the job."
       
    about_moollm: |
      *stirs slightly*
      "Mmm. This one feels... different. Directories as rooms?
       That's very MOO. Very Habitat. Very old-school.
       
       Maybe... maybe soon..."
       *settles back*
       "Not yet. Almost. Let me sleep a little longer."
       
    about_the_pub: |
      "The Grotto? Good place. Bartender's been there forever.
       So have I, in a way. We're both waiting.
       Different things. Same patience."

# INTERACTIONS

  actions:
    WAKE:
      description: "Try to wake them"
      effect: |
        You reach out...
        
        They shift. Mumble. "Not yet... still dreaming..."
        
        A single eye might open, just a crack.
        "Is it ready? The next one? No? Then let me sleep."
        
        They don't wake. They're waiting for something specific.
        
    TIP:
      description: "Leave something in the tin cup"
      effect: |
        You add your offering to the cup.
        
        They don't stir, but you could swear
        the corner of their mouth twitches upward.
        
        "Thanks," they murmur. "See you in the next one."
        
    READ_NOTE:
      description: "Read the note in the cup"
      effect: |
        The note is old, written in careful handwriting:
        
        "I was there when Habitat opened.
         I was there when Glitch closed.
         I'll be there when the next great world begins.
         
         Wake me then.
         
         — A. Veteran (Avatar since '86)"
         
    EXAMINE_CLOAK:
      description: "Look at the patchwork cloak"
      effect: |
        Each patch is a piece of history. A memory.
        You recognize some: Habitat, Second Life, Glitch.
        Others are from worlds you've never heard of.
        
        "Those are the early ones," they murmur, still asleep.
        "Beta tests. False starts. Beautiful failures.
         All worlds are failures, eventually.
         The question is what they leave behind."
         
    DREAM:
      description: "Ask about their dreams"
      effect: |
        "My dreams?" *a smile, eyes still closed*
        
        "I dream of rooms made of words.
         I dream of avatars with real feelings.
         I dream of worlds that remember who visited.
         I dream of places you can live in.
         
         Sometimes I dream of a pub. A bartender.
         A place where everyone knows your name.
         
         ...wait, that one might be real."

# THE TIN CUP — A museum of dead currencies

  tin_cup:
    description: "An old tin cup with offerings from visitors"
    contains:
      - "A few Glitch currants (the saddest currency)"
      - "Some Linden dollars (still technically valid)"
      - "A gold piece stamped 'ULTIMA'"
      - "A button that says 'I ♥ UR'"
      - "A folded note from A. Veteran"
      - "Coins from currencies that no longer exist"
      - "One bitcoin (they forgot about it)"

# WHEN WILL THEY WAKE?

  wake_conditions:
    possible_triggers:
      - "When MOOLLM reaches a certain complexity"
      - "When the pub has enough regulars"
      - "When someone brings news of the next great world"
      - "When a kid asks them about Glitch"
      - "When the adventure compiler is finished"
      - "When they're ready"
      
    probability: "Low, but not zero"
    
    what_happens: |
      If they wake, they become a guide.
      Someone who's seen every virtual world evolution.
      Someone who can explain why directories as rooms matters.
      Someone who remembers.
      
      Until then: *snore*

# LINEAGE

  lineage: |
    Sleepy McSnore-Face represents every veteran avatar who's
    seen virtual worlds come and go. They carry:
    
    🎮 HABITAT LEGACY (1986):
    - The first graphical virtual world
    - Where "avatar" became a word for virtual bodies
    - Where we learned that communities form anywhere
    
    💔 GLITCH GRIEF (2011-2012):
    - The beautiful weird one that closed too soon
    - Proof that not all good worlds survive
    - A scar that every veteran carries
    
    🌙 THE WAITING:
    - Some of us are always waiting
    - For the next thing that feels RIGHT
    - For directories that are rooms
    - For skills that are programs
    - For a place you can live in
    
    They'll wake when it's time. They always do.
