# 😴 Sleepy McSnore-Face — The Eternal Dreamer

> "Wake me when it's ready."

A figure on a bench in E1, wrapped in a patchwork cloak sewn from a hundred dead virtual worlds. Asleep since '86. Waiting for the next great one.

## The Cloak

Each patch is a world that closed: Habitat (1986), LambdaMOO (1990), Ultima Online (1997), Second Life (2003), Glitch (2011). Dozens more you can't identify.

## The Tin Cup

A museum of dead currencies: Glitch currants, Linden dollars, an Ultima gold piece, one bitcoin (they forgot about it).

## Interactions

- **WAKE** — "Not yet. Still dreaming."
- **TIP** — "Thanks. See you in the next one."
- **EXAMINE CLOAK** — "Those are the early ones. Beta tests. Beautiful failures."

## Relationships

- [**The Bartender**](../the-bartender/) — "We're both waiting. Different things. Same patience."
- The bench — Home since Habitat.

## Lineage

Every veteran avatar who watched a world close. A. Veteran. Avatar since '86.
