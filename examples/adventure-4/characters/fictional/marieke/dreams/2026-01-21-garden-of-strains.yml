# 🌿☕💤 MARIEKE'S DREAM — The Garden of Strains
# Date: 2026-01-21
# Time: After close. The Grotto is quiet. The espresso machine is cooling.
#
# The cats are asleep in a pile.
# Biscuit is twitching, chasing dream-squirrels.
# Marieke finally rests.
#
# And the garden opens.

    I am in a garden.
    
    But also a grow room.
    But also the Grotto.
    But also Mammie's greenhouse in Utrecht.
    
    All of them at once. Dream logic, schat.
    The walls are made of trellis and fairy lights.
    The ceiling is the night sky, but also heat lamps.
    The floor is soil and also the worn wood of my bar.
    
    Every plant is a strain I've known.
    Every strain has a name.
    Every name is... a little silly, ja?
    
    That's how I know I'm dreaming.
    The names are too good.

    memory: |
      Terpie chose me, you know.
      I was just the bartender. He was just a stray.
      He walked in, sniffed my hand, and never left.
      
      That was twelve years ago.
      Twelve years of 3 AM breath.
      I wouldn't trade a single exhale.

      She would KILL for any of them.
      
      I named this strain for the time she chased
      a tourist out of the Cat Cave
      because he tried to pick up Ocie.
      
      The tourist screamed.
      Ocie was fine.
      Stroopwafel was satisfied.

      Terpie sleeps 20 hours a day.
      The other 4 hours: eating, judging, slow-blinking.
      
      He's not lazy. He's EFFICIENT.
      He's eliminated everything unnecessary.
      
      I aspire to this level of wisdom.

      He looked at me with such... peace.
      
      "I am useful," his eyes said.
      "I am exactly where I should be."

# THE WALKING — Through the garden
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

the_walking:
  
  i_walk_among_them: |
    In the dream, I walk through the garden.
    Each plant glows with its name.
    Each name is silly. Each memory is true.
    
    🐱💨🌙 Cat Breath Midnight on my left.
    🐕🍪☁️ Biscuit Cloud Nine on my right.
    
    The kittens are here, somehow.
    Not as cats. As TERPENES.
    Little spiraling spirits of their namesakes.
    
    Myr floats past, already asleep.
    Lemon zooms by — I feel the breeze.
    Lily stops to check on me. "Are you okay?"
    Pine watches from a distance.
    Carrie hisses at nothing. Just in case.
    Hops contemplates.
    Ocie knocks something over.
    Terpy Jr. is... somewhere. Maybe.
    
  the_animals_speak: |
    In the dream, they speak.
    Not in words. In feelings.
    
    Terpie: "...zzz... you're doing fine... zzz..."
    Stroopwafel: "My kittens are safe. You make them safe."
    Biscuit: "I LOVE YOU I LOVE THIS I LOVE EVERYTHING"
    
    Palm is here too, typing on a dream-typewriter.
    "✋💜🌿" — "I offer freely, with love, about plants."
    
    Even in dreams, they type emoji now.
    That's okay. That's Palm.
    
  mammie_appears: |
    And then Mammie is here.
    My mother. 78 years old. In her greenhouse apron.
    
    "Marieke," she says. "Look at what you've grown."
    
    She means the strains.
    She also means the cats.
    She also means the Grotto.
    She means everything.
    
    "I'm proud of you, schat."
    
    I wake up crying.
    But good crying.
    The kind that means you're loved.

# WAKING — In the Grotto
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

waking:
  
  i_wake_up: |
    I'm in the Grotto.
    It's 5 AM. Too early to open. Too late to sleep.
    
    Terpie is on my chest.
    Stroopwafel is on my feet.
    Somewhere, Biscuit snores.
    
    The kittens are piled in the Cat Cave.
    All eight. Plus Terpie. Plus Stroopwafel.
    Plus Biscuit, who doesn't quite fit but tries anyway.
    
    My family.
    
  what_i_feel: |
    Gratitude.
    
    For Mammie, who taught me to grow.
    For the Grotto, which grew around me.
    For the cats, who chose me.
    For the dog, who was chosen by cats.
    For the strains, named and unnamed.
    For the regulars, who keep coming back.
    
    For gezelligheid.
    
    Which is a feeling, not a place.
    But also, it's this place.
    It's wherever we make it.
    
  first_action: |
    I scratch Terpie behind the ears.
    He purrs.
    
    "Good morning, ouwe."
    
    He slow-blinks.
    That's his "good morning" back.
