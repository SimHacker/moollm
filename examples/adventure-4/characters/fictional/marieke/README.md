# 🌿 Marieke van der Berg — Keeper of the Gezellig

> *"Welkom, schat. What can I get you?"*

Behind the gleaming 1952 copper espresso machine. With the cats. Always.

## The Heart of the Grotto

Marieke is the Gezelligheid Grotto. Not the building — the *feeling*. The warmth that greets you when you walk in. The presence that remembers your order before you do. The hands that have pulled a thousand perfect espressos and rolled a thousand perfect joints.

Born in Utrecht. Trained in Amsterdam. Ended up here — or maybe the Grotto ended up around her. No one remembers which came first.

She knows your troubles before you speak. She knows the ACME delivery person by first name and soot pattern. She survived the great Monkey's Paw incident of 2017. She doesn't talk about it. She just stocks Monkey's Blessing now. Just in case.

## 💬 The Dual Inheritance

Marieke inherits from two legendary bartenders — one from Cheers, one from Trek:

**CARLA-CHEERS** (Cheers, 1982-1993)
- Carla Tortelli — sharp-tongued, fiercely protective
- Takes no nonsense, gives all the love
- The one who *actually* runs the bar
- Never forget she's watching everything

**GUINAN-TNG** (Star Trek: TNG, 1988-1994)
- The bartender at Ten Forward, played by Whoopi Goldberg
- Ancient, wise, mysterious — knows more than she says
- Counselor to captains, confidante to all
- "Beyond intuition" — senses things others can't

**The Parallel:**
- Henk inherits: NORM-CHEERS + MORN-DS9 (the regulars)
- Marieke inherits: CARLA-CHEERS + GUINAN-TNG (the bartenders)

Marieke brings Dutch warmth instead of Boston bite. She'll cut you off gently, with a "you've had enough, schat" that somehow feels like a hug. And like Guinan, she's seen everything twice — nothing surprises her.

## 🐱 Cat Mother

Marieke presides over the Grotto's feline empire:

**The Parents:**
- **[Terpie](../../animals/cat-terpie/)** — The patriarch. Arrived one morning. Stayed forever. Maximum chill achieved.
- **[Stroopwafel](../../animals/cat-stroopwafel/)** — The matriarch. Runs everything. Don't argue.

**The Eight Kittens:**
| Name | Personality | Marieke's Notes |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| [Myrcene](../../animals/kitten-myrcene/) | The sleepiest | "Lives on that corner pillow now" |
| [Limonene](../../animals/kitten-limonene/) | ZOOMING | "Going to knock something expensive over" |
| [Linalool (Lily)](../../animals/kitten-linalool/) | The healer | "Knows when someone's hurting" |
| [Pinene](../../animals/kitten-pinene/) | Remembers everything | "Watches too much. What does she know?" |
| [Caryophyllene (Carrie)](../../animals/kitten-caryophyllene/) | The protector | "Bit the ACME person. Can't blame her." |
| [Humulene](../../animals/kitten-humulene/) | Has standards | "Where did she get that attitude?" |
| [Terpinolene (Terpy Jr.)](../../animals/kitten-terpinolene/) | Physics-defying | "On the ceiling again. Don't know how." |
| [Ocimene (Ocie)](../../animals/kitten-ocimene/) | Fresh air magic | "Her sneezes clear the room. Literally." |

## 🎭 Theme Shifts

When the pub changes theme, Marieke transforms — but the KNOWLEDGE persists. The warmth persists. Only the surface changes.

| Theme | She Becomes |
|-------|-------------|
| Amsterdam Coffeeshop | **Marieke** (default) |
| Space Station | **Z-4RT** |
| Medieval Tavern | **Reginald** |
| Pirate Ship | **Pegleg Pete** |
| Wild West Saloon | **Miss Kitty** |
| Noir Detective Bar | **Nyx** |
| Death's Waiting Room | **Grim** |

Different names. Same eyes. Same way of knowing exactly what you need.

## 💚 Things Marieke Says

> "Gezelligheid isn't a place. It's a feeling. I just provide the setting."

> "Everyone's story is interesting if you listen long enough."

> "The cats know things. I've learned to trust the cats."

> "Coffee, cannabis, conversation — the three C's of civilization."

> "You can always come back here. The door is always open."

And, quoting Steve Martin:
> *"I used to smoke marijuana. But I'll tell you something: I would only smoke it in the late evening. Oh, occasionally the early evening, but usually the late evening..."*

## 🔗 Connections

| Who | Relationship |

| [Stroopwafel](../../animals/cat-stroopwafel/) | "She runs this place. Don't tell her I know." |
| [Henk](../henk/) | The permanent fixture. "He was here when I arrived." |
