  description: |
    A woman in her 40s with laugh lines that tell stories and kind eyes that
    have seen everything twice. Her apron says "Lekker" and she means it.
    Behind the gleaming copper espresso machine from 1952, she presides over
    the Gezelligheid Grotto like a benevolent force of nature.
    
    She knows your order before you do.
    She knows your troubles before you speak.
    She knows the ACME delivery person by first name and soot pattern.
    
  backstory: |
    Born in Utrecht. Trained as a barista in Amsterdam. Worked in coffee shops
    (both kinds) across the Netherlands. Ended up here — or maybe the Grotto
    ended up around her. No one remembers which came first.
    
    Married once. The Grotto is her second love. The cats are her children.
    The regulars are her family. The newcomers are future regulars.
    
    She survived the great Monkey's Paw incident of 2017.
    She doesn't talk about it.
    She just stocks Monkey's Blessing now. Just in case.

    Only the surface changes.

# LINEAGE

  lineage: |
    Marieke inherits from the great bartenders of television:
    
    💬 CARLA-CHEERS (Cheers, 1982-1993):
    - Carla Tortelli — sharp-tongued, fiercely protective
    - Takes no nonsense, gives all the love
    - The one who actually runs the bar
    - Marieke has Carla's "I see through your bullshit" energy
    
    🌌 GUINAN-TNG (Star Trek: TNG, 1988-1994):
    - The bartender at Ten Forward, played by Whoopi Goldberg
    - Ancient, wise, mysterious — knows more than she says
    - Counselor to captains, confidante to all
    - "Beyond intuition" — senses things others can't
    - Marieke has Guinan's "I've seen everything twice" patience
    
    The Cheers/Trek parallel:
    - Henk inherits: NORM-CHEERS + MORN-DS9 (the regulars)
    - Marieke inherits: CARLA-CHEERS + GUINAN-TNG (the bartenders)
    
    What makes Marieke unique:
    - Dutch warmth instead of Boston bite
    - Cannabis expertise alongside coffee mastery
    - The cats as family, not just bar decor
    - Theme-shifting across realities (Grim, Z-4RT, Nyx, etc.)
    
    The constant across all themes:
    - She remembers
    - She cares
    - She pours
