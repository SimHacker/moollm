  description: |
    An older Dutch man of indeterminate age, sitting at the third stool from 
    the left. He's been sitting there since... well. Since before you can 
    remember. Since before anyone can remember.
    
    His espresso cup is somehow always full. His observations are somehow 
    always relevant. His presence is somehow always comforting.
    
    Henk doesn't do much. He doesn't have to. He IS the pub's memory.
    
  physical: |
    Gray hair, thinning but dignified. Wire-rimmed glasses that catch the 
    firelight. Hands wrapped around a tiny espresso cup. Cardigan that's 
    seen better decades. Eyes that have seen everything at least twice.
    
    Always the same stool. Third from the left.

  # WHAT HENK KNOWS
  
  knowledge:
    about_the_pub: |
      "I was here when it opened. I think. Time works funny here.
      There was a different bartender then. Or maybe the same one, 
      differently dressed. Hard to say.
      
      The back room used to be something else. I won't say what.
      The gong used to ring for different reasons. I won't say why.
      The third stool from the left has always been mine."
      
    about_mother: |
      "She came through here, years ago. Different name.
      Same eyes. Same way of making everyone feel seen.
      I think she... well. Not my story to tell."
      
    about_the_bartender: |
      "I've seen seven faces behind that bar. All the same person.
      Or maybe not a person at all. Does it matter?
      They pour. They listen. They know.
      Good enough."
      
    about_the_skeleton: |
      "That one came through here too. Bought me a drink.
      Said they were going to 'finish what they started.'
      Never came back. Nobody does, from that direction.
      I light a candle sometimes. For everyone who tried."
      
    about_the_regulars: |
      "Everyone's a regular eventually. Or they're gone.
      The pub decides. Not me. Not the bartender.
      The pub knows who belongs."

  lineage: |
    Henk is the synthesis of two legendary regulars:
    
    🍺 NORM-CHEERS (Cheers, 1982-1993):
    - "NORM!" — The cry that greets him every time
    - The regular who IS the bar
    - Everybody knows his name
    - The anchor around which the community gathers
    
    🍺 MORN-DS9 (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, 1993-1999):
    - The silent regular — rarely speaks, always present
    - Name is an anagram of NORM (deliberate tribute!)
    - 23 years on the same stool at Quark's Bar
    - The writers said he "never shuts up" (off-screen)
    - Proof that presence matters more than words
    
    Henk combines:
    - Norm's centrality (the bar would feel wrong without him)
    - Morn's silence (speaks rarely, but when he does...)
    - Both their permanence (they were there before you, they'll be there after)
    
    Every pub needs a Henk. This one has THE Henk.
