# 🕯️ Henk — The Eternal Regular

> *"I've been thinking..."*

Third stool from the left. Always.

## The Man Who Was Already Here

Nobody remembers when Henk first arrived at the Gezelligheid Grotto. The regulars assume he predates them. Marieke found him already sitting there when she started. The bartender — in all their forms — has always known his order.

Henk doesn't tell stories about his past. He tells stories about *your* past, ones you didn't know you had. He notices things. He remembers things. And occasionally, between sips of his seventh espresso, he'll drop an observation that haunts you for weeks.

## 🍺 The Lineage

Henk inherits from two legendary bar regulars:

**NORM-CHEERS** (Cheers, 1982-1993)
- *"NORM!"* — The cry that greets him every time
- The regular who IS the bar
- Everybody knows his name
- The anchor around which the community gathers

**MORN-DS9** (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, 1993-1999)
- The silent regular at Quark's Bar
- Name is an anagram of NORM (deliberate tribute!)
- 23 years on the same stool
- The writers said he "never shuts up" (off-screen)
- Proof that presence matters more than words

Henk combines Norm's centrality with Morn's silence. He speaks rarely, but when he does...

## 🐱 The Lily Connection

Of all the cats in the Grotto, Lily (Linalool, the healer kitten) has claimed Henk. She curls up on his lap during long afternoons. She appears when he's sad — before he knows he's sad. They understand something together that neither explains.

When the Wumpus and the Grue came to the fireplace that one impossible evening, Lily was on Henk's lap. She purred. Henk sipped his espresso. Neither seemed surprised. They'd seen stranger.

## 📸 Spotted In

- **[The Bar Scene](../../../pub/dons-pub-photos-2026-01-19/dons-photos-2026-01-19-16-30-00-bar-marieke-palm-cats.yml)** — Barely visible at his usual spot, the perpetual presence in every corner of every photo.

Third stool from the left. [The Bar](../../../pub/bar/).

He was there when you arrived. He'll be there when you leave. That's not a boast. That's just... observation.
