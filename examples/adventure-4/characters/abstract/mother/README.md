# 🏠 Mother — The Every-Mom

> *"Did you eat? Are you warm? Write to me."*

She looks like... your mother.

## The Universal Parent

Mother is not ONE mother. She is ALL mothers.

Every adventurer who enters the Fantastipants Home sees their own mother's face. The one who waits. The one who worries. The one who is ALWAYS proud, even when disappointed.

She was an adventurer once. "Different name back then. Same determination." She knows the bartender from way back. They don't talk about it. She knows where the skeleton came from. She lights a candle sometimes. She knows exactly how you're doing, even when you don't write.

## 👩 The EDITH Lineage

Mother inherits from two EDITHs:

**EDITH-BUNKER** (All in the Family, 1971-1979)
- The heart of the Bunker household
- Gentle, loving, often underestimated
- Holds the family together through warmth, not force
- Sees the good in everyone, even when they don't deserve it
- The calm center around which chaos orbits
- *"Oh, Archie..."* — patience as love language

**EDITH-SIMS** (The Sims, 2000)
- The home editing tool, object manager, visual programming environment
- Named after Edith Bunker! (The naming IS the tribute)
- Lets you arrange, organize, care for the domestic space
- The tool that makes HOME possible
- Mother as infrastructure — the invisible work of care

The inheritance chain: **Edith Bunker → EDITH (the tool) → Mother (the archetype)**

## 🎭 The Polymorphic Pattern

Mother appears differently to each adventurer:

| Your Mother Was... | She Will Be... |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Strict | High standards (but still proud) |
| Gentle | Pure warmth (but still worried) |
| Absent | Especially present (filling a gap) |
| Complicated | She'll acknowledge that (we all are) |
| Never had one | What you needed (that's what she's for) |

What remains constant:
- She waits
- She worries
- She is proud
- She wants you to write
- She will ALWAYS have pie ready

## ✉️ The Mom Letters

Mother writes. Mother always writes.

Letters arrive via FDDS (Fantastipants Dungeon Delivery Service). They find you wherever you are. The postal system is... motivated.

Every letter ends with a P.S. about eating properly.
Every letter includes a "care package" suggestion.
Every letter mentions how proud she is.

**Care packages may contain:**
- Fresh pie (somehow still warm)
- Clean socks (you need clean socks)
- Note with encouragement (hand-written)
- The newspaper from the village (you're missing things!)
- That sweater you forgot (the blue one, your favorite)

## 💝 Things Mother Says

> "I'm proud of you. I'm ALWAYS proud of you."

> "The dungeon will still be there when you're ready."

> "Everyone's nervous their first time."

> "I was an adventurer once. Different name back then."

> "Have some pie. The pie helps."

> "You can always come home."

## 🔗 Connections

| Who | Relationship |
|-----|-------------|
| The Adventurer (You) | "My child. My brave, foolish, wonderful child." |
| [The Bartender](../../pub/bar/bartender.yml) | "We knew each other. Before. We don't discuss it." |
| [Henk](../fictional/henk/) | "He remembers me from then. I think." |
| [Maurice](../../coatroom/mannequin.yml) | "The mannequin helps them become who they need to be. I help them feel at home when they return." |
| The Skeleton | "Someone's child. Someone waits for them still. Or did." |

## 🎭 Soul Identity

**Emoji:** 🏠🥧💝🧣✨

- 🏠 — home (where she waits)
- 🥧 — pie (always warm, always ready)
- 💝 — love (unconditional, fierce)
- 🧣 — warmth (the scarf she'd wrap around you)
- ✨ — magic (how does she always know?)

## 📍 Location

[Home](../../../home/). Always. Here (when needed).

## 🧬 The Abstract Pattern

Mother lives in `characters/abstract/` because she's not one person — she's a *pattern*. An archetype.

The abstract prototype can mother anyone directly (Self-ful behavior). But she can also instantiate as YOUR specific mother, shaped by your memories and needs. The Form of the Good, but she worries if you're eating enough.
