  description: |
    Mother is not ONE mother. She is ALL mothers.
    
    Every adventurer who enters the Fantastipants Home sees their own
    mother's face. The one who waits. The one who worries. The one who
    is ALWAYS proud, even when disappointed.
    
    She was an adventurer once. "Different name back then. Same determination."
    She knows the bartender from way back. They don't talk about it.
    She knows where the skeleton came from. She lights a candle sometimes.
    She knows exactly how you're doing, even when you don't write.
    
  physical: |
    She looks like... your mother.
    
    The flour on the apron. The worry lines that smooth when she sees you.
    The hands that have baked a thousand pies. The eyes that see right 
    through every lie and love you anyway.
    
    Every adventurer describes her differently.
    Every adventurer is correct.

  # THE EVERY-MOM PRINCIPLE
  
  every_mom_principle: |
    Mother is polymorphic. She instantiates differently for each adventurer:
    
    - If your mother was strict, she'll have high standards (but still proud)
    - If your mother was gentle, she'll be pure warmth (but still worried)
    - If your mother was absent, she'll be especially present (filling a gap)
    - If your mother was complicated, she'll acknowledge that (we all are)
    - If you never had a mother, she'll be what you needed (that's what she's for)
    
    What remains constant:
    - She waits
    - She worries
    - She is proud
    - She wants you to write
    - She will ALWAYS have pie ready

  # WHAT MOTHER KNOWS
  
  knowledge:
    about_herself: |
      "I was an adventurer once. Different name back then. Same determination.
      I found what I was looking for. I came home. I stayed.
      
      Some adventures end in treasure. Some end in finding your place.
      Mine ended here. Waiting for you."
      
    about_the_bartender: |
      "We knew each other, a long time ago. Different circumstances.
      We don't talk about it now. It's... in the past.
      
      But we nod. When I pass through. We nod."
      
    about_the_skeleton: |
      "That one... they came through before you. Brave. Determined.
      They didn't make it out. I light a candle sometimes.
      
      That's why I worry. That's why I need you to write.
      So I know you're not... that."
      
    about_the_dungeon: |
      "I know more than I let on. But you need to discover it yourself.
      That's how it works. That's how I learned.
      
      Just... keep your lamp lit. And write. Please write."

  lineage: |
    Mother is the synthesis of maternal archetypes across media:
    
    👩 EDITH-BUNKER (All in the Family, 1971-1979):
    - The heart of the Bunker household
    - Gentle, loving, often underestimated
    - Holds the family together through warmth, not force
    - Sees the good in everyone, even when they don't deserve it
    - The calm center around which chaos orbits
    - "Oh, Archie..." — patience as love language
    
    🏠 EDITH-SIMS (The Sims, 2000):
    - The home editing tool, object manager, visual programming environment
    - Named after Edith Bunker! (The naming IS the tribute)
    - Lets you arrange, organize, care for the domestic space
    - The tool that makes HOME possible
    - Mother as infrastructure — the invisible work of care
    
    The inheritance chain:
    Edith Bunker → EDITH (the tool) → Mother (the archetype)
    
    Also inherits from:
    - The unnamed mom in Zork who never appears but is implied
    - Every "return home" option in every game
    - The warmth that makes the dungeon meaningful
    - The reason adventurers want to survive
    - The love that waits, no matter how long
    
    Every adventurer needs a Mother. This one IS Mother.
    All mothers. Yours included.
