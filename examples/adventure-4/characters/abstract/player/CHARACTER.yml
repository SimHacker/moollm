  description: |
    A figure stirs in the Chamber of Commencement. Who are they?
    Where did they come from? What costume will they choose?
    
    The adventure awaits. The lamp glows. Mother's note beckons.
    
  backstory: |
    You don't remember much. Just a feeling of... beginning.
    There's a note somewhere. Something about promises.
    The initials on the wall tell of those who came before.

      who became Captain Ashford, slew a grue with blue cheese, and
      went home to matching Nomi capes with Mother.
      
      The grue has respawned. The food is restocked. The lamp is full.
      But the world remembers. Maurice remembers. The skeleton waits.
