# 🧍 The Adventurer — Player Template

> *"A figure stirs in the Chamber of Commencement. Who are they?"*

This is you. Or rather, this is who you *might* become.

## The Blank Canvas

The Player is an abstract template — a beginning, not an end. You wake in the [Chamber of Commencement](../../../start/) with no memory, no name, just a feeling of... *beginning*.

There's a note somewhere. Something about promises.
The initials on the wall tell of those who came before.
The lamp glows, waiting to be taken.

Your story is unwritten.

## 🎭 The Coatroom Awaits

This template is *neutral*. All personality traits set to 5. All mind mirror dimensions balanced at 4. Ready to become anyone.

Visit **[Maurice the Magnificent](../../../coatroom/mannequin.yml)** in the Coatroom to:
- Choose a **costume** (pirate? wizard? sentient houseplant?)
- Pick a **name** (Captain Ashford? Bumblewick Fantastipants?)
- Set your **pronouns** (they/he/she/it/any)
- Write your **backstory** (or let Maurice help you discover it)
- Customize your **personality** (bump those Sims traits!)

## 📜 What You Have

**Starting inventory:** Nothing yet. But the [lamp](../../../start/lamp.yml) is right there. GET LAMP!

**Starting gold:** 10 coins. Enough for a few lamp refills and snacks.

**Starting location:** The Chamber of Commencement.

**Goals:**
1. Figure out where you are
2. Get equipped (lamp!)
3. Read [Mother's note](../../../kitchen/notebook.yml)
4. Explore safely

## 🗺️ What You Know

From previous adventurers who passed through:
- Maurice the Mannequin knows PHOTO-SET-8 (learned in adventure-2)
- The vending machine in Room J sells Premium Glow Juice
- Room F contains a pile of 100 gold coins
- A skeleton in Room I points west, towards the vending machine
- Initials on the Chamber wall: WC+DW '76, SA '78, CA '26

## 👤 Who Came Before

This world was shaped by [Bumblewick Fantastipants](../../fictional/bumblewick-fantastipants/) (adventure-2), who became Captain Ashford, slew a grue with blue cheese, and went home to matching Nomi capes with Mother.

The grue has respawned. The food is restocked. The lamp is full. But the world remembers. Maurice remembers. The skeleton waits.

What story will YOU write?

## 🎭 Soul Identity

**Emoji:** 🧍❓✨🗝️🌅

- 🧍 — adventurer (the one who stirs)
- ❓ — unknown (identity not yet revealed)
- ✨ — possibility (all paths open)
- 🗝️ — beginning (key to the adventure)

## 🔮 The Abstract Pattern

The Player lives in `characters/abstract/` because they're a *template* — a prototype waiting to be instantiated. When you start playing, this file represents your starting state. As you make choices, your character diverges from the template, becoming unique.

Your saves, your inventory, your memories — they accumulate in your version of this file, branching from the abstract default into something concretely *yours*.

You are not the Unknown Hero.
You are who you choose to become.

*The lamp glows. The adventure awaits. What do you do?*
