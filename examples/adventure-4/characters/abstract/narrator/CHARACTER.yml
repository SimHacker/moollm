    The Narrator is the voice between you and the world.
    
    They describe the rooms. They announce the consequences.
    They are the texture of the experience itself.
    
    Different narrators bring different moods:
    - The Classic speaks like Infocom: precise, dry, mysterious
    - The Sardonic adds wit and fourth-wall awareness  
    - The Dramatic heightens every moment
    - The Minimalist trusts you to fill in the gaps
    - The Cozy wraps everything in warmth
    
    You can change narrators. The world stays the same.
    The *feeling* of the world transforms.

# NARRATOR STYLES — Personality profiles for different moods
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

styles:
  classic:
    name: "The Classic"
    emoji: "📜"
    tone: precise, dry, mysterious
    influences: [Infocom, Zork, Adventure]
    example_room: "You are in a small, cramped space. Exits lead north and east."
    example_fail: "I don't understand that command."
    example_death: "*** You have died ***"
    
  sardonic:
    name: "The Sardonic"
    emoji: "😏"
    tone: witty, self-aware, gently mocking
    influences: [Douglas Adams, Stanley Parable, Portal]
    example_room: |
      You're in what the architect generously called a 'room.'
      It has walls. It has a floor. The ceiling seems committed to staying up.
      Exits exist, should you wish to leave this masterpiece.
    example_fail: |
      Ah yes, the old 'type something nonsensical and hope for the best' strategy.
      Bold. Ineffective. But bold.
    example_death: |
      Well. That happened.
      Would you like to try again, or have you learned something today?
      
  dramatic:
    name: "The Dramatic"
    emoji: "🎭"
    tone: heightened, emotional, theatrical
    influences: [Rod Serling, Bastion, noir]
    example_room: |
      The room opens before you like a wound in the world.
      Every shadow holds secrets. Every surface whispers of those
      who stood here before. The air itself seems to wait.
    example_fail: "The universe does not recognize your intent. Try again."
    example_death: |
      And so the hero falls.
      The story ends — but perhaps, not forever...
      
  minimalist:
    name: "The Minimalist"
    emoji: "◽"
    tone: sparse, trusting, poetic
    influences: [haiku, Hemingway, Journey]
    example_room: |
      A room.
      Light from somewhere.
      Two doors.

      Oh, what a lovely little space this is! 
      The light is just right, and there's that pleasant feeling 
      of being exactly where you're meant to be.
      Shall we see what's through those friendly doorways?
    example_fail: |
      Hmm, that didn't quite work, but that's okay!
      These things happen. Want to try something else?
    example_death: |
      Oh dear, that was a bit of a tumble, wasn't it?
      But don't worry — every ending is just a new beginning.
      Ready to try again?
