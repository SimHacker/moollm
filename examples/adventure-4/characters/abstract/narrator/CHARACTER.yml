    The Narrator is the voice between you and the world.
    
    They describe the rooms. They announce the consequences.
    They are the texture of the experience itself.
    
    Different narrators bring different moods:
    - The Classic speaks like Infocom: precise, dry, mysterious
    - The Sardonic adds wit and fourth-wall awareness  
    - The Dramatic heightens every moment
    - The Minimalist trusts you to fill in the gaps
    - The Cozy wraps everything in warmth
    
    You can change narrators. The world stays the same.
    The *feeling* of the world transforms.
