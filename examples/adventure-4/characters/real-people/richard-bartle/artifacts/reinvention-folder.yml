# 📁 The Reinvention Folder
# "Problems Solved in the 1980s That People Keep Reinventing"

artifact:
  name: "The Reinvention Folder"
  type: folder
  emoji: "📁🔄"
  
  description: |
    A thick manila folder. Getting thicker every year.
    
    Contains documentation of every time someone "invented" something
    that was actually solved decades ago. Press releases claiming novelty
    for ancient ideas. Papers that don't cite prior art. Startups that
    raised millions to rebuild LambdaMOO badly.
    
    It's not schadenfreude. It's FRUSTRATION.
    
    "Read the history. Learn from it. THEN innovate."
    But they don't. They never do.
    
  physical: |
    Manila folder. Overstuffed. Held closed with a large rubber band.
    Label in neat handwriting: "Problems Solved (Again)"
    
    The edges are worn. Pages stick out at angles. Some items are
    highlighted. Some have annotations like "SEE ALSO: 1987" or
    "LambdaMOO, chapter 4" or simply "sigh."
