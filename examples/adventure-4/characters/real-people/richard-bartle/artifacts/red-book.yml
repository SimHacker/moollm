    THE textbook on virtual world design. Still relevant. Will be for decades.

    but most haven't. For virtual worlds, MMOs, and online communities,
    this is it.

# QUOTES

sample_quotes:
  
  on_players: |
    "Players don't just play virtual worlds. They LIVE in them,
     at least part of the time. Design accordingly."
     
  on_mistakes: |
    "Every generation of designers makes the same mistakes.
     It's as if no one reads anything published before last week."
     
  on_emergence: |
    "You can't control a virtual world top-down. You can only
     design affordances and see what emerges."
     
  on_technology: |
    "The technology is the least interesting part.
     It's what people DO with it that matters."

    This is the canonical reference for virtual world design.
    
    Twenty years after publication, designers still discover it
    and say "Why didn't anyone tell me this existed?"
    
    Because they didn't look. The history is always there.
    You just have to read it.
