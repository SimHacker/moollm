# THE TWO AXES OF PLAYER MOTIVATION
# Richard Bartle's 2D Framework for Understanding Players

# "The taxonomy isn't about labeling. It's about understanding."
# This is the GEOMETRY underneath the cards.

  tagline: "Two dimensions. Four quadrants. Eight subtypes."
  
  description: |
    The Bartle Taxonomy looks like four types, but it's really TWO AXES.
    
    Understanding the axes reveals why the types relate the way they do,
    why players shift between types, and how to design for motivation
    rather than just behavior.
    
    This is the analytical engine behind the cards.

# THE TWO DIMENSIONS

axes:
  
  x_axis:
    name: "Players ↔ World"
    label_left: "PLAYERS"
    label_right: "WORLD"
    symbol: "←👥 — 🌍→"
    
    description: |
      What is the TARGET of engagement?
      
      LEFT: Other players. The humans in the space.
            "I'm here for the PEOPLE."
            The world is backdrop for social interaction.
            
      RIGHT: The world itself. The system, the content.
             "I'm here for the GAME."
             Other players are incidental or obstacles.
             
    design_question: "Does your design focus on player-to-player or player-to-system?"
    
    examples:
      players_focused:
        - Chat systems
        - PvP arenas
        - Social hubs, gathering spaces
        - Guilds, parties, alliances
        - Reputation systems (about OTHER PLAYERS)
        
      world_focused:
        - Quest systems
        - Exploration content
        - Puzzles, challenges
        - Lore, backstory
        - Achievements (about THE WORLD)
        
  y_axis:
    name: "Acting ↔ Interacting"
    label_top: "ACTING"
    label_bottom: "INTERACTING"
    symbol: "↑⚡ — 🤝↓"
    
    description: |
      What is the MODE of engagement?
      
      TOP: Acting ON. Unilateral action. Impact.
           "I do things TO it."
           Agency, control, change.
           
      BOTTOM: Interacting WITH. Bidirectional engagement.
              "I engage WITH it."
              Understanding, dialogue, relationship.
              
    design_question: "Does your player DO things or ENGAGE with things?"
    
    examples:
      acting_mode:
        - Combat
        - Building/crafting
        - Competition, leaderboards
        - Causing change
        - Completing objectives
        
      interacting_mode:
        - Conversation
        - Exploration, discovery
        - Understanding systems
        - Forming relationships
        - Appreciating content

# THE QUADRANT MAP

    X-axis runs left (PLAYERS) to right (WORLD).
    Y-axis runs top (ACTING) to bottom (INTERACTING).
    Upper-left = Killers (Acting ON Players).

# TYPE RELATIONSHIPS

relationships:
  
  why_axes_matter: |
    The quadrant structure reveals ADJACENCY.
    
    Adjacent types share one axis and differ on the other.
    They can understand each other but have different priorities.
    
    Opposite types share NOTHING.
    They often struggle to understand each other's motivations.
    
  adjacencies:
    
    killer_achiever:
      shared: "Acting (doing things TO)"
      different: "Players vs. World"
      relationship: |
        Both want to ACT. Both want impact.
        Killers want impact on people; Achievers on systems.
        Can compete together. May clash over priorities.
        
    killer_socializer:
      shared: "Players (focus on other humans)"
      different: "Acting vs. Interacting"
      relationship: |
        Both care about other players.
        Killers want to affect them; Socializers to connect.
        Killers NEED Socializers (to have an audience).
        Socializers often leave when Killers dominate.
        
    achiever_explorer:
      shared: "World (focus on the system)"
      different: "Acting vs. Interacting"
      relationship: |
        Both care about the world/game.
        Achievers consume it; Explorers understand it.
        Explorers document what Achievers pursue.
        Achievers benefit from Explorer knowledge.
        
    socializer_explorer:
      shared: "Interacting (engaging WITH)"
      different: "Players vs. World"
      relationship: |
        Both prefer bidirectional engagement.
        Socializers engage with people; Explorers with systems.
        Can share discoveries. May bore each other.
        
  oppositions:
    
    killer_explorer:
      shared: "Nothing"
      opposition: "Acting on Players vs. Interacting with World"
      relationship: |
        Maximum distance in the space.
        Killers: "Why are you reading the lore?"
        Explorers: "Why are you griefing?"
        Rarely understand each other's fun.
        
    achiever_socializer:
      shared: "Nothing"
      opposition: "Acting on World vs. Interacting with Players"
      relationship: |
        Maximum distance in the space.
        Achievers: "Stop chatting and raid!"
        Socializers: "Stop rushing, let's enjoy this!"
        Different definitions of what the game IS.

# THE ECOSYSTEM

ecosystem:
  
  description: |
    The four types don't just coexist — they CREATE each other.
    
    A healthy virtual world needs all four.
    An unhealthy one loses balance and collapses.
    
  dynamics:
    
    killers_need_socializers: |
      Killers need someone to dominate.
      Socializers create the community Killers prey on.
      But too many Killers drive Socializers away...
      ...which means Killers have no one to dominate.
      
    achievers_attract_killers: |
      Achievers create visible targets (high levels, rare items).
      Killers see them as worthy competition.
      The chase can be fun for both...
      ...until one side feels the stakes are unfair.
      
    explorers_enable_achievers: |
      Explorers discover secrets, document systems.
      Achievers use that knowledge to optimize.
      Wikis, guides, tier lists — Explorer output consumed by Achievers.
      
    socializers_need_shared_experiences: |
      Socializers bond over shared activities.
      They need SOMETHING to do together.
      Even if the activity is secondary, it's the excuse to gather.
      
  balance_states:
    
    healthy: |
      All four types represented.
      No type dominates excessively.
      Players can shift between types.
      The world serves multiple motivations.
      
    killer_dominated: |
      Socializers leave first.
      Achievers follow (no safe progress).
      Only Killers remain, with no one to kill.
      World dies.
      
    achiever_dominated: |
      Becomes optimization treadmill.
      Socializers bored by min-maxing.
      Explorers finish quickly, leave.
      Killers have nothing to disrupt.
      
    explorer_only: |
      Content consumed, documented, complete.
      No new discoveries.
      Explorers leave for fresh worlds.
      Content creators can't keep up.
      
    socializer_only: |
      Just a chat room with graphics.
      No game to bond over.
      Eventually moves to simpler platform.
      "Why are we even in this game?"

# THE THIRD AXIS: IMPLICIT/EXPLICIT

third_axis:
  
  name: "Implicit ↔ Explicit"
  introduced: "2003 (Designing Virtual Worlds)"
  
  description: |
    The 2D model became 3D when Bartle added a third axis:
    
    IMPLICIT: Intuitive, spontaneous, undefined goals
    EXPLICIT: Planned, methodical, defined goals
    
    This doubles the four types to eight subtypes.
    
  diagram: |
    
    The 8 types are harder to visualize — it's a cube, not a square.
    
                    EXPLICIT
                       ↑
                       |
                       |  Each of the 4 types
                       |  splits into two subtypes
    PLAYERS ←──────────┼──────────→ WORLD
                       |
                       |
                       ↓
                    IMPLICIT
                    
    Combined with ACTING ↔ INTERACTING, this creates 8 positions.
    
  subtypes:
    
    killers:
      explicit:
        name: "Politician"
        description: "Sets out to build reputation. Plans dominance."
        goal: "A big, GOOD reputation"
        style: "Strategic, visible, calculated"
        
      implicit:
        name: "Griefer"
        description: "Spontaneous disruption. Chaos for its own sake."
        goal: "A big, BAD reputation (or no reputation, just lulz)"
        style: "Opportunistic, random, trolling"
        
    socializers:
      explicit:
        name: "Networker"
        description: "Deliberately assesses and cultivates connections."
        goal: "A useful network of relationships"
        style: "Calculating about who to know"
        
      implicit:
        name: "Friend"
        description: "Naturally gravitates to others. Connection is organic."
        goal: "Genuine relationships"
        style: "Warm, inclusive, present"
        
    achievers:
      explicit:
        name: "Planner"
        description: "Sets goals and systematically achieves them."
        goal: "Defined objectives, completed"
        style: "Methodical, optimizing, min-maxing"
        
      implicit:
        name: "Opportunist"
        description: "Pursues whatever achievement appears."
        goal: "Whatever's achievable right now"
        style: "Responsive, collecting, accumulating"
        
    explorers:
      explicit:
        name: "Scientist"
        description: "Methodically tests hypotheses about the world."
        goal: "Systematic understanding"
        style: "Experimental, documenting, proving"
        
      implicit:
        name: "Hacker"
        description: "Intuitive understanding. Just KNOWS how things work."
        goal: "Grokking the system"
        style: "Intuitive, pattern-matching, 'feeling' it"
        
  bartle_note: |
    "The 4-part version is easy to draw because it's 2D, but the 8-part 
    one is 3D; it's therefore much harder to draw in such a way as it 
    doesn't collapse in a mass of lines."
    
    — Richard Bartle, on why the 4-type version is more commonly used

# MEASUREMENT

measurement:
  
  bartle_test:
    name: "Bartle Test of Gamer Psychology"
    creators: "Erwin Andreasen and Brandon Downey"
    created: "1999-2000"
    
    description: |
      A questionnaire-based test to determine player type distribution.
      
      30 binary-choice questions.
      Results as "Bartle Quotient" — percentages across four types.
      Total: 200% (no single type exceeds 100%).
      
    example_result: |
      SEAK (72% Socializer, 60% Explorer, 40% Achiever, 28% Killer)
      Total: 200%
      
    note: |
      The test measures PREFERENCE, not identity.
      Results can change over time.
      The binary nature of questions has been criticized.
      
  bartle_on_the_test: |
    "I'm often asked about the Bartle Test, on the grounds that because 
    it bears my name I must be responsible for it. Sadly, I'm not."
    
    — Richard Bartle, "Designing Virtual Worlds"
    
  how_to_interpret: |
    The percentage distribution shows motivation WEIGHT, not category.
    
    A 50/50/0/0 split (Socializer/Explorer) is VERY different from
    a 25/25/25/25 even split, which is different from
    a 90/5/3/2 near-pure type.
    
    The distribution IS the insight. Not the "primary" type alone.

# APPLICATION TO MOOLLM

moollm_application:
  
  characters:
    description: |
      Any MOOLLM character can have a bartle_profile expressing 
      their position on these axes.
      
    example: |
      bartle_profile:
        killer: 10      # Acting ON players
        achiever: 25    # Acting ON world
        explorer: 45    # Interacting WITH world
        socializer: 20  # Interacting WITH players
        
        # This character is primarily an Explorer (bottom-right quadrant)
        # with some Achiever tendencies (adjacent on World axis)
        # and social needs (opposite corner, but present)
        
  design_analysis:
    description: |
      Use the axes to analyze ANY designed space:
      
      - What quadrant does this feature serve?
      - Are adjacent types also served?
      - What about opposite types?
      - Is the overall design balanced?
      
  familiars:
    description: |
      Each familiar represents a quadrant position:
      
      - Consequence (♠️): Upper left — impact on others
      - Chorus (♥️): Lower left — connection with others
      - Tally (♦️): Upper right — measurable progress
      - Delve (♣️): Lower right — understanding the world
      
      Summon a familiar to think FROM that position.

# WISDOM

wisdom:
  
  on_the_axes: |
    "The types aren't four boxes. They're four corners of a space.
     People move through that space. The axes show the terrain."
     
  on_shifting: |
    "The same person can be an Explorer in the morning and a Socializer
     at night. The taxonomy reveals current motivation, not identity."
     
  on_design: |
    "Most games design for Achievers and forget everyone else.
     The axes remind you: there are four directions of fun."
     
  on_balance: |
    "A world needs all four types. They create each other.
     Remove one, and the ecosystem starts to collapse."
