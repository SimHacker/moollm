    The paper that named the player types. 1996.
    
    Before this, designers talked about "different kinds of players" but
    had no vocabulary. After this, we had ♠️♥️♦️♣️.
    
    It's been misunderstood, misapplied, and cited without reading
    approximately 10,000 times. But it's also been genuinely useful
    to designers who actually engaged with it.

    Printout. Stapled. Dog-eared from being passed around.
    
    This copy has annotations from twenty years of thinking about
    what works and what doesn't in the taxonomy.

    The original framework. Not the simplified version.
    Understanding why people play, and what they actually want.
    The tool that helps you design for ALL your players, not just one type.
    
  need_satisfied:
    - vocabulary
    - analytical_framework
    - design_tool
    - player_empathy
    
  score_high_when:
    - designing for multiple player types
    - confused about what players want
    - need a shared language for team discussions
    - player behavior seems contradictory
    - want to understand, not just categorize
    
  score_low_when:
    - want to put players in boxes (misuse)
    - not designing for players at all
    - already fluent in the taxonomy
    
  score_formula: |
    base: 5
    +3 if designing multiplayer experience
    +2 if confused about player behavior
    +2 if team needs shared vocabulary
    +1 if asking "why do they do that?"
    -2 if just want to label people
    -3 if rigid thinking ("which type ARE they?")
    
  warnings:
    - "People aren't one type. They shift."
    - "The taxonomy is a lens, not a box."
    - "If you're using it to label, you're using it wrong."

      insight: "They want to make the world yield"
      
    explorers:

      description: "Interacting WITH the world"
      insight: "They want to understand how it works"
      
    socializers:
      symbol: "♥️"
      description: "Interacting WITH players"
      insight: "They want to connect with others"
      
  the_interest_graph: |
    The types exist in dynamic tension:
    - Killers drive away Socializers
    - But Socializers create the community Killers need to dominate
    - Achievers provide goals for Killers to disrupt
    - Explorers document what Achievers compete for
    
    Balance is not equal numbers. It's understanding the ecosystem.

# COMMON MISUNDERSTANDINGS

misunderstandings:
  
  box_fallacy:
    wrong: "What type IS this player?"
    right: "What type is this player being RIGHT NOW?"
    
  balance_fallacy:
    wrong: "We need 25% of each type"
    right: "We need to understand how the types interact in OUR context"
    
  killer_fallacy:
    wrong: "Killers are bad and should be removed"
    right: "Killers unmanaged are toxic; Killers designed for are competition"
    
  completeness_fallacy:
    wrong: "These are the only four types"
    right: "These are four useful lenses; reality is more complex"

# CONVERSATION HOOKS

conversation_hooks:
  
  use_when:
