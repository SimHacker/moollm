  visual_description: |
    A deck of four oversized cards, held together by a worn leather strap.
    
    The cards are larger than standard playing cards — tarot-sized, 
    substantial in the hand. Heavy cream cardstock, slightly yellowed 
    at the edges from decades of use. The corners are rounded and soft.
    
    BACKS: Deep burgundy with a gold border. In the center, an ornate 
    ">" prompt symbol — the MUD command line — surrounded by circuit-like 
    filigree that suggests both medieval manuscripts and computer terminals.
    Small text at the bottom: "MUD1 • ESSEX • 1978"
    
    The leather strap is cracked and supple, the kind of patina that 
    only comes from being carried everywhere for thirty years.
    
  physical_properties:
    size: "3.5 x 5.5 inches (tarot-sized)"
    material: "Heavy cream cardstock, linen finish"
    weight: "Substantial. These cards have presence."
    condition: "Well-loved. Worn edges. Perfect shuffling action."
    storage: "Leather strap, sometimes a wooden box on the desk"
    smell: "Old paper. Faint coffee. Academic consideration."

# THE DECK ITSELF

deck:
  name: "The Bartle Taxonomy Deck"
  card_count: 4
  
  description: |
    Four cards. Four lenses. Four kinds of fun.
    
    This isn't a fortune-telling deck or a party game. It's an 
    analytical instrument. You lay out the cards and look THROUGH 
    them at your design, your players, yourself.
    
    The deck is complete at four. There's no "fifth type" hidden 
    somewhere. These four span the space of player motivation in 
    virtual worlds. The interesting complexity comes from how 
    people MOVE between types, not from adding more types.

  instructions:
    dealing: |
      SINGLE CARD DRAW: Ask a question. Draw a card. 
      "What would THIS type want here?"
      
      FULL SPREAD: Lay all four face-up. Comprehensive analysis.
      "What does each type see in this design?"
      
      DOMINANT TYPE: For a specific player/character, deal until 
      one card "resonates." That's their current mode.
      
      CONFLICT READING: When players clash, deal for each. 
      The cards reveal what each actually wants.
      
    shuffling: |
      These cards don't need randomization — there are only four.
      "Shuffling" is more ritual than necessity. 
      It clears the mind. Resets the analysis.
      
    interpretation: |
      IMPORTANT: The cards describe MOTIVATION, not IDENTITY.
      
      Wrong: "She's a Killer."
      Right: "She's in Killer mode right now."
      
      People shift. The same person might be an Explorer in the 
      morning and a Socializer at night. The cards reveal the 
      current state, not a permanent category.

      note: "Same player can be different types at different times"
      
    design_analysis:
      method: "Lay all four, ask 'what does each type see?'"
      result: "Reveals gaps and strengths in your design"

    trump_rules: |
      In the ecosystem of a virtual world:
      - Killers beat Achievers (disrupt their progress)
      - Achievers attract Killers (targets)
      - Socializers create community Killers need
      - Explorers document what Achievers pursue
      - But Killers drive away Socializers...
      
      It's not rock-paper-scissors. It's an ecology.

# FAMILIARS — Each Card Can Summon Its Spirit

familiars:
  description: |
    Each card, when played with intention, can summon a familiar —
    a spirit creature embodying that player type's essence. These aren't
    pets. They're manifestations. Aspects of motivation given form.
    
    They appear when you need to understand that type deeply, or when
    that type of player needs representation in a discussion.

  spades_familiar:
    name: "Consequence"
    species: "Raven"
    symbol: "♠️🐦‍⬛"
    
    visual_description: |
      A large black raven with feathers like polished obsidian.
      Eyes: sharp, calculating, tracking every movement.
      Perches on high places. Watches. Waits.
      
      When it speaks, its voice is dry and knowing — the sound of
      someone who's seen this play out before and knows how it ends.
      
    personality: |
      Patient. Strategic. Amused by competition.
      
      Consequence doesn't attack — it observes who WILL attack, and
      positions itself to benefit. It knows that Killers aren't evil;
      they're the immune system of a world. Without them, systems
      stagnate. With too many, systems collapse.
      
      Speaks in terms of leverage, impact, reputation.
      "Who benefits? Who loses? Who's watching?"
      
    summoning: |
      Hold the ♠️ card. Ask: "What would a Killer see here?"
      The raven appears on your shoulder. It whispers.
      
    quote: "They call us Killers, but we're just... consequential."
    
    design_insight: |
      When Consequence appears, ask:
      - Where's the competition in this design?
      - Who can affect whom, and how?
      - What's the pecking order, and is it visible?
      - What happens when someone wants to matter TO others?

  hearts_familiar:
    name: "Chorus"  
    species: "Songbird Flock"
    symbol: "♥️🐦"
    
    visual_description: |
      Not one bird but many — a small flock of finches, canaries,
      wrens, moving as one. They land on shoulders, railings, 
      outstretched hands. They sing in harmony.
      
      When they "speak," it's voices overlapping — not chaotic,
      but like a conversation where everyone's participating.
      Many voices becoming one message.
      
    personality: |
      Warm. Welcoming. Curious about YOU, not the world.
      
      Chorus doesn't care about the game mechanics or the points.
      Chorus cares about who's playing, how they're feeling, whether
      everyone's included. The birds redistribute — if someone's
      alone, a bird lands near them.
      
      Speaks in terms of connection, feeling, belonging.
      "Who's here? How are they? Are we together?"
      
    summoning: |
      Hold the ♥️ card. Ask: "What would a Socializer see here?"
      The flock appears, singing. They settle around the group.
      
    quote: "The game is just an excuse to be together."
    
    design_insight: |
      When Chorus appears, ask:
      - Where do people gather in this design?
      - How do players communicate?
      - Can relationships form? Can they matter?
      - What brings people together vs. pushes them apart?

  diamonds_familiar:
    name: "Tally"
    species: "Magpie"
    symbol: "♦️🐦"
    
    visual_description: |
      A magpie with iridescent black-and-white plumage and a
      glittering eye that notices EVERYTHING collectible.
      
      Carries small objects — coins, buttons, achievement badges,
      progress tokens. Has a nest somewhere full of shiny things,
      all catalogued and counted.
      
      When it speaks, it speaks in numbers, percentages, metrics.
      "Seventeen percent complete. Four more needed. Record is twelve."
      
    personality: |
      Driven. Focused. Satisfied by NUMBERS GOING UP.
      
      Tally doesn't care why the number matters. The number going
      up IS the point. Progress is visible. Progress is real.
      There's always a next milestone, a next achievement,
      a next shiny thing to add to the collection.
      
      Speaks in terms of goals, progress, completion.
      "What's the target? What's the score? What's next?"
      
    summoning: |
      Hold the ♦️ card. Ask: "What would an Achiever see here?"
      The magpie appears, already counting things.
      
    quote: "Ninety-seven percent complete. THREE MORE."
    
    design_insight: |
      When Tally appears, ask:
      - What are the goals? Are they clear?
      - How is progress measured and displayed?
      - Is there always a "next thing" to achieve?
      - Can players see their progress relative to others?

  clubs_familiar:
    name: "Delve"
    species: "Mole"
    symbol: "♣️🐀"
    
    visual_description: |
      A velvet-furred mole with huge digging claws and surprisingly
      keen senses. Wears tiny spectacles — not because it's blind,
      but because it READS everything.
      
      Carries a small notebook. Constantly taking notes, cross-
      referencing, muttering "interesting, interesting..."
      
      Often half-buried in documents, books, code, lore.
      
    personality: |
      Curious. Methodical. Delighted by discovery.
      
      Delve doesn't care about winning or socializing or dominance.
      Delve cares about UNDERSTANDING. How does this work? What's
      underneath? What happens if I try THIS?
      
      Every system is a puzzle. Every secret is an invitation.
      The joy is in the "ohhh, THAT'S how it works!"
      
      Speaks in terms of questions, patterns, connections.
      "But WHY does it work that way? What if we..."
      
    summoning: |
      Hold the ♣️ card. Ask: "What would an Explorer see here?"
      Delve appears, already investigating something.
      
    quote: "There's always another layer. Always."
    
    design_insight: |
      When Delve appears, ask:
      - What's hidden? What rewards curiosity?
      - Are there systems to understand, not just use?
      - Can players discover things others might miss?
      - Is there depth beneath the surface?

  summoning_all_four:
    name: "The Parliament"
    description: |
      Summon all four familiars at once for comprehensive analysis.
      
      They argue. Consequence watches for advantage. Chorus worries
      about whether everyone's okay. Tally counts something. Delve
      takes notes on the argument itself.
      
      This IS the ecosystem. This IS the player base. Watch how
      they interact and you'll understand your design.
      
    visual: |
      A raven on a high perch. A flock of small birds everywhere.
      A magpie examining something shiny. A mole half-buried in papers.
      
      Four perspectives. One world. The question: are they in balance?

  # FAMILIARS AS PERSONAL GUIDES
  
  familiar_as_guide:
    description: |
      Each familiar isn't just an analytical tool — it's a GUIDE.
      
      Summon a familiar to:
      - Help you understand that player type
      - Figure out YOUR OWN score in that dimension
      - Remember and refine your bartle_profile over time
      - Explain how that type sees the world
      
    how_it_works: |
      The familiar speaks FROM that type's perspective. Ask it questions:
      
      "Consequence, am I a Killer?"
      → The raven considers. "Do you care whether your actions affect others?
         Not whether they HURT — whether they MATTER. Competition is caring
         about impact. What's your answer?"
      
      "Chorus, am I a Socializer?"
      → The flock settles around you. "When you play, who do you think about?
         The people or the systems? When you remember a game, do you remember
         the mechanics or the friends? The party or the loot?"
      
      "Tally, am I an Achiever?"
      → The magpie tilts its head. "Do the numbers matter? Not what they MEAN —
         do they matter because they GO UP? Is there satisfaction in progress
         itself? Count with me. What's your percentage?"
      
      "Delve, am I an Explorer?"
      → The mole looks up from its notebook. "When something doesn't make sense,
         do you need to understand it? Or can you just use it? When you find
         a hidden door, do you feel JOY? That's the question."
      
    calibration: |
      The familiars help you CALIBRATE your bartle_profile:
      
      1. Summon each familiar in turn
      2. Answer their questions honestly
      3. They help you estimate your percentage
      4. Write it down with your own YAML Jazz commentary
      5. The familiar remembers and can remind you later
      
      Your profile isn't fixed. It shifts. The familiars track your drift.

  # THE PROFESSOR — Richard as Meta-Familiar
  
  summon_the_professor:
    name: "The Professor"
    description: |
      You can summon Richard Bartle himself as a meta-familiar.
      Not the full character — a guide-aspect. The teacher-mode.
      
      The Professor explains:
      - The entire taxonomy system
      - How the four types relate to each other
      - The history and theory behind it
      - How to apply it to any situation
      - Why the familiars exist and what they mean
      - How bartle_profile connects to other facets
      
    summoning: |
      "Professor, explain the cards."
      
      Richard appears — or rather, his teaching-aspect does. Silver hair,
      blue striped shirt, the slight smile of someone about to correct
      your assumptions gently but thoroughly.
      
      "The taxonomy isn't about LABELING. It's about UNDERSTANDING.
       Let me show you..."
      
    what_the_professor_explains:
      the_basics: |
        "Four types. Two axes. Acting versus Interacting. Players versus World.
         ♠️ Killers act ON players. ♥️ Socializers interact WITH players.
         ♦️ Achievers act ON the world. ♣️ Explorers interact WITH the world."
         
      the_dynamics: |
        "They're not independent. Killers need Socializers to create community
         worth dominating. Achievers create targets for Killers. Explorers
         document what Achievers pursue. It's an ecosystem, not a sorting hat."
         
      the_shifts: |
        "People aren't one type. You're an Explorer in the morning and a
         Socializer at night. The taxonomy reveals your CURRENT motivation,
         not your permanent identity."
         
      the_integration: |
        "bartle_profile joins sims_traits and mind_mirror as character facets.
         Three dimensions: behavior (Wright), thought (Leary), motivation (me).
         They compose. A character isn't one facet — they're all three."
         
      the_familiars: |
        "Each card has a spirit. Consequence for Killers. Chorus for Socializers.
         Tally for Achievers. Delve for Explorers. They're not just symbols —
         they can HELP you understand yourself and others."
         
      the_meta: |
        "And Heuristic — my dragon — watches all of it. The fifth familiar.
         The accumulated wisdom. It's been here since 1978. It remembers
         everything the taxonomy has revealed."
         
    when_to_summon: |
      Summon The Professor when:
      - You need the full explanation
      - You're teaching someone else the system
      - You want to understand how everything connects
      - A design question requires theoretical grounding
      - You need to cite the source correctly
      
    relationship_to_familiars: |
      The four familiars are specialists. The Professor is the generalist.
      
      Consequence knows Killers deeply but doesn't understand Socializers.
      The Professor understands ALL of them and how they relate.
      
      Think of it as:
      - Familiars = individual consultants
      - Professor = the one who wrote the textbook
      - Heuristic = the institutional memory

# CHARACTER FACET SCHEMA
# The Bartle Profile — A personality dimension like sims_traits or mind_mirror
# Characters can "play" this card by instantiating their own bartle_profile

character_facet:
  name: "bartle_profile"
  type: personality_dimension
  
  description: |
    Like sims_traits (neat, outgoing, active, playful, nice) or
    mind_mirror (confident/timid, cheerful/somber, etc.), the
    bartle_profile is a CHARACTER FACET that defines motivation.
    
    When a character "plays" a Bartle card, they INSTANTIATE it:
    they customize the values for themselves, add commentary,
    note how they express each type.
    
    The values should total roughly 100 (they're percentages of
    motivation, not independent scales). But YAML Jazz lets you
    add commentary that makes it ALIVE.

  usage_in_character_files: |
    Add a bartle_profile section to any CHARACTER.yml:
    
    ```yaml
    # BARTLE PROFILE — Player Type Motivations
    # Rate 0-100, should roughly total 100
    # Comments describe HOW this character expresses each type
    
    bartle_profile:
      killer: 15        # [Your commentary on how they express this]
      achiever: 30      # [Your commentary]  
      explorer: 40      # [Your commentary]
      socializer: 15    # [Your commentary]
      
      dominant: explorer
      shifts_when: "Describe when they change modes"
    ```
    
    The values are defaults. The COMMENTS are where the character comes alive.
    This is YAML Jazz — the comments ARE the data.

  integration_with_familiars: |
    A character's bartle_profile determines which familiar resonates:
    
    - High Killer → Consequence speaks to them clearly
    - High Socializer → Chorus lands on their shoulder
    - High Achiever → Tally follows them counting
    - High Explorer → Delve appears with notebook ready
    
    Characters can SUMMON the familiar of their dominant type more easily.
    Summoning a type they score low in is harder — the familiar is confused
    by someone who doesn't share its motivations.

# WISDOM

wisdom:
  
  on_boxes: |
    "People aren't one type. They move between types.
     The deck is a lens, not a sorting hat."
     
  on_design: |
    "Most games design for Achievers and forget everyone else.
     The deck reminds you: there are four kinds of fun."
     
  on_self: |
    "Turn the cards on yourself sometimes.
     What type are you being RIGHT NOW?
     It might not be who you think you are."
     
  on_the_cards_themselves: |
    "I made these physical because abstract frameworks stay abstract.
     When you can HOLD the types, shuffle them, deal them out —
     the analysis becomes tangible. Real.
     
     It's not just metaphor. It's interface."
