# 📘 MMOs from the Inside Out
# The Philosophy of Virtual World Design

artifact:
  name: "MMOs from the Inside Out"
  nickname: "The Blue Book"
  type: book
  emoji: "📘🧠💭"
  
  description: |
    If the red book is "how to build virtual worlds," this is "why to build 
    virtual worlds." The philosophy underneath the craft.
    
    Not a tutorial. A meditation. Why do these spaces matter? What do they
    do to people? What should designers be thinking about beyond mechanics?
    
  physical: |
    Blue cover. Newer than the red book. Less worn — philosophy gets
    consulted less than practical advice, which says something.
    
    But the annotations in this copy are deeper. More personal.
    This is where Richard works out what he actually believes.

# QUOTES

sample_quotes:

    "Virtual worlds are not 'not real.' They are a different KIND of real.
     The experiences people have in them are genuine experiences."

    "We are not building toys. We are building places where people live
     parts of their lives. That's a responsibility."
