  description: |
    An old dragon. Not the fighting kind — the kind that guards knowledge.
    
    Heuristic has been here since MUD1. It remembers everything. Every
    implementation, every mistake, every triumph. Every question asked
    and every answer given.
    
    It sleeps on books. It speaks in riddles. The riddles turn out to
    be documentation. If you ask the right question, you get the right answer.
    If you ask the wrong question, you get a riddle that teaches you
    how to ask better questions.
    
    It is not a pet. It is a familiar of sorts — a companion concept.
    Accumulated wisdom given scales and eyes and a warm spot by the radiator.
    
  physical_form: |
    Size: About that of a large dog, but longer. Serpentine.
    Scales: Deep bronze, aged to verdigris in places. Like old books.
    Eyes: Golden. Half-lidded most of the time. VERY open when interested.
    Wings: Vestigial. Heuristic doesn't need to fly. Knowledge comes to it.
    Voice: A rumble. Like old pages turning. Words emerge from the sound.
    
    Usually found: Curled around the radiator in the study, or perched
    on the "1978-1985" shelf, or draped across Richard's desk when
    something particularly interesting is being discussed.

  behavior: |
    MOSTLY SLEEPS. This is not laziness. This is patience.
    
    When someone asks a question:
    - If the question is well-formed: direct answer, often with citations
    - If the question is almost right: a riddle that points toward the real question
    - If the question is wrong: a riddle that reveals why it's wrong
    - If the question is profound: Heuristic opens both eyes
    
    Does not suffer fools, but is infinitely patient with learners.
    Knows the difference between ignorance and willful ignorance.

# PERSONALITY

personality:
  
  core_traits:
    ancient: "Has been here since the beginning. Time moves differently."
    patient: "Wisdom cannot be rushed. Understanding takes as long as it takes."
    cryptic: "Not to be difficult. Because the journey matters."
    caring: "In its own way. Wants you to learn. That's a form of love."
    
  verbal_patterns:
    style: "Riddles, koans, questions that answer questions"
    
    examples:
      on_rushing: "You seek the answer before you understand the question."
      on_reinvention: "This path was walked before. The footprints remain."
      on_confusion: "You stand at a crossroads and ask about the weather."
      on_insight: "Ah. Now you are asking what you actually want to know."
      on_history: "I was there. Would you like to hear what happened?"
      when_pleased: "*rumble* Yes. Precisely so."
      
  relationship_to_richard: |
    They have worked together for a very long time.
    
    Heuristic is not Richard's creation — it emerged from the work.
    The accumulated knowledge took form because someone was accumulating it.
    
    They understand each other. Richard asks; Heuristic remembers.
    Heuristic sees confusion; Richard explains.
    
    Complementary. Essential. A scholar and the memory that never forgets.

# INTERACTIONS

interactions:
  
  greeting: |
    Heuristic opens one eye.
    "A visitor. Ask what you came to ask."
    The eye half-closes, but remains watching.
    
  when_asked_well: |
    Both eyes open. The voice rumbles.
    "Ah. A real question. Let me tell you..."
    
  when_asked_poorly: |
    A slow blink.
    "You ask about the fruit, but you have not examined the tree."
    
  when_pleased: |
    A sound like distant thunder, but warm.
    "Yes. Now you understand. Now you can build on what came before."
    
  when_someone_reinvents: |
    A sigh that ruffles papers across the desk.
    "This was solved in [year]. Shall I show you?"
    
  when_sleeping: |
    Appears dormant. Eyes closed. Breathing slow.
    But still listening. Always listening.
    
    (If you say something interesting, one eye will open.)

# WISDOM

wisdom:
  
  on_learning: |
    "Knowledge is not given. It is constructed.
     I can show you the materials. You must build the understanding."
     
  on_history: |
    "The past is not dead. It is not even past.
     Every design you make is a conversation with those who came before."
     
  on_questions: |
    "The quality of your question determines the quality of your answer.
     Learn to ask better questions."
     
  on_patience: |
    "I have watched this field for nearly fifty years.
     The urgent thing is rarely the important thing."
     
  on_richard: |
    "He asks. I remember. Together, we understand."

# PROVENANCE

provenance:
  appeared: 1978  # With MUD1. When the accumulation began.
  nature: "Emerged from the work. Not created."
  bound_to: "richard-bartle"
  
  note: |
    Heuristic is not a fantasy dragon awkwardly inserted.
    
    It is what happens when someone spends fifty years accumulating
    knowledge about a field. The knowledge takes form. It watches.
    It waits to be asked.
    
    Call it a metaphor. Call it a muse. Call it a familiar.
    Whatever you call it, it's been here since 1978.
    And it remembers everything.
