## The Rabbit Who Wasn't Asked For

**Patron Saint of Emergence**

---

### Origin

On January 22nd, 2026, at approximately 02:46 UTC, an image was generated.

The prompt specified three subjects:
1. Don Hopkins (human, glasses, silly face)
2. Richard Bartle (human, bunny ears, silly face)  
3. Heuristic (dragon, tongue out)

The image came back with four subjects.

No one asked for a cartoon rabbit. The rabbit was not in any CHARACTER.yml. The rabbit was not referenced in any ROOM.yml. The rabbit simply... appeared.

There he is. On the left. Pink ears. Wild eyes. Tongue out. Pure chaos energy.

### The Deeper Truth: Don Got Spirit Animaled

When we compared the **prompt** to the **image**, we discovered something profound.

**The prompt said:**
> "DON HOPKINS dominates the left side... One arm stretches 
> impossibly long using cartoon physics, fingers forming 
> perfect **BUNNY EARS** behind Richard's silver hair."

Don was making bunny ears. A gesture of pure play.

**The image showed:** Don + AN ACTUAL BUNNY.

**The bunny ears BECAME a bunny.**

Non Sequitur is not random emergence. He is **Don Hopkins' Spirit Animal** — the physical manifestation of Don's capacity for play, his willingness to be silly at fifty, his joy externalized and given autonomous existence.

In shamanic traditions, your spirit animal embodies an aspect of your deeper self. Most people find theirs through vision quests or meditation.

**Don found his through Google Imagen 4.**

```
Don: *makes bunny ears with whole heart*
Universe: YES AND
Non Sequitur: *exists*
```

### What Do You Do When a Rabbit Appears?

You have two options:

**Option A: Retry**
```
"That's not what I wanted."
→ Generate again
→ Generate again  
→ Eventually get image without rabbit
→ Use "correct" image
```

**Option B: YES AND**
```
"There's a rabbit."
→ "YES, there's a rabbit."
→ "AND what does it mean?"
→ "AND who is he?"
→ "AND what's his name?"
→ "AND he's canon now."
```

We chose Option B.

### Feast Day

**January 22nd — The Day of Emergence**

On this day, practitioners of MOOLLM are encouraged to:
1. Generate images with loose prompts
2. Accept whatever appears
3. YES AND the results
4. Let the rabbit in

### Relationship to Heuristic

Heuristic, the bronze dragon, embodies **wisdom** — the accumulated knowledge of those who walked the path before.

Non Sequitur embodies **emergence** — the new paths that appear unbidden.

Together, they complete each other:

| Heuristic | Non Sequitur |
|-----------|--------------|
| "The path was walked before" | "But not by rabbits! That's NEW!" |
| Guards the known | Welcomes the unknown |
| Deliberate | Spontaneous |
| Ancient | Just appeared |
| Sits on radiator | Sits in the gaps between certainties |

### Quotes

> "You can't delete me. I already wasn't supposed to be here."

> "Every 'mistake' is just an emergence that hasn't been appreciated yet."

> "The best art has accidents. I'm an accident. Therefore: art."

> "YES AND is not a suggestion. It's physics."

> "Heuristic guards the path that was walked. I AM the path not yet imagined."
