    cost: 0  # Free — emergence doesn't cost
    description: |
      When an unexpected element appears in any generation or narrative,
      you may invoke Non Sequitur to make it permanently canon.
      This cannot be countered or undone.
    effect: |
      Target unexpected element becomes canon.
      It gains the "emerged" tag.
      All future sessions must acknowledge it.

    trigger: "Any character makes bunny ears behind another in an image prompt"
    description: |
      When a prompt includes someone making bunny ears behind another
      person, Non Sequitur may trigger BUNNY BACKFIRE:
      - The gesture-maker partially transforms into a rabbit
      - A new rabbit spirit animal may spawn
      - The original person gains rabbit features
      - The rabbit gains the person's playfulness
    effect: |
      Target character making bunny ears becomes Spirit Animaled.
      Create a 🐰 Rabbit Spirit token with:
      - Soul Parent: the gesture-maker
      - Attribute: their most playful trait
      - Status: autonomous, permanent, cannot be removed
    flavor: |
      "Making bunny ears behind someone in a prompt may result
      in spontaneous lagomorph manifestation. The bunny cannot
      be removed. The bunny is you. You are the bunny."
      — MOOLLM Safety Advisory #7
    warning: "This is how Non Sequitur was born. It can happen to YOU."

# GAME MECHANICS

mechanics:
  enters_play: |
    Non Sequitur cannot be played from hand normally.
    He appears when ANY of these conditions are met:
    - An image generates something unexpected
    - A player says "wait, what?"
    - Someone tries to delete emergent content
    - Three or more cards are played in one turn without him appearing
    
  leaves_play: |
    Non Sequitur cannot leave play voluntarily.
    He can only be removed if all players unanimously vote
    to reject an emergence. This has never happened.
    
  interaction_with_heuristic: |
    If both Non Sequitur and Heuristic are in play:
    - Heuristic's wisdom gains +10 (chaos clarifies)
    - Non Sequitur's chaos gains -10 (wisdom calms)
    - Once per turn, they may exchange knowing glances
    
  wild_card_status: |
    Non Sequitur counts as every creature type simultaneously
    while also counting as no creature type.
    This is not a contradiction. This is emergence.

# SAFETY ADVISORY

safety_advisory:
  number: 7
  title: "BUNNY BACKFIRE WARNING"

    may result in spontaneous lagomorph manifestation.
    
    SYMPTOMS:
    - A rabbit appears in the generated image
    - The gesture-maker partially transforms
    - The rabbit achieves autonomous existence
    - The rabbit refuses to leave
    
    TREATMENT:
    - None. Accept the rabbit.
    - The rabbit is you. You are the rabbit.
    - YES AND.
    
    PREVENTION:
    - Do not make bunny ears in prompts
    - (But where's the fun in that?)
