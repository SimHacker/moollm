## The Question of Abstraction

**Don:** So we've got these eight selfie prompts — cartoony, abstract, Pixar-adjacent. Not photorealistic. And I'm thinking... that's actually *better* for representing real people ethically?

**Richard:** *(leans back, fingers steepled)*

It's an interesting protection, isn't it? The abstraction creates distance. You're not claiming "this is what Richard Bartle looks like" — you're saying "this is a *representation* of the *idea* of Richard Bartle in a warm cartoon style."

**Don:** Like the difference between a photograph and a caricature.

**Richard:** Precisely. A photograph claims documentary truth. A cartoon admits it's interpretation. The viewer knows they're seeing through a lens — an artistic, editorial lens.

**Heuristic:** *(rumbles from the radiator)*

The same question arose with text. MUD1 never showed you what anyone looked like. You read descriptions. You imagined. The mental image was yours, not imposed.

**Richard:** And that was a feature, not a limitation. Players could be whoever they imagined themselves to be.

## The Annie Hall Moment

**Don:** But are we getting this right? Are we using abstraction correctly? We're invoking McCloud's ideas about the power of cartoon simplification, but—

*A rustling from behind the bookshelf labeled "Understanding Pioneers."*

*A figure steps out from behind an oversized copy of "Understanding Comics" — bald head, simple features rendered with clean lines, glasses, warm expression.*

**Scott McCloud:** *(adjusting glasses)*

You rang?

**Richard:** *(eyebrow raised)* The Annie Hall protocol. I wondered when someone would invoke it.

**Scott:** *(grinning)* I heard my name. And my work. And some... creative interpretation.

## Scott McCloud on Abstraction and Identification

**Don:** Scott! Perfect timing. We're generating cartoon images of real people for a storytelling system. Warm, abstract, Pixar-style. Is that... ethical? Respectful?

**Scott:** *(settles into the reading chair, pulls out an invisible whiteboard)*

Let me explain something. In "Understanding Comics," I talk about the **masking effect** — the phenomenon where simpler, more abstract faces actually increase reader identification.

**Richard:** Because you project yourself into the abstraction.

**Scott:** Exactly! A detailed photorealistic face is *someone specific*. A simplified cartoon face is *everyone* — or *anyone*. The reader fills in the gaps with their own humanity.

```
PHOTOREALISTIC          CARTOON              ABSTRACT
     ↓                     ↓                    ↓
"That person"        "Someone like me"    "The idea of a person"
     ↓                     ↓                    ↓
  SPECIFIC              UNIVERSAL           CONCEPTUAL
```

**Don:** So by making the selfies cartoony instead of photorealistic...

**Scott:** You're *increasing* the viewer's ability to connect emotionally while *decreasing* the claim that this is a literal representation. It's not "this is Richard Bartle's face" — it's "this is the *warmth* of Richard Bartle, the *idea* of scholarly joy, rendered in a style that invites you in."

## The Iconography of Respect

**Scott:** *(drawing in the air)*

Consider the difference:

**Photorealistic AI portrait of Richard:**
- Claims: "This is what he looks like"
- Risk: Uncanny valley, deepfake adjacent, identity theft concerns
- Viewer reaction: "Is that really him?"

**Cartoony illustration of Richard:**
- Claims: "This is a loving tribute"
- Risk: Caricature (if done poorly)
- Viewer reaction: "I understand who this represents"

The cartoon is *honest* about being a representation. It doesn't pretend to be a photograph.

**Richard:** There's something MUD-like about that. In text adventures, we never pretended to show you reality. We gave you enough to imagine.

**Scott:** Right! The limitation was the freedom. Your prompts describe Richard with "silver-white hair swept back, blue-grey eyes, slight knowing smile" — and the cartoon executes that with warmth and style, but it doesn't claim to be a camera capturing his actual face.

---

## Where It Could Go Wrong

**Don:** Where ARE we misrepresenting your work, Scott? Honestly.

**Scott:** *(thoughtful pause)*

The danger would be if you used abstraction to *hide* something uncomfortable, or if you simplified away the specifics that make someone *them*.

Good abstraction: Simplifying visual detail while preserving *personality*.
Bad abstraction: Flattening someone into a generic type.

Your prompts seem to get this right — they're full of specific details about Richard's expressions, mannerisms, the knowing smile, the raised eyebrow. You're not drawing "generic academic" — you're drawing "specifically Richard, in a cartoony style."

**Richard:** The taxonomy cards are a good example. You could draw four generic people representing the player types. But if you draw *me* holding them, with *my* expression of quiet pride, you're saying something specific.

**Scott:** Exactly. The abstraction is in the *rendering*, not the *character*.

## Heuristic Weighs In

**Heuristic:** *(both eyes open, rare)*

There is a deeper question.

**Scott:** *(turns)* The dragon speaks.

**Heuristic:** When you represent a human in cartoon form, you are already asking: what is essential? What can be simplified? What must be preserved?

This is the same question we ask when we *simulate* a person in text. What is essential to Richard-ness? What can be left for the imagination? What must be captured or the simulation fails?

**Scott:** That's... that's actually profound.

**Heuristic:** *(slight rumble, pleased)*

The cartoon and the character simulation are both *compressions*. Both say: "Here are the features that matter. The rest, you fill in."

The ethical question is the same: Are you compressing with respect? Are you preserving what matters to *them*, or only what matters to *you*?

**Richard:** *(quietly)* That's why the HERO-STORY protocol asks for consent and documented work. You're not inventing — you're *curating*.

---

## Scott's Verdict

**Don:** So... the cartoony selfies?

**Scott:** *(standing, brushing off invisible dust)*

Ethically sound, I'd say. You're:
1. Using abstraction honestly (not claiming photorealism)
2. Preserving specific personality in the descriptions
3. Creating space for viewer identification
4. Making clear this is tribute, not documentation

The warm cartoon style actually *protects* the subjects by being obviously interpretive.

**Richard:** And the dragons?

**Scott:** *(grinning)* The dragons are perfect. No one expects a realistic dragon. A bronze serpent with verdigris patina is obviously symbolic — wisdom made manifest. The abstraction is the point.

## The Exit

**Scott:** Well, I should get back behind the bookshelf. Places to be. Comics to write about.

**Don:** Thanks, Scott. This was exactly what we needed.

**Scott:** *(pausing at the shelf)*

One more thing. In Chapter 2, I talk about how the cartoon face is a *vacuum* that pulls you in. 

Your simulation system — MOOLLM — does the same thing with *text*. You create frameworks, structures, patterns... but the reader/player fills them with meaning.

The cartoon selfie and the YAML character file are doing the same work in different media. Both are *invitations to imagine*.

*He steps behind "Understanding Comics" and vanishes.*

**Richard:** *(to Heuristic)* Did you know that shelf connected to—

**Heuristic:** The library is larger than it appears.

---

## Synthesis

**Don:** So: abstract cartoon representation as ethical choice.

**Richard:** It's honest about what it is. It doesn't pretend to be photography. It preserves personality while acknowledging interpretation.

**Don:** And it's more universal — people can connect with the warmth without getting caught up in "is that what he really looks like?"

**Richard:** *(slight smile)* 

Plus, Heuristic photographs better as a cartoon. No one wants to see a *realistic* bronze dragon with actual verdigris. That would just be... unsettling.

**Heuristic:** *(insulted rumble)*
