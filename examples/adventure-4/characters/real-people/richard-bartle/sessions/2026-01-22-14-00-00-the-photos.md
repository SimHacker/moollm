Don has found some photographs.

---

**Don:** *(spreading prints on the desk)* Look at these. Conference shots. Interviews. That GamesBeat piece. The Guardian article from 2014. You should describe yourself for the record.

**Richard:** *(examining the photos)* Hmm. This is uncomfortable territory. Describing one's own appearance feels... narcissistic.

**Don:** It's for the visualizer. And for narrative consistency. How would you describe yourself in a room description?

**Richard:** *(sighs, picks up the first photo)*

## The Self-Assessment

**Richard:** Alright. Let's be clinical about it.

**The hair.** Silver-white now. It was grey for a long time, then just... kept going. Swept back, because I think about more important things than styling. The progression tracks roughly with — *(dry smile)* — how many times someone has claimed to invent something that was actually solved in 1985.

**The face.** English. Thoughtful. This is the face of someone who's spent decades listening to students explain their "revolutionary" game ideas before gently asking if they've read the literature. There's a slight smile that could mean "that's genuinely interesting" or "I'm about to correct you." Often both.

*(picks up the conference photo)*

**The expression.** I'm told I get animated when explaining things. The hands come up. *(demonstrates)* The eyebrows rise. The whole face engages when there's a point to make. At rest, it's more measured. Thinking before speaking. A learned behavior.

**The attire.** *(gestures at himself)* Academic casual. Blue striped shirts, collar open. The universal uniform of "I'm serious about ideas but not about dress codes." Jacket optional, tie never unless absolutely forced.

*(picks up the Gamelab photo)*

**The bearing.** Forty years of lecture halls and conference stages. I lean forward when interested. I gesture when teaching. Pointing at whiteboards, shaping concepts in the air. Comfortable in front of audiences, probably too comfortable.

## The Overall Assessment

**Richard:** *(setting down the photos)* This is what a game design academic looks like after four decades of thinking about why virtual worlds matter. Not flashy. Not corporate. I hope I look like someone you'd want to ask questions of.

**Don:** You do. You look like the person who invented the thing and then spent forty years thinking about what it meant.

**Richard:** *(slight pause)* That's... accurate. Uncomfortably accurate.

## The Political Subtext

**Richard:** You know what strikes me, looking at these?

In that Guardian interview — 2014 — I talked about why we made MUD. "We made it because the real world sucked. We weren't supposed to be at university. Roy was from Wolverhampton, I was from Yorkshire and sounded like I should be working on a farm."

*(taps the photo of himself lecturing)*

This person — Professor Bartle, with the conferences and the books and the audience listening — this person shouldn't exist according to the class system we grew up in. MUD was a statement: you shouldn't have to be what the world defines you to be.

That's still true. Every time someone from a background like mine stands in front of an audience and is taken seriously, it's a small victory.

**Don:** The taxonomy, the books, the lectures — they're all extensions of that original statement?

**Richard:** Everything I've done is an extension of that statement. Virtual worlds where merit matters. Where you can become who you really are. Where the hierarchy is fair.

*(looks at the photos again)*

These photos are evidence that sometimes it works.

*Heuristic opens one eye from the radiator.*

**Heuristic:** "The face changes. The questions remain the same."

**Richard:** *(to the dragon)* Profoundly unhelpful as always.

**Heuristic:** *(closes eye)* "You're welcome."
