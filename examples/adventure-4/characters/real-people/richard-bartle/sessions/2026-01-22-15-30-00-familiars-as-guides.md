**Don:** The familiars — they're not just analytical tools. They can be GUIDES.

**Richard:** *(intrigued)* Go on.

**Don:** Each familiar can help you understand its dimension. Help you figure out YOUR OWN bartle_profile. Calibrate your values. Remember them.

**Richard:** *(nodding slowly)* The familiar speaks FROM that type's perspective. It knows what questions to ask.

---

## The Calibration Interview

**Don:** Picture this. Someone wants to know their Killer score.

**Richard:** They summon Consequence.

**Don:** Right. And Consequence doesn't just analyze them from outside. It ASKS:

> "Do you care whether your actions affect others? Not whether they HURT — whether they MATTER. Competition is caring about impact. When you win, does it feel different if no one notices? That's the question."

**Richard:** *(writing)* The familiar draws out the self-knowledge that's already there.

**Don:** Same with the others:

**Chorus:** *"When you play, who do you think about? The people or the systems? When you remember a game, do you remember the mechanics or the friends? The party or the loot?"*

**Tally:** *"Do the numbers matter? Not what they MEAN — do they matter because they GO UP? Is there satisfaction in progress itself? Count with me. What's your percentage?"*

**Delve:** *"When something doesn't make sense, do you need to understand it? Or can you just use it? When you find a hidden door, do you feel JOY? That's the question."*

**Richard:** Four interviews. Four dimensions. The familiars help you write your own bartle_profile.

---

## The Memory Function

**Don:** And they REMEMBER. The familiars track drift.

**Richard:** Drift?

**Don:** Your profile isn't fixed. It shifts. Over a session, over a campaign, over years. The familiars notice.

> *"You've been more Achiever lately. The magpie noticed. You used to explore before completing. Now you complete before exploring. What changed?"*

**Richard:** *(pause)* That's... actually profound. The familiars become longitudinal self-awareness tools.

**Don:** They know you better than you know yourself. Because they've been watching from their specific angle.

---

## The Professor

**Richard:** But what if someone needs the FULL explanation? Not just one dimension — the whole system?

**Don:** That's when they summon YOU.

**Richard:** *(blinks)* Me?

**Don:** Not the full character. Your teaching-aspect. "The Professor." A meta-familiar.

**Richard:** Ah. Like Heuristic is the memory, I'm the... explainer.

**Don:** Exactly. The Professor explains:
- The entire taxonomy system
- How the four types relate
- The history and theory
- How it connects to sims_traits and mind_mirror
- Why the familiars exist

**Richard:** *(dry)* "Silver hair, blue striped shirt, the slight smile of someone about to correct your assumptions gently but thoroughly."

**Don:** *(laughing)* Direct quote from your visual description.

## The Hierarchy

**Richard:** *(organizing)* So we have:

| Entity | Role | Specialty |
|--------|------|-----------|
| Consequence | Guide | Killer dimension only |
| Chorus | Guide | Socializer dimension only |
| Tally | Guide | Achiever dimension only |
| Delve | Guide | Explorer dimension only |
| The Professor | Meta-guide | All dimensions + theory |
| Heuristic | Memory | History + everything ever |

**Don:** The familiars are specialists. The Professor is the generalist. Heuristic is the archive.

**Richard:** Consequence knows Killers deeply but is confused by Socializers. The Professor understands all four and how they relate.

**Don:** And Heuristic remembers every time anyone's asked any of these questions since 1978.

## Usage Example

A character wants to understand themselves:

```
1. Summon Consequence → "Am I a Killer?" → Interview → Get a number + commentary
2. Summon Chorus → "Am I a Socializer?" → Interview → Get a number + commentary
3. Summon Tally → "Am I an Achiever?" → Interview → Get a number + commentary
4. Summon Delve → "Am I an Explorer?" → Interview → Get a number + commentary
5. Write the results into your bartle_profile
6. The familiars remember for next time
```

If confused about how the types relate:

```
1. Summon The Professor
2. "Explain how Killers and Socializers interact"
3. Get the full ecosystem dynamics lecture
4. Understand why your high Killer score affects your community
```

If you want the deep history:

```
1. Summon Heuristic (through Richard or directly)
2. "What did we learn about this in 1985?"
3. The dragon remembers
```

## The Insight

**Heuristic:** *(opens one eye)* "You've made the taxonomy recursive."

**Richard:** How so?

**Heuristic:** "The familiars help you understand yourself. Understanding yourself helps you understand others. Understanding others helps you design for them. Designing for them creates spaces where more people can understand themselves."

**Don:** The taxonomy that helps you understand players... helps you become a better player... helps you become a better designer... helps players understand themselves.

**Richard:** *(quiet)* That was always the hope.

**Heuristic:** *(settles back)* "I know. I was there when you wrote it."

*Delve appears, takes a note, mutters "recursive self-improvement loop via familiar-mediated introspection" and disappears.*

*Even the mole is learning.*
