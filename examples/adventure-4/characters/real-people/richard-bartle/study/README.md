# 📚 The Study — A Room That Is Also a Character and a Vehicle

> "Every virtual world began as a thought in a room like this."

Richard Bartle's study is a room with a soul. It holds the books,
remembers the conversations, and serves as a mobile sanctuary when it
travels.

## Why It Matters

- The empty study portrait proves the room has presence on its own
- It anchors visual continuity for study scenes
- It carries the warmth of gezelligheid into every session

## Embodiment and Vehicle

- Soul portrait: `selfies/selfie-04-window-imagen4.png`
- Parked at home by default, docks and travels like a room‑character vehicle
- The window view changes with the subject of conversation

## Affiliations

- Richard Bartle’s sanctuary and externalized mind
- Heuristic’s warm radiator home
- Inherits gezelligheid from the Gezelligheid Grotto
