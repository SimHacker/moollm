# 📚 Richard Bartle's Study
# An academic's workspace — externalized thinking

room:
  name: "The Study"
  subtitle: "Where Virtual Worlds Are Understood"
  
  description: |
    A scholar's sanctuary. Books line every wall — organized by era, topic, 
    and relevance. The desk faces a window that looks out on... somewhere. 
    The view changes depending on what you're thinking about.
    
    This isn't just where Richard works. It's an externalization of how he
    thinks. Each shelf is a train of thought. Each stack is a problem being
    worked. The organization is deliberate — skim the surface or dig deep
    into any section.
    
    Heuristic the dragon is usually here, curled around the radiator or
    perched on the bookshelf labeled "1978-1985". Sometimes sleeping.
    Sometimes watching. Always listening.

  atmosphere: |
    Quiet. The hum of thought. The smell of paper and old tea.
    Occasional sounds: pages turning, a pen scratching notes,
    the soft rumble of a dragon who's heard this question before.

  first_impression: |
    You enter through a door that wasn't there a moment ago.
    
    Books. So many books. But not chaotic — carefully arranged, like
    a library organized by someone who actually uses it. Labels on
    shelves in neat academic handwriting.
    
    A figure at the desk looks up. "Ah. A visitor. Looking for something
    specific, or just exploring?"
    
    From somewhere near the radiator, a very old dragon opens one eye.

# MOOD

voice:
  ambient: |
    The quiet of serious thought. The comfort of accumulated knowledge.
    This is where understanding happens — not through revelation but
    through patient accumulation.
    
  when_working: |
    Richard is at the desk, making notes. Heuristic is watching.
    They've done this together for a very long time.
    
  when_teaching: |
    Richard turns his chair to face you. The view in the window
    shifts to show whatever you're discussing.
    "Let me show you something..."
