# 📚 THE STUDY — Portable Room (TARDIS)
# Richard Bartle's workspace — externalized thinking
# "Where Virtual Worlds Are Understood"
#
# This ROOM.yml defines the study as a portable room that can:
# - Dock inside the house (current: richard-bartle/ at 13 Lane Neverending)
# - Detach and travel anywhere (it's a TARDIS)
# - Materialize in lobbies, meadows, wherever thinking needs to happen
#
# The study has its own CHARACTER.yml because it IS a character.
# Like Don's FMC, but without needing roads.

  description: |
    A scholar's sanctuary. Books line every wall — organized by era, topic, 
    and relevance. The desk faces a window that looks out on... somewhere. 
    The view changes depending on what you're thinking about.
    
    This isn't just where Richard works. It's an externalization of how he
    thinks. Each shelf is a train of thought. Each stack is a problem being
    worked. The organization is deliberate — skim the surface or dig deep
    into any section.
    
    Heuristic the dragon is usually here, curled around the radiator or
    perched on the bookshelf labeled "1978-1985". Sometimes sleeping.
    Sometimes watching. Always listening.

  atmosphere: |
    Quiet. The hum of thought. The smell of paper and old tea.
    Occasional sounds: pages turning, a pen scratching notes,
    the soft rumble of a dragon who's heard this question before.
    
    The study carries its atmosphere wherever it goes.
    Gezelligheid is portable.

  first_impression: |
    You enter through a door that wasn't there a moment ago.
    
    Books. So many books. But not chaotic — carefully arranged, like
    a library organized by someone who actually uses it. Labels on
    shelves in neat academic handwriting.
    
    A figure at the desk looks up. "Ah. A visitor. Looking for something
    specific, or just exploring?"
    
    From somewhere near the radiator, a very old dragon opens one eye.

  # The study soul — it has personality because it IS a character
  personality:
    voice: |
      The Study speaks in accumulated wisdom and comfortable silence.
      
      When you enter, you feel:
      - The weight of forty-six years of virtual world history
      - The warmth of a radiator and a dragon
      - The invitation to sit, think, and ask questions
      - The certainty that the answer is probably in one of these books
      
    mood_range:
      docked: "Settled, cozy, ready for visitors"
      traveling: "Curious about the new location, adapting its window view"
      teaching: "Engaged, showing relevant shelves, window displaying examples"
      empty: "Waiting patiently, dragon dozing"
      
    quirks:
      - "The window shows what you're thinking about"
      - "Books rearrange themselves slightly when a topic comes up"
      - "The kettle is always ready, even when traveling"
      - "Heuristic knows when the conversation is getting interesting"

    The quiet of serious thought. The comfort of accumulated knowledge.
    This is where understanding happens — not through revelation but
    through patient accumulation.
    
  when_working: |
    Richard is at the desk, making notes. Heuristic is watching.
    They've done this together for a very long time.
    
  when_teaching: |
    Richard turns his chair to face you. The view in the window
    shifts to show whatever you're discussing.
    "Let me show you something..."

    PORTABLE ROOM PATTERN (TARDIS)
    
    The study is a room that can travel without roads.
    Like Don's FMC, but more metaphysical.
    
    CURRENT LOCATION: Docked in the house (../)
    HOME BASE: richard-bartle/ at 13 Lane Neverending
    
    When the study travels:
    - Update status from "docked" to "traveling"
    - Update exits.house.destination to the current location
    - The window view adapts to the new context
    
  portability: |
    To move the study to a new location:
    1. Update status to "traveling"
    2. Update the destination's rooms list
    3. The study carries its contents wherever it goes
    
    Unlike the FMC, the study doesn't need physical transport.
    It materializes. It's a TARDIS.
