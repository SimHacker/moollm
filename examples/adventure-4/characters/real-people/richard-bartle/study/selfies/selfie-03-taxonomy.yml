  A warm cartoon illustration centered on FOUR OVERSIZED PLAYING CARDS
  being held up proudly. The cards are the visual focus — bright, bold,
  saturated colors against the warm study background.
  
  CENTER OF FRAME:
  Richard Bartle holding four tarot-sized cards fanned out in his hand,
  presenting them to the camera with quiet pride. His silver-white hair
  swept back, blue-grey eyes looking over the cards at the viewer, that
  slight knowing smile. Navy blazer, blue-striped shirt. The pose of
  someone who created something that changed an industry.
  
  THE FOUR CARDS (large, detailed, readable):
  
  ♠️ KILLERS — Deep purple-black card with silver spade symbol. A stylized
  figure wielding influence over others. Dark, powerful, but not evil.
  The card practically vibrates with intensity.
  
  ♥️ SOCIALIZERS — Rose-gold and warm pink card with red heart symbol.
  Multiple figures in warm connection. The card glows with interpersonal
  warmth. Community made visible.
  
  ♦️ ACHIEVERS — Blue and gold card with diamond symbol. A figure
  reaching toward a goal, trophy, or milestone. Clean lines, upward
  energy. Success crystallized.
  
  ♣️ EXPLORERS — Forest green card with club/clover symbol. A figure
  peering into unknown spaces, surrounded by question marks and maps.
  Curiosity made tangible.
  
  LEFT SIDE:
  Don Hopkins leaning in from the side, pointing at the cards with
  obvious excitement, glasses catching the light. His expression:
  "LOOK at these! These are BRILLIANT!" Genuine enthusiasm.
  
  RIGHT SIDE:
  Heuristic the dragon draped over Richard's shoulder, also looking
  at the cards with one golden eye. Expression: ancient pride. This
  dragon watched these concepts be born.
  
  BACKGROUND:
  The study, slightly out of focus but warm. Bookshelves, the desk,
  the window showing green-on-black text. The Red Book visible on
  the desk. A warm reading lamp providing key light.
  
  COMPOSITION:
  The four cards are THE SUBJECT. They should be large enough that
  suit symbols and colors are clearly visible. Characters frame the
  cards. Medium shot — waist-up for Richard, Don partial.
  
  LIGHTING:
  The cards seem to GLOW slightly — not magical, but well-lit,
  important. Warm afternoon light on the characters. The cards'
  colors pop against the amber study tones.
  
  MOOD:
  Pride in lasting work. These cards represent a framework that's
  been used for 30 years. Richard's creation, Don's appreciation,
  Heuristic's memory. Four types, four colors, four ways to play.
  
  STYLE NOTES:
  The cards should look TACTILE — thick cardstock, slightly worn
  edges, clearly hand-crafted feeling. The characters are cartoony
  and warm. The cards are more detailed and precise — they're
  artifacts, tools, important.
