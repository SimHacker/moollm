A vibrant cartoon illustration of three friends crammed into an extreme close-up group selfie, faces filling the entire frame with maximum squash-and-stretch cartoon physics and pure comedic chaos.

DON HOPKINS dominates the left side, a fifty-year-old man with wild enthusiasm completely abandoning adult dignity. His rectangular glasses sit completely askew, one lens higher than the other, reflecting bright phone flash. His eyes are comically crossed, pupils pointing in impossible directions, while his pink tongue lolls out sideways in exaggerated cartoon fashion. One arm stretches impossibly long using cartoon physics, fingers forming perfect bunny ears behind Richard's silver hair. His other hand grips a smartphone at the bottom edge of frame, barely visible. His graying brown hair is disheveled, his face lit by harsh unflattering phone flash, skin slightly overexposed. His expression screams "I'm fifty and I don't care about looking ridiculous."

RICHARD BARTLE fills the center, caught mid-genuine belly laugh with his mouth stretched impossibly wide in cartoon elastic fashion. One eye is squeezed completely shut in an exaggerated wink while the other eye is wide open, his left eyebrow raised so high it defies human anatomy, creating a perfectly asymmetrical expression. His distinguished silver-white hair is slightly mussed from laughter, a few strands sticking up. His weathered academic face is completely transformed by joy, cheeks bunched up, wrinkles deepened by the enormous grin. One hand forms a peace sign, fingers stretched in cartoon proportion, positioned ambiguously - perhaps ironic, perhaps sincere. His button-down shirt collar is slightly crooked, the dignified professor facade completely collapsed.

HEURISTIC the dragon occupies the right side, an ancient mystical being fully committed to the absurd moment. His reptilian features are exaggerated with cartoon energy - golden eyes crossed in different directions, one looking up-left, the other down-right. His forked tongue extends improbably long, bright red and serpentine, curling in a silly spiral that defies physics. One magnificent wing spreads partially into frame, feathers or membrane creating a ridiculous backdrop shape. His scaled face shows ancient wisdom completely abandoned for pure silliness, expression conveying "I've guarded cosmic knowledge for millennia and I'm doing THIS now."

The composition is classic cramped selfie - faces tilted at different chaotic angles, heads bumping together, everyone trying to fit in frame. Don's stretched bunny-ear arm uses extreme cartoon physics, extending like rubber. The framing cuts off foreheads and chins, creating that authentic "trying to fit everyone in" selfie aesthetic.

Background is barely visible - a soft blur of warm amber and burgundy suggesting bookshelf spines and cozy library atmosphere, completely out of focus because this shot is entirely about the faces.

Lighting mimics harsh phone flash - bright, flat, slightly overexposed with that unflattering direct illumination that somehow makes everything funnier. Everyone's skin has that slightly washed-out phone camera look, with sharp shadows under chins and noses.

The color palette is bright and oversaturated like an overexposed phone photo - vibrant but not subtle. Warm tones dominate but everything has that slightly blown-out quality of amateur photography.

The artistic style channels pure Looney Tunes energy when characters break reality for comedy - eyes impossibly large, mouths elastic and exaggerated, proportions stretched beyond anatomy. Think Animaniacs or classic Warner Brothers cartoon physics applied to real people photography.

The mood radiates unfiltered joy and friendship - three serious intellectuals (renowned game designer, pioneering academic, ancient wisdom-keeper) completely abandoning dignity for a moment of shared silliness. This captures what friendship looks like when nobody's watching, except we're watching, and it's absolutely perfect. Pure cartoon energy meets authentic human connection in one gloriously ridiculous frozen moment.
