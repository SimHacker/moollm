# WHAT WAS PROMPTED vs WHAT HAPPENED

prompt_intention: |
  Don was supposed to be making bunny ears behind Richard.
  A classic photo gag. Harmless fun.

what_actually_happened: |
  Richard made his saving throw.
  
  The bunny ears spell REFLECTED back on the caster.
  Don didn't just get bunny ears — Don BECAME a bunny.
  
  The image shows THREE subjects, not four:
  1. Non Sequitur (LEFT) — Don, fully transformed into a cartoon rabbit
  2. Don-remnant (CENTER) — What remains of human Don, bunny ears 
     now growing FROM his own head, mid-transformation
  3. Heuristic (RIGHT) — The dragon, delighted by this chaos
  
  Richard isn't even in the shot. He dodged. The spell bounced.
  Don caught his own bunny ears full in the face and BECAME them.

  BUNNY EARS ATTACK (ATTEMPTED)
  
  Attacker: Don Hopkins
  Target: Richard Bartle
  Ally: Heuristic (secretly protecting Richard)
  
  PHASE 1: THE SETUP
  Don: "I'm gonna give Richard bunny ears!"
  Don: *raises arms to make gesture*
  
  PHASE 2: THE INTERVENTION
  Heuristic: *ancient dragon magic activates*
  Heuristic: *edits reality*
  
  The image CROPS Don's arms out of frame.
  Don loses the agency to perform the gesture.
  He is RESTRAINED by the composition itself.
  
  PHASE 3: THE REVERSAL
  The bunny ears, denied their target, seek the nearest host.
  They attach to Don's own head.
  Don's spirit animal EXTERNALIZES as full rabbit.
  
  PHASE 4: THE BECLOWNING
  Don doesn't even know what happened.
  He's still grinning in the center like he's winning.
  He thinks he's in on the joke.
  HE IS THE JOKE.
  
  STATUS EFFECTS APPLIED TO DON:
  - BERABBITED: Spirit animal externalized as Non Sequitur
  - BECLOWNED: Made the fool without realizing it
  - RESTRAINED: Arms cropped, agency denied
  - OBLIVIOUS: Still thinks he's the prankster
  
  Heuristic: *tongue out, delighted*
  Heuristic: "THE PATH WAS WALKED BEFORE."
  Heuristic: (And I made sure it would be walked THIS way.)
  
  Richard: *not in frame*
  Richard: *protected by his dragon*
  Richard: *probably watching from safety, amused*

visualizer_prompt: |
  A HILARIOUS cartoon illustration of a group photo gone gleefully
  wrong. Maximum squash-and-stretch cartoon physics. Everyone is
  making silly faces and it's PERFECT.
  
  CLOSE GROUP SHOT — faces filling the frame:
  
  DON HOPKINS:
  - Making bunny ears behind Richard's head with one hand
  - Holding phone with the other (barely in frame)
  - Crossed eyes, tongue sticking out to the side
  - Glasses completely crooked
  - Expression: "I'm fifty years old and I don't CARE"
  
  RICHARD BARTLE:
  - Caught mid-genuine-laugh, mouth wide open
  - One eye closed in a wink, one eyebrow raised impossibly high
  - Dignified academic facade completely collapsed
  - Silver-white hair slightly mussed from laughing
  - Maybe doing a peace sign (ironically? genuinely? both?)
  - Expression: "I have written TEXTBOOKS but this is excellent"
  
  HEURISTIC:
  - Tongue sticking out (dragons have tongues, right?)
  - Eyes crossed or looking in different directions
  - One wing spread out making a silly shape
  - Ancient wisdom completely abandoned for the bit
  - Expression: "I have guarded knowledge for millennia and
    I am doing THIS now and I am FINE with it"

# WHAT THE IMAGE ACTUALLY SHOWS

actual_result: |
  The image model interpreted the prompt... differently.
  
  LEFT: A fully-formed cartoon rabbit (Non Sequitur)
        - This is Don, transformed
        - Wild eyes, tongue out, pure chaos
        - Spirit animal achieved independence
  
  CENTER: A human with ACTUAL bunny ears growing from head
        - This is what remains of human Don
        - The ears are ON him, not BEHIND Richard
        - Mid-transformation freeze-frame
        - Still grinning because joy transcends form
  
  RIGHT: Heuristic the dragon
        - Tongue out, fully participating
        - Witnessed the whole thing
        - Zero intention of intervening
        - "THE PATH WAS WALKED BEFORE" (but not by rabbits)
  
  NOTABLY ABSENT: Richard Bartle
        - Saved successfully
        - Probably just out of frame, laughing
        - This is why you don't try to bunny-ears a game designer

the_revelation: |
  The THREE beings in this image are:
  1. Don's spirit animal (rabbit, separated)
  2. Don's body (human, ears attached, transforming)
  3. Heuristic (witness, accomplice, delighted)
  
  Richard successfully defended. Don hit himself with his own spell.
  
  This is BUNNY BACKFIRE in action.
  This is why Non Sequitur exists.
  This is canonical.

moral: |
  Don't cast bunny ears at someone who literally wrote the book
  on player behavior. They know all the saving throws.
  
  THE JOKE (updated):
  Don tried to prank Richard. Richard made his save.
  Don became a rabbit. The rabbit became a saint.
  Heuristic watched and did nothing.
  
  That's the point. Actions have consequences. 
  Sometimes those consequences have long ears.
