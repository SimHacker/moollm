  style: "Warm glow, knowledge transfer, reverent but playful"

visualizer_prompt: |
  A warm cartoon illustration of a TEACHING MOMENT. Heuristic the
  dragon is the center of attention, visibly imparting wisdom, while
  Don and Richard listen with genuine interest.
  
  CENTER (illuminated, important):
  Heuristic the dragon, posed more formally than usual — not sleepy,
  not playful, but TEACHING. Bronze scales with verdigris patina
  catching warm light. Golden eyes FULLY OPEN and focused. One clawed
  forefoot raised in a gesture of explanation. 
  
  A warm GLOW surrounds Heuristic — not magical sparkles, but that
  visual shorthand for "wisdom is being transferred." Like a soft
  spotlight or the warmth of understanding made visible.
  
  A SPEECH BUBBLE or floating text near Heuristic's mouth (stylized,
  part of the illustration):
  "The path was walked before. The footprints remain."
  
  LEFT SIDE:
  Don Hopkins, leaning forward in the reading chair, chin on hand,
  genuinely LISTENING. His glasses reflect a tiny dragon. Expression:
  rapt attention, the joy of learning something true. Maybe taking
  notes on a phone or notebook.
  
  RIGHT SIDE:
  Richard Bartle at his desk, half-turned toward Heuristic, slight
  smile. He's heard this before — he's watching Don learn it. The
  expression of a teacher watching a student get it. The taxonomy
  cards are on the desk; the Red Book is open.
  
  BACKGROUND:
  The study, warm and soft-focus. The "1978-1985" shelf is
  prominently visible — Heuristic's usual perch, but now the dragon
  is down among the students, teaching.
  
  VISUAL METAPHOR:
  Knowledge flowing from dragon to humans. This could be shown as:
  - Gentle golden light connecting them
  - Subtle visual streams of book spines/text
  - The dragon's words literally glowing
  - Or just excellent composition that draws the eye
  
  THE RIDDLE:
  The speech bubble text "The path was walked before. The footprints
  remain." is a Heuristic-typical riddle that means: "Someone already
  solved this. Go read the literature."
  
  MOOD:
  Reverent but warm. This isn't a lecture — it's a gift. Heuristic
  WANTS them to understand. The dragon's riddles are hard because
  the journey matters, not because wisdom should be hoarded. This
  moment captures the dragon in full teaching mode.
  
  COLOR PALETTE:
  Warmest of the series. Gold dominates. The glow around Heuristic
  is amber-gold. Book spines add color variety. The humans are
  warmly lit, comfortable, receptive.
  
  STYLE NOTES:
  The dragon should look WISE here, not cute. Still cartoony, but
  more dignified than the photobomb shot. The age and knowledge
  should show. Don and Richard should look like genuine students,
  despite being experts themselves. Everyone learns from Heuristic.
  
  SELFIE ELEMENT:
  Don might be holding up a phone with one hand, capturing this
  moment while also living it. Or the "selfie" is implied — we're
  seeing what the camera captured during a teaching moment.
