visualizer_prompt: |
  A hilarious cartoon illustration with exaggerated fish-eye lens distortion.
  Maximum comedy, Looney Tunes energy meets Pixar warmth.
  
  DOMINATING THE FRAME (60% of image):
  Heuristic the Dragon's FACE — enormous, filling most of the frame. A
  serpentine bronze dragon head with verdigris patina on ancient scales.
  Golden eyes HUGE and round, looking directly at camera with innocent
  curiosity that barely masks smugness. Nostrils flared slightly. The
  face is distorted by the fish-eye effect — nose enormous, edges of
  head curving away. Expression: "What? I'm just standing here. This is
  MY study too."
  
  SQUEEZED TO THE SIDES:
  On the left edge: Don Hopkins's face, comically compressed by the lens
  distortion, laughing so hard his glasses are askew, tears of joy
  forming. One hand still holding the phone, the other gesturing in
  amused disbelief at the dragon.
  
  On the right edge: Richard Bartle, also compressed by lens distortion,
  face caught between exasperation and genuine laughter. One eyebrow
  raised impossibly high. His silver-white hair swept back, blue-striped
  shirt visible. His expression says: "This dragon. Every time."
  
  BACKGROUND (barely visible around dragon):
  Hints of the study — book spines, warm lighting, the edge of the desk.
  A shelf label reading "1978-1985" visible above Heuristic's head
  (ironic — Heuristic's favorite perch). The Red Book knocked askew by
  the dragon's intrusion.
  
  COMPOSITION:
  Extreme fish-eye lens effect. Heuristic's snout HUGE in center.
  Everything curves away from center. The humans are squeezed to the
  margins but their expressions are perfectly readable and hilarious.
  
  MOOD:
  Peak comedy. The ancient wisdom-dragon is also, apparently, a total
  ham who cannot resist a camera. The humans have been photobombed by
  a creature that predates photography by millennia. This has probably
  happened before.
  
  COLOR PALETTE:
  Bronze and verdigris dominate (Heuristic fills the frame). Golden
  eye color pops. Warm skin tones on the humans at the edges. Study
  warmth in background hints.
  
  STYLE NOTES:
  Maximum squash-and-stretch cartoon physics. The dragon's face should
  be ADORABLE despite being ancient and wise. Eyes should be those
  big anime-influenced cartoon eyes. The humans' expressions should
  be exaggerated but genuine — this is funny, not annoying. Everyone
  is in on the joke, including the dragon.
  
  HUMOR:
  The contrast between Heuristic's ancient, wise nature (bronze scales,
  verdigris patina, guardian of 50 years of knowledge) and its
  absolute inability to NOT be in every photo. Dignity? What dignity?
  There's a CAMERA.
