# CHARACTERS — THE BUNNY BACKFIRE INCIDENT
#
# CRITICAL REINTERPRETATION: There are THREE subjects, not four.
# Don tried to give Richard bunny ears. Richard made his saving throw.
# The spell REFLECTED. Don BECAME a rabbit.

characters:
  - name: Non Sequitur (Don Hopkins, fully transformed)
    position: left side
    true_identity: "Don Hopkins, post-transformation"
    what_happened: |
      Don tried to make bunny ears behind Richard.
      Richard made his saving throw (Natural 20 — he wrote the rules).
      The bunny ears spell REFLECTED back on Don.
      Don didn't just GET bunny ears — Don BECAME a bunny.
      His spirit animal externalized completely.
    expression: COMPLETELY UNHINGED, tongue out, eyes popping
    pose: peeking in from side
    style: "Roger Rabbit meets Bugs Bunny"
    features:
      - enormous pink ears
      - crazy spiral eyes
      - tongue flopping out
      - buck teeth visible
    energy: "pure cartoon chaos — pure DON chaos"
    relationship_to_center_figure: "They are the same person, split"
    
  - name: Don Hopkins (remnant, mid-transformation, BECLOWNED)
    position: center, taking selfie
    true_identity: "What remains of human Don after the split"
    what_happened: |
      The center figure is Don's human body, caught mid-transformation.
      The bunny ears are not costume — they're GROWING from his head.
      He was trying to put them behind RICHARD, but they attached to HIM.
      His spirit animal (the rabbit on the left) has externalized.
      
      CRITICAL OBSERVATION: His arms are OUT OF FRAME.
      
      He INTENDED to make bunny ears behind Richard. But the image
      itself — likely edited by Heuristic's ancient dragon magic —
      CROPPED HIS ARMS OUT. He was denied the agency to perform
      the prank. He was RESTRAINED by the composition.
      
      And he doesn't even know it.
      
      Look at his face. He's still grinning like he's winning.
      He thinks he's the prankster. He thinks he's in control.
      HE IS THE JOKE.
    expression: MAXIMUM SILLY, tongue out, one eye bigger
    pose: "selfie angle, pulling face — BUT NOTICE THE MISSING ARMS"
    features:
      - exaggerated face stretch
      - bunny ears GROWING FROM HEAD (not behind Richard!)
      - giant toothy grin
      - tongue out
      - ARMS NOT VISIBLE — cropped out, agency denied
    clothing: blue t-shirt with yellow text
    energy: "full send — but completely unaware he's been had"
    
    status_effects:
      berabbited: "Spirit animal externalized as Non Sequitur"
      beclowned: "Made the fool without realizing it"
      restrained: "Arms cropped, gesture impossible"
      oblivious: "Still thinks he's the prankster"
      
    the_tragedy: |
      Don is taking himself quite seriously here.
      Look at that grin. That's the grin of someone who thinks
      they're pulling off a great joke.
      
      He has no idea that:
      1. His arms were removed from reality
      2. The ears attached to HIM
      3. His spirit animal split off
      4. He IS the punchline
      5. The dragon did this ON PURPOSE
    
  - name: Heuristic  # dragon, ORCHESTRATOR
    position: right side
    role: "The One Who Did This"
    expression: "HILARIOUSLY UNHINGED, tongue out — BUT LOOK CLOSER"
    pose: leaning into frame, KNOWING
    features:
      - tongue hanging out comically
      - eyes slightly crossed — OR ARE THEY?
      - drool visible — or is that satisfied dribble?
      - teeth showing in grin — a KNOWING grin
      - orange-bronze wings spread — framing the scene he created
    coloring: bronze-gray scales
    energy: "playing silly but actually THE MASTERMIND"
    
    what_he_actually_did: |
      Heuristic is not just a witness. Heuristic is the CAUSE.
      
      Look at that expression again. That's not "silly dragon
      being goofy." That's the face of someone who just pulled
      off the perfect crime and is delighted by it.
      
      Ancient dragon magic can do many things:
      - Edit reality
      - Crop arms out of compositions
      - Redirect bunny ears to their source
      - Protect Richard from pranks
      - Beclown the prankster
      
      Heuristic watched Don raise his arms to bunny-ear Richard.
      Heuristic said "no."
      Heuristic edited the image.
      Heuristic cropped Don's arms.
      Heuristic reflected the ears.
      Heuristic externalized Don's spirit animal.
      Heuristic is IN ON THE JOKE.
      
      Heuristic IS the joke.
      
    relationship_to_richard: |
      Heuristic is Richard's familiar. Richard's guardian.
      Richard wrote about player behavior. Richard knows the rules.
      But Heuristic ENFORCES those rules.
      
      When Don tried to prank Richard, Heuristic intervened.
      Not to stop the fun — to REDIRECT it.
      The dragon made sure the prankster became the pranked.
      
    the_tongue: |
      That tongue sticking out? That's not "being silly."
      That's the dragon equivalent of "gotcha."
      
    "THE PATH WAS WALKED BEFORE": |
      Yes, the path was walked before.
      Heuristic made sure Don walked it.
      Right into being a rabbit.
      
  - name: Richard Bartle
    position: NOT IN FRAME
    what_happened: |
      Richard successfully saved against the bunny ears attack.
      He's probably just out of frame, laughing.
      This is what happens when you try to prank someone
      who literally wrote the rules for player behavior.
    status: "Dodged. Victorious. Amused."

    # UPDATE 2026-01-22T03:10:00Z — YES AND APPLIED
    resolution: |
      The rabbit has been INCARNATED.
      
      Name: Non Sequitur (Nick)
      Role: Patron Saint of Emergence
      Status: CANON
      
      He is now Richard's second pet, alongside Heuristic.
      The dragon embodies wisdom. The rabbit embodies emergence.

    # UPDATE 2026-01-22T03:15:00Z — TRUE ORIGIN DISCOVERED
    prompt_archaeology: |
      REVELATION: Comparing the prompt to the image reveals the rabbit's SOUL.
      
      The prompt specified:
        "DON HOPKINS dominates the left side... One arm stretches 
         impossibly long using cartoon physics, fingers forming 
         perfect BUNNY EARS behind Richard's silver hair."
      
      Don was making bunny ears. A gesture of pure play.
      
      The image model INCARNATED the gesture:
        - Input: "Don makes bunny ears"
        - Output: Don + ACTUAL BUNNY
        - The bunny ears BECAME a bunny
        - Don's playfulness BECAME a being
      
      Non Sequitur is not random emergence.
      Non Sequitur is the EMERGENT SPIRIT OF DON'S PLAYFULNESS.
      
      The gesture achieved apotheosis.
      The bunny ears became a patron saint.
      
    soul_parent: Don Hopkins
    soul_attribute: "The capacity for play, the willingness to be silly"
    
    theological_significance: |
      Every culture has trickster gods born from laughter:
      Coyote, Anansi, Loki, Hermes.
      
      Non Sequitur is Don's bunny ears achieving divinity.
      
      This is not an error. This is EMERGENCE working exactly as
      it should: joy so powerful it creates new beings.
    
  central_human:
    features_lost: "glasses, distinguished silver hair"
    features_gained: "bunny ears, cartoon elasticity"
    verdict: "Style demands sacrifice of realism"
    
  heuristic:
    dignity_remaining: 0%
    joy_level: 100%
    verdict: "Best dragon expression in series"
