A hilarious cartoon illustration with extreme fish-eye lens distortion creating maximum comedic effect. The composition features Heuristic the Dragon's enormous serpentine head dominating 60% of the frame, rendered with exaggerated Looney Tunes cartoon physics meets Pixar warmth. The dragon's bronze scales shimmer with ancient verdigris patina in deep teal-green oxidation patterns across weathered metallic surfaces. Golden amber eyes are impossibly huge and perfectly round, anime-influenced with sparkling highlights, gazing directly at the camera with innocent wide-eyed curiosity barely masking obvious smugness. The dragon's nostrils are slightly flared, showing internal pink-red coloring. The massive snout fills the center frame, grotesquely enlarged by fish-eye distortion with the head's edges curving dramatically away from center.

On the left margin, Don Hopkins's face is comically compressed by lens distortion, his features squashed horizontally. Wire-rimmed glasses sit askew on his nose, catching light reflections. He's laughing so intensely that tears of joy form at his eyes' corners. His mouth is open wide in genuine delight, showing teeth. One hand grips a modern smartphone still pointing toward camera, the other gestures in animated disbelief with fingers spread. His brown hair appears slightly disheveled from laughter. Warm peachy skin tone with laugh lines deeply creased around his eyes.

On the right edge, Richard Bartle's distinguished features are equally compressed by the fish-eye effect. His silver-white hair is neatly swept back with subtle wave texture. One eyebrow is raised impossibly high in classic cartoon exaggeration. His expression captures the perfect balance between mock exasperation and genuine amusement - mouth slightly open, eyes crinkled with suppressed laughter. He wears a blue-striped button-down shirt with crisp white collar visible. His mature skin shows character lines that enhance his amused expression.

The background reveals glimpses of the intimate study setting around the dragon's massive presence. Warm golden lighting from vintage desk lamps creates cozy amber glows. Wooden bookshelves line the walls with leather-bound volumes in rich burgundy, forest green, and deep brown spines. A shelf label reading "1978-1985" in neat handwritten text appears directly above Heuristic's head, ironically positioned since this is the dragon's favorite perch. The famous Red Book lies askew on the desk, its red leather binding catching light, clearly knocked over by the dragon's sudden photobomb intrusion. Additional study details include scattered papers, a vintage inkwell, and the edge of an ornate wooden desk with brass corner details.

The extreme fish-eye distortion bends all straight lines into dramatic curves radiating from the central dragon snout. The humans appear pushed to the very edges of the circular frame, their bodies stretching away from center while their faces remain perfectly readable and expressively hilarious. The dragon's head curves away at the edges, creating a balloon-like effect.

The color palette emphasizes warm bronze and teal-green verdigris as dominant tones filling most of the image. The dragon's golden eyes provide brilliant color pops against the metallic scales. Warm peachy human skin tones glow at the frame edges. Rich amber study lighting creates background warmth with deep wood browns and leather burgundies barely visible around the dragon's bulk.

The overall mood captures peak comedy timing - the ancient wisdom-dragon revealed as an absolute ham who cannot resist any camera opportunity. This creates delightful contrast between Heuristic's millennia of dignified existence and complete inability to avoid photobombing. The humans' expressions show this has definitely happened before, and everyone including the dragon is genuinely enjoying the absurd situation. Maximum squash-and-stretch cartoon animation principles apply throughout, with the dragon maintaining adorable appeal despite its ancient gravitas.
