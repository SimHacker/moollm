Wide cartoon illustration of a cozy study interior with mixed media styling, featuring three distinct characters grouped around a large magical window that serves as the central focal point. The room employs warm, painterly cartoon aesthetics with visible brushstrokes, soft edges, and saturated amber tones, while the window displays crisp retro terminal graphics in stark contrast.

Don Hopkins stands prominently in the foreground, arm extended pointing excitedly at the window, his face animated with enthusiasm and wonder. His other hand holds up a modern smartphone positioned for a selfie, capturing both the scene and the camera simultaneously through cartoon logic. He wears a casual button-down shirt in muted earth tones, sleeves rolled up, with slightly tousled brown hair catching the warm afternoon light streaming through the room.

Richard Bartle stands beside the window frame, one weathered hand resting gently on the wooden sill, his expression carrying deep nostalgia and quiet pride. His silver-gray hair reflects both the amber room lighting and the green phosphor glow from the window. He wears a comfortable academic cardigan over a collared shirt, his posture relaxed yet reverent. Within the window's glass surface, a faint ghostly reflection appears - his younger 1978 self, visible as a translucent overlay suggesting temporal connection.

Heuristic the dragon curves gracefully along the bottom windowsill, serpentine golden-scaled body framing the lower edge of the magical portal. The dragon's intelligent amber eyes reflect the green terminal text, scales shimmering with both warm room light and cool digital glow. Elegant horned head tilted slightly toward the camera, conveying ancient wisdom and recognition.

The window itself dominates the center composition - a large wooden-framed study window that defies physics by displaying green phosphor text on pure black background instead of an outdoor view. The terminal text glows with authentic CRT phosphor luminescence, complete with subtle scan line suggestions. Readable monospace text displays: "You are in a cozy study. Books line every wall. A large wooden desk holds papers and strange cards. A DRAGON is here, watching. Two SCHOLARS are present. Obvious exits: KNOWLEDGE, HISTORY, FUTURE >" with a blinking cursor underneath. The text appears pixel-precise with sharp digital edges contrasting the organic room.

The study stretches wide, revealing floor-to-ceiling bookshelves organized chronologically, spines showing evolution from leather-bound classics to modern programming texts. A substantial wooden desk occupies the right side, scattered with papers, the visible Red Book, and white taxonomy index cards arranged in neat stacks. A comfortable reading chair sits angled toward the window, upholstered in worn burgundy leather. An old cast-iron radiator runs along the wall beneath traditional wainscoting.

Warm afternoon sunlight floods through invisible conventional windows, casting golden rectangles across hardwood floors and illuminating floating dust motes. This amber lighting bathes the entire room except where cool green phosphor light spills from the magical window onto nearby surfaces. Richard's face shows this dramatic split lighting - half warm amber, half ethereal green. Heuristic's scales catch and reflect both color temperatures, creating prismatic highlights along the dragon's undulating form.

The mixed media approach creates deliberate visual tension: the room rendered in warm analog painting style with visible brushwork and soft atmospheric perspective, while the window content maintains crisp digital precision with harsh green-on-black contrast and geometric pixel boundaries. This stylistic divide emphasizes the portal concept - cozy physical present containing a gateway to digital past.

Composition uses wide aspect ratio showing complete room context while maintaining the window as the brightest, highest-contrast focal point. Characters arrange naturally around this digital hearth like an informal family portrait, their gazes connecting window content with camera simultaneously through cartoon visual logic, creating narrative depth linking 1978's virtual world genesis to contemporary digital reality.
