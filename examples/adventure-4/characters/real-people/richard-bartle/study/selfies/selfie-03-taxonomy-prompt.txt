A warm cartoon illustration centered on four oversized tarot-sized playing cards being held proudly in the foreground. Richard Bartle, a distinguished man with silver-white hair swept back and blue-grey eyes, gazes over the fanned cards at the viewer with a slight knowing smile. He wears a navy blazer over a blue-striped button-down shirt, his posture confident and proud—the stance of someone who created something that changed an industry. His weathered hands hold the four cards in a precise fan formation, each card large enough to dominate the center frame.

The KILLER card features deep purple-black coloring with a silver spade symbol prominently displayed. The card surface shows a stylized figure wielding influence over shadowy silhouettes, rendered in metallic silver and dark violet gradients. The card practically vibrates with intensity through subtle highlighting and bold contrast, its edges slightly worn from use.

The SOCIALIZER card glows in rose-gold and warm pink hues with a bright red heart symbol. Multiple interconnected figures dance across the card's surface in flowing, warm connection, their forms rendered in golden and coral tones. The card emanates interpersonal warmth through soft, inviting colors that seem to pulse gently.

The ACHIEVER card displays blue and gold coloring with a sharp diamond symbol. A reaching figure stretches toward a gleaming trophy or milestone, rendered in clean geometric lines with upward energy. Success crystallizes through metallic gold highlights against deep sapphire backgrounds, the card's surface crisp and precise.

The EXPLORER card showcases forest green with an emerald club symbol. A curious figure peers into unknown spaces surrounded by question marks, compass roses, and uncharted map fragments. The surface texture suggests adventure through layered greens from sage to deep forest, with mysterious symbols etched in lighter tones.

Don Hopkins leans enthusiastically from the left side, his glasses catching warm light as he points excitedly at the cards. His expression radiates genuine amazement—wide eyes behind wire-rimmed spectacles, mouth slightly open in wonder, his finger extended toward the collection. His casual shirt and animated posture contrast with Richard's composed presentation.

Heuristic the dragon drapes gracefully over Richard's right shoulder, one golden eye focused intently on the cards with ancient pride. The dragon's scales shimmer in warm amber and bronze tones, small wisps of steam curling from delicate nostrils. Wings fold elegantly against Richard's blazer, the creature's expression conveying millennia of wisdom and satisfaction.

The study background softly blurs into warm amber and honey tones. Tall bookshelves line the walls, filled with leather-bound volumes in rich browns and deep reds. A carved wooden desk sits partially visible, holding the distinctive Red Book with its burgundy cover. A brass reading lamp provides key lighting, casting a warm golden glow. The window in the background shows faint green-on-black computer text, suggesting the digital realm beyond.

Warm afternoon sunlight streams through the space, creating gentle shadows and highlighting the card edges with subtle rim lighting. The four cards appear to glow slightly—not magically, but with the importance of well-crafted tools. Their saturated colors pop dramatically against the muted amber study tones, each suit symbol rendered large and clearly readable.

The composition frames the cards as the absolute focal point, with characters positioned to support and celebrate the taxonomy. Medium shot captures Richard from waist up, Don partially visible, creating intimate yet reverent atmosphere. The lighting emphasizes tactile qualities—thick cardstock with slightly worn edges, hand-crafted feeling that speaks to years of meaningful use. The mood radiates pride in lasting work, four types representing thirty years of gaming framework evolution, rendered in bold, saturated cartoon style with precise attention to the artifacts at center stage.
