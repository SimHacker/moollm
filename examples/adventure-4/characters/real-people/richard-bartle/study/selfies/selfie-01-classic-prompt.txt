A warm, whimsical cartoon illustration in a storybook style with Pixar-adjacent character design meets Oliver Jeffers hand-drawn warmth. Rich saturated colors with visible brushstrokes and pencil texture creating a cozy, lived-in atmosphere.

FOREGROUND: Don Hopkins, a friendly man in his late 50s, extends his arm toward the viewer holding a smartphone in classic selfie pose. His red-gray tousled hair catches the golden afternoon light, wire-rimmed glasses sitting slightly crooked on his nose. Huge genuine grin spreads across his face showing real joy, eyes crinkled at the corners with deep laugh lines. He wears a comfortable programmer t-shirt in warm gray with a subtle tech logo, fabric slightly wrinkled from daily wear. His extended arm creates dynamic leading lines, phone screen reflecting the warm study lighting.

MIDDLE GROUND: Richard Bartle, distinguished English academic in his 60s, sits at a large wooden desk worn smooth by decades of use. Silver-white hair swept back from a high intellectual forehead, blue-grey eyes holding that knowing academic look with a slight smile that says he's tolerating this selfie nonsense with amused affection. He wears a blue-striped collared shirt open at the neck beneath a navy blazer with worn leather elbow patches. His left hand rests protectively on a thick RED BOOK with "Designing Virtual Worlds" visible on the spine, the crimson cover providing a strong color accent. On the desk surface: four oversized tarot-style playing cards spread in an elegant fan - a spade symbol in deep purple-black, a heart in rose-gold, a diamond in blue-gold, and a club in forest green. Scattered academic papers, a ceramic coffee cup with cold coffee showing a slight film, fountain pens, and scholarly clutter complete the desktop tableau.

BACKGROUND: Heuristic the Dragon peers curiously from behind towering bookshelves, a serpentine bronze creature the size of a large dog. Scales shimmer with verdigris patina like ancient weathered brass, each scale individually detailed with green-blue oxidation patterns. Vestigial wings fold against his back showing delicate membrane details. His golden eyes are WIDE OPEN - unusual for this normally sleepy creature - reflecting genuine curiosity about this strange "selfie" concept. Ancient wisdom meets childlike wonder in his expression.

SETTING: A scholar's study with floor-to-ceiling bookshelves covering every wall, books organized by historical era. Visible shelf labels in neat academic handwriting: "Before MUD", "MUD Era", "1978-1985", and "Mistakes They Keep Making" - this last shelf notably overstuffed with books spilling over. The books themselves show years of love - yellowed pages, worn spines, some held together with tape. A large multi-paned window reveals something impossible: bright green text on black background showing a classic MUD room description floating in digital space. An old cast-iron radiator with detailed metalwork sits beneath the window. Warm afternoon light streams through amber-tinted glass, creating golden rectangles on the worn hardwood floor.

LIGHTING AND ATMOSPHERE: Late afternoon sunlight bathes everything in warm ambers, golds, and creams. A brass reading lamp with green glass shade adds pools of warm yellow light across the desk surface. Dust motes dance visibly in the sunbeams. Deep shadows between bookshelves create cozy nooks filled with academic treasures.

COMPOSITION: Wide-angle selfie perspective with slight upward angle and characteristic selfie distortion at frame edges. Don's extended arm and phone dominate the lower frame. All three characters remain sharp focus while background shelves soften slightly but remain legible. The Red Book and colorful taxonomy cards create strong focal points leading the eye through the composition.

ARTISTIC STYLE: Exaggerated cartoon expressions with big expressive eyes, slightly oversized heads, and warm color saturation. Characters have the appealing rounded features of quality animation with individual personality shining through every detail.
