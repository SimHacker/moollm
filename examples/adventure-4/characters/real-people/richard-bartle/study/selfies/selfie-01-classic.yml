  A warm, whimsical cartoon illustration in a storybook style. Pixar-adjacent
  character design meets Oliver Jeffers hand-drawn warmth. Rich saturated colors.
  
  THREE CHARACTERS taking a selfie in a cozy scholar's study:
  
  FOREGROUND (holding camera, arm extended):
  Don Hopkins — a friendly man in his late 50s with red-gray tousled hair and
  wire-rimmed glasses sitting slightly crooked on his nose. Huge genuine grin
  showing real joy, eyes crinkled at the corners. Wearing a comfortable
  programmer t-shirt (maybe with a subtle logo or joke). His arm extends
  toward the viewer holding a phone, classic selfie pose. Warm, enthusiastic,
  the kind of person who gets genuinely excited about ideas.
  
  MIDDLE GROUND (at desk, half-turned):
  Richard Bartle — distinguished English academic in his 60s. Silver-white
  hair swept back from a high forehead. Blue-grey eyes with that knowing
  look. Slight smile that says "I'm tolerating this selfie nonsense with
  amusement." Blue-striped collared shirt open at the neck, navy blazer
  with elbow patches. One hand rests on a worn RED BOOK (Designing Virtual
  Worlds). On the desk: four oversized tarot-style playing cards spread
  in a fan — ♠️ in purple/black, ♥️ in rose-gold, ♦️ in blue/gold, 
  ♣️ in forest green. Papers, cold coffee cup, academic clutter.
  
  BACKGROUND (peeking over bookshelf):
  Heuristic the Dragon — a serpentine bronze dragon the size of a large dog,
  scales showing verdigris patina like ancient brass. Golden eyes WIDE OPEN
  (unusual for this normally sleepy creature!) peering curiously into frame
  from behind a bookshelf labeled "1978-1985" in neat academic handwriting.
  Vestigial wings folded against its back. Expression: ancient wisdom meets
  genuine curiosity about this "selfie" concept.
  
  SETTING:
  A scholar's study FILLED with books on every wall — floor to ceiling
  shelves organized by era. Labels visible: "Before MUD", "MUD Era",
  "Mistakes They Keep Making" (this shelf notably overstuffed). Large
  wooden desk worn smooth by decades of use. A window showing something
  impossible — green text on black, a MUD room description. Old cast-iron
  radiator. Warm afternoon light streaming in, golden and amber. A reading
  lamp adds warm glow. The smell of old paper made visual through the
  yellowed edges of beloved books.
  
  MOOD:
  Pure joy. Three pioneers of virtual worlds — two humans and a concept
  made manifest — capturing a moment of genuine friendship. Forty years
  of shared history compressed into one warm instant. The study is
  knowledge made cozy. The dragon is wisdom made visible. The selfie is
  friendship made permanent.
  
  COLOR PALETTE:
  Warm ambers, golds, and creams dominate. The Red Book pops. The taxonomy
  cards provide accent colors. Heuristic's bronze-verdigris provides cool
  contrast. Everything bathed in late afternoon warmth.
  
  STYLE NOTES:
  NOT photorealistic. Exaggerated expressions. Visible brushstrokes or
  pencil texture. Characters have big expressive eyes. The dragon should
  look wise and ancient but also endearing. Books should feel lived-in,
  not decorative. This is a home, not a museum.
  
  CAMERA:
  Selfie angle — slightly from below, wide-angle distortion at edges,
  Don's hand and phone visible in lower frame. Depth of field keeps all
  three characters sharp, background slightly softened but legible.
