  A wide cartoon illustration of the full study, featuring a MAGICAL
  WINDOW that shows a MUD text adventure. Mixed media: warm cartoon
  illustration for the room, retro pixel/terminal aesthetic for the
  window content.
  
  THE WINDOW (key visual element):
  A large study window that doesn't show the outside — instead, it
  displays green phosphor text on a black background, like an old
  terminal. The text is READABLE:
  
  ```
  > You are in a cozy study.
  
  Books line every wall. A large wooden
  desk holds papers and strange cards.
  
  A DRAGON is here, watching.
  Two SCHOLARS are present.
  
  Obvious exits: KNOWLEDGE, HISTORY, FUTURE
  
  > _
  ```
  
  The window glows slightly with that CRT phosphor glow. It's both
  a window and a screen and a portal.
  
  THE THREE CHARACTERS:
  Grouped near the window, all looking at it and at the camera
  simultaneously (cartoon logic).
  
  Don Hopkins: Pointing at the window excitedly, his other hand
  holding up a phone for the selfie. "This is where it started!"
  
  Richard Bartle: Standing by the window, one hand touching the
  frame, expression nostalgic and proud. His reflection might be
  visible in the glass — younger, 1978.
  
  Heuristic: Curled on the windowsill, serpentine body framing the
  bottom of the window, golden eyes reflecting the green text.
  The dragon was there. The dragon remembers.
  
  THE ROOM:
  Full study visible — shelves of books organized by era, the desk
  with Red Book and taxonomy cards, the reading chair, the old
  radiator. Everything warm and amber except the cool green glow
  from the window.
  
  MIXED MEDIA STYLE:
  The ROOM is warm, painterly, cartoon — visible brushstrokes,
  soft edges, saturated colors.
  
  The WINDOW CONTENT is crisp, pixel-precise, retro-terminal —
  sharp edges, monospace font, scan lines suggested, green-on-black.
  
  This contrast is intentional: the cozy analog present contains
  a portal to the digital past.
  
  LIGHTING:
  Warm afternoon light fills the room. Cool green light spills from
  the window onto nearby surfaces — Richard's face half-lit amber,
  half-lit green. Heuristic's scales catch both colors.
  
  MOOD:
  "This is where virtual worlds were born." The window shows what
  Richard and Roy created in 1978. The room is what it became.
  The dragon connects them. The text adventure format IS the
  ancestor of everything — MMOs, social VR, MOOLLM itself.
  
  COMPOSITION:
  Wide shot showing the full room context. The window is the
  natural focal point — brightest, most contrasting. Characters
  arranged around it like a family portrait, but casual.
  
  TEXT DETAIL:
  The MUD text should be READABLE but not dominant. It's Easter
  egg level — you notice it, you can read it, it rewards attention.
  The "A DRAGON is here, watching" line should be visible.
