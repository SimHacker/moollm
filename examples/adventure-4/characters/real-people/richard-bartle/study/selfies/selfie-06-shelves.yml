  A wide cartoon illustration where the BOOKSHELVES are the main
  subject. The characters are present but smaller — this shot is
  about the accumulated knowledge.
  
  THE SHELVES (detailed, readable labels):
  Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves covering the entire back wall,
  organized with academic precision. Each section has a handwritten
  label in neat script:
  
  "Before MUD (1960-1977)" — Sparse, foundational texts
  "MUD Era (1978-1985)" — Well-worn, frequently referenced
  "The Spread (1985-1995)" — Expanding collection
  "MMO Era (1995-2010)" — Industry volumes, some pristine
  "Player Psychology" — Dog-eared, annotated
  "World Design" — Technical, detailed
  "MISTAKES THEY KEEP MAKING" — NOTABLY OVERSTUFFED, books jammed
    in sideways, papers sticking out, this shelf is FULL
  
  The "Mistakes" shelf should be visually emphasized — maybe
  sagging slightly under the weight, or with a small sign that
  says "Updated Annually."
  
  THE CHARACTERS (smaller in frame):
  Standing together in front of the shelves, dwarfed by the
  accumulated knowledge:
  
  Don Hopkins: Arms spread wide, encompassing gesture, expression
  of delighted awe. "Look at all of this!"
  
  Richard Bartle: Standing with quiet pride, maybe one hand resting
  on a shelf labeled with an era he lived through. Slight smile.
  
  Heuristic: Perched on the "1978-1985" shelf (favorite spot),
  curled around books, part of the collection, watching.
  
  THE BOOKS:
  Not generic spines — variety of sizes, colors, conditions. Some
  pristine academic volumes. Some worn paperbacks. Some binders of
  papers. Some with bookmarks sticking out. Some stacked horizontally
  because they don't fit. A few with visible titles that reward
  close looking:
  - "Designing Virtual Worlds" (red, prominent)
  - "MMOs from the Inside Out"
  - "Understanding Comics" (Easter egg)
  - Various academic journals
  
  COMPOSITION:
  Wide shot, almost architectural. The shelves form strong vertical
  lines. The characters break up the pattern but don't dominate.
  This is a portrait of a LIBRARY as much as its inhabitants.
  
  LIGHTING:
  Warm but even — showing shelf detail. Maybe a reading lamp
  creating a pool of warmer light where the characters stand.
  The window provides some backlighting.
  
  MOOD:
  Awe at accumulated knowledge. "This is what 40+ years of
  thinking about virtual worlds looks like." The slightly
  overstuffed "Mistakes" shelf is the punchline — we KNOW what
  goes wrong, but people keep doing it anyway.
  
  HUMOR:
  The "Mistakes They Keep Making" shelf being the fullest one.
  Maybe a small sticky note on it: "See Also: Every New MMO"
  
  STYLE NOTES:
  More detailed than other shots — the background IS the subject.
  Book spines should be varied and interesting. Labels should be
  readable (unlike most cartoon libraries where books are generic).
  This is a working library, not decoration.
