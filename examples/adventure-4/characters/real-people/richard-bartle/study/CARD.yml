  # OLFACTORY ENVIRONMENT  
  smell:
    primary:
      books: |
        Old paper, leather bindings, the vanilla-almond scent of 
        lignin slowly releasing from aging pages. Different eras 
        of books have different smells — the 1970s paperbacks 
        sharper, the leather-bounds more complex.
        
      tea: |
        Earl Grey predominantly. Sometimes builder's tea (strong, 
        milk, no nonsense). The ghost of tea past lingers even 
        when no cup is present.
        
      wood: |
        Mahogany bookshelves, oak desk, polished by decades of use.
        Wood oil applied annually, absorbed into grain.
        
    secondary:
      radiator_warmth: "The smell of heated metal and old paint"
      dust: "Not unpleasant — the dust of knowledge"
      dragon: "Faint bronze and ozone when Heuristic stirs"
      ink: "From the fountain pen, blue-black and permanent"
      
    seasonal:
      winter: "Stronger tea, radiator at full, wool blankets"
      summer: "Window open, cut grass from outside, lighter tea"
      autumn: "Damp leaves, stronger book smell, melancholy comfort"
      spring: "Fresh air competing with must, energizing"
      
    memory_triggers:
      "Old photocopies": "Recalls the 1980s, toner smell"
      "Specific leather binding": "Each book has its own memory"
      "Fresh tea": "Every good conversation started here"

  # TACTILE ENVIRONMENT
  tactile:
    chair: "Leather worn smooth, conforms to you"
    books: "Some rough, some smooth, all weighted with meaning"
    desk: "Cool polish, warm where sun hits"
    papers: "Various textures — old thick stock, modern printer paper"
    tea_cup: "Warm ceramic, familiar in the hand"
    radiator: "Hot metal, Heuristic's scales unexpectedly warm"
