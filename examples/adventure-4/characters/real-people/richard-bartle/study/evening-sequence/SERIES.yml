# 🌙 Evening Sequence — Iterative Narrative Series
#
# PRINCIPLE: Each image sees the full context of all previous images.
# Like telephone, but with memory. Like conversation, but visual.
#
# METHOD:
#   1. Write YAML skeleton (narrative intent)
#   2. Synthesize environmental context into rich prompt
#   3. Generate image
#   4. Mine image with MULTIPLE LENSES (colored fordite layers)
#   5. Let emergence inform next image
#   6. Repeat — each image richer than the last
#
# STYLE: Abstract Pixar-adjacent CGI, warm evening light, scholarly atmosphere
# CHARACTERS: Richard, Don, Heuristic, Non Sequitur (appears when he wants)
# LOCATION: Richard's study, evening descending into night
# THEME: "An evening of old friends, dragons, and unexpected rabbits"

series:
  name: "Evening Sequence"
  subtitle: "What Happens When Don Visits the Study"
  
  date: "2026-01-22"

    VISUAL LANGUAGE:
    - Abstract CGI rendering, Pixar-adjacent but more painterly
    - Warm incandescent lighting, deepening as series progresses
    - Rich textures: aged leather, bronze scales, glowing screens
    - Cartoony proportions allowed (especially for Non Sequitur)
    - The room is a character — shelves should feel alive with history
    
    CONTINUITY ELEMENTS:
    - Window view changes with each frame (showing what Richard thinks about)
    - Tea cups accumulate (narrative time marker)
    - Heuristic's position shifts slightly — always watching
    - Books migrate from shelves to piles as discussion deepens
    
    COLOR PALETTE:
    - Warm amber and gold (incandescent bulbs)
    - Bronze and verdigris (Heuristic's scales)
    - Deep burgundy and forest green (old books)
    - Cream and pink (Non Sequitur's chaos injection)
    
  narrative_arc:
    frame_01: "Arrival — Don enters the study at golden hour"
    frame_02: "The Question — Don asks about something he's been thinking about"
    frame_03: "The Cards — Richard deals out the Bartle taxonomy"
    frame_04: "Heuristic Speaks — The dragon decides to contribute"
    frame_05: "The Uninvited Guest — Non Sequitur appears (because of course)"
    frame_06: "The Tangent — Conversation goes somewhere unexpected"
    frame_07: "The Insight — Something clicks. Eyes widen."
    frame_08: "Night Falls — The study in blue darkness, still talking"

  accumulated_context: []  # This grows with each frame
  
  fordite_lenses:
    - historical     # Art history, visual references
    - emotional      # Mood, feeling, atmosphere
    - narrative      # Story implications, before/after
    - symbolic       # Hidden meanings, metaphors
    - relational     # Character dynamics, power, attention
    
  protocol: |
    FOR EACH FRAME:
    
    1. SKELETON — Write frame-NN.yml with narrative intent
    2. CONTEXT SYNTHESIS — Read all previous frames, mines, room, characters
    3. PROMPT CRYSTALLIZATION — Write frame-NN-prompt.txt (rich, specific, ~400 tokens)
    4. IMAGE GENERATION — Run visualizer with --raw-prompt
    5. MINING LAYERS — Apply 2-3 lenses from fordite_lenses
    6. EMERGENCE CAPTURE — Note what appeared that wasn't asked for
    7. CONTEXT UPDATE — Add this frame's data to accumulated_context
    8. PROCEED — Next frame sees everything
