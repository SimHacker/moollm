  narrative_beat: |
    Don Hopkins pushes open the door that wasn't there a moment ago.
    The study opens before him — books, golden light, the smell of
    old paper and cold tea. Richard looks up from his desk.
    
    From the radiator, Heuristic opens one eye.
    "Ah. The other one."
    
    This is the moment before the conversation. Everything is possible.
    
  scene_description: |
    CAMERA: Just inside the doorway, looking into the study
    TIME: Golden hour — late afternoon sun streaming through the window
    
    THE DOOR: Behind us (implied), just opened
    THE STUDY: Fully visible — shelves, desk, radiator, reading chair
    THE LIGHT: Warm amber, sun angling through window, dust motes visible
    
    RICHARD: At his desk, turning in chair, expression welcoming but curious
            "Looking for something specific, or just exploring?"
    
    DON: Just entering frame (from our POV), silhouette catching doorway light
         One hand possibly still on the door
         Posture of someone arriving, not yet settled
    
    HEURISTIC: Draped along radiator, bronze scales catching warm light
               One eye open, watching. Evaluating.
               Not hostile. Just... observing.
    
    THE WINDOW: Shows Essex campus in soft focus — a real place this time
                Richard's mind is grounded in welcome, not wandering
    
    DETAILS TO INCLUDE:
    - Tea cup on desk (full, still steaming — freshly made)
    - "Designing Virtual Worlds" visible on desk
    - Taxonomy cards face-down in a neat stack
    - Reading lamp OFF (natural light is enough)
    - Empty reading chair (inviting occupation)
    
    DETAILS TO EXCLUDE:
    - Non Sequitur (he hasn't appeared yet — that comes later)
    - Any chaos or disorder (this is BEFORE the conversation)
    - Night elements (it's golden hour, not evening yet)
    
  characters_present:
    - richard-bartle: "At desk, welcoming, curious"
    - don-hopkins: "Just arrived, silhouette in doorway"
    - heuristic: "On radiator, watching, one eye open"
    
  environment_cues:
    light_quality: "Golden hour amber, warm and welcoming"
    atmosphere: "Anticipation, possibility, the moment before"
    sound: "Door closing, chair turning, dragon rumble"
    smell: "Paper, tea, old books, radiator warmth"
    
  visual_style: |
    Abstract Pixar-adjacent CGI rendering.
    
    Warm color palette — amber, gold, bronze, burgundy.
    Soft volumetric light from window (god rays through dust).
    Rich textures on everything (leather, wood, scales, paper).
    
    NOT photorealistic — stylized and warm.
    Characters should feel like beloved animation, not uncanny valley.
    
    Composition: Rule of thirds. Don at left entering, Richard center-right,
    Heuristic lower right as anchor. Window as light source upper right.
    
  narrative_moment:
    just_before: "Don stood in the hallway. The door appeared."
    right_now: "Threshold crossing. The study opens like a book."
    just_after: "Richard will gesture to the reading chair. Tea will be offered."
    always: "Old friends meeting in the space where ideas live."
