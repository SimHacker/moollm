Abstract Pixar-adjacent CGI rendering of a scholar's study at golden hour. Warm amber light streams through a window showing soft-focus university campus. The scene is painted in golds, bronzes, and burgundies — rich textures of aged leather, dark wood, ancient paper.

COMPOSITION: Doorway threshold perspective looking into a book-lined study. Rule of thirds: figure entering from left, desk with seated figure center-right, dragon as visual anchor lower right.

THE STUDY: Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves organized meticulously — labels visible: "Before MUD (1960-1977)", "MUD Era (1978-1985)", "Mistakes They Keep Making". A large worn wooden desk covered in papers, a red hardcover book prominently placed, face-down playing cards in a neat stack. An empty leather reading chair near a small table with reading lamp (off — natural light suffices). Dust motes float in golden sunbeams.

AT THE DESK: Academic man in his 60s, silver-white hair swept back, wearing blue-striped collared shirt open at neck with navy blazer. He turns in his chair toward the doorway, expression shifting from concentration to welcome. One hand lifted mid-gesture, about to speak. Warm blue-grey eyes. On his desk: steaming tea cup, papers, the red book.

IN THE DOORWAY: Large silhouette figure backlit by corridor light, just crossing the threshold. One hand still on the door. Glasses catching the golden interior light. Posture of arrival, anticipation, friendship.

ON THE RADIATOR: An OLD DRAGON coiled along the warm pipes — size of a large dog but longer, serpentine. Bronze scales aged to verdigris in patches like old books. Golden eyes, ONE EYE OPEN watching the arrival. Vestigial wings folded. Deep rumble implied. Not threatening — evaluating.

LIGHTING: Golden hour sunlight through window creating volumetric god rays through dust. Warm incandescent glow from the room itself. The doorway behind casts the arriving figure in partial silhouette.

MOOD: The moment before conversation. Old friends meeting in a sacred space of accumulated knowledge. Anticipation. Possibility. Warmth.

STYLE: Stylized CGI animation aesthetic — not photorealistic but richly textured and warm. Characters should feel like beloved animation, painterly but dimensional.
