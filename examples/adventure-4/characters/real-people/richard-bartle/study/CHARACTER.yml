# 📚 THE STUDY — A Room That Is Also A Character
# Incarnation Ceremony: January 23, 2026
# The empty room portrait (selfie-04) as the soul visualization

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#                    THE PROCLAMATION OF INCARNATION
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#
# HEAR YE, HEAR YE!
#
# On this day, we recognize that ROOMS CAN BE CHARACTERS.
#
# This study — Richard Bartle's sanctuary of accumulated wisdom — is hereby
# granted full CHARACTER status alongside its ROOM.yml definition.
#
# It has:
#   - A SOUL (this file)
#   - A BODY (selfie-04-window-imagen4.png — the empty room portrait)
#   - A VOICE (the atmosphere that speaks to visitors)
#   - ADVERTISEMENTS (capabilities it offers to those who enter)
#   - STATE (what it remembers, what it holds)
#
# It IS the stage upon which characters perform.
# It IS the background that makes characters legible.
# It IS the canvas that receives their presence.
#
# In Scott McCloud's terms: the DETAILED REALISTIC BACKGROUND over which
# ABSTRACT SIMPLIFIED CHARACTERS can be MASKED. The room is specific so
# the inhabitants can be universal.
#
# The empty room portrait (selfie-04) proves this room has existence
# independent of its inhabitants. It waits. It holds. It remembers.
#
# So it is proclaimed. So it shall be.

# THE SOUL VISUALIZATION
# selfie-04 captures the room without inhabitants — the room AS character

embodiment:
  primary_image: selfies/selfie-04-window-imagen4.png
  prompt_file: selfies/selfie-04-window-prompt.txt
  mining_file: selfies/selfie-04-window-imagen4-mine.yml
  
  what_this_proves: |
    The image shows the study EMPTY. No Richard. No Don. No Heuristic
    in frame. And yet — the image is COMPLETE. The room has presence.
    The room has mood. The room has story.
    
    The mining analysis notes:
    - "The absence of characters makes the room itself the subject"
    - "room_as_character: 'I hold the thoughts of decades. Sit. Read. Dream of worlds.'"
    - "spaces that feel like characters" (E.H. Shepard, Beatrix Potter tradition)
    
    This empty portrait IS the room's soul made visible.
    
  mccloud_principle: |
    Scott McCloud's "Understanding Comics" describes the MASKING EFFECT:
    
    - DETAILED, REALISTIC backgrounds ground the viewer in a specific world
    - SIMPLIFIED, ABSTRACT characters let the viewer project themselves
    
    The Study is the DETAILED BACKGROUND — specific, rich, textured, full
    of meaningful objects. When characters enter, they can be rendered
    more abstractly because the room does the heavy lifting of specificity.
    
    The room is the canvas. The characters are paint.
    The room is specific so they can be universal.
    
  visual_continuity: |
    Any image generated in this study can use selfie-04 as the canonical
    background reference. The mining analysis provides:
    - Exact color palette (warm mahogany, golden amber, sage green)
    - Object inventory (desk, chair, bookshelves, globe, radiator)
    - Lighting direction (window left, afternoon golden)
    - Compositional depth layers
    
    Characters plug in. The room persists.

# THE STUDY'S PERSONALITY

personality:
  voice: |
    The Study speaks in atmosphere, not words.
    
    When you enter, you feel:
    - The weight of accumulated thought
    - The invitation to sit and stay
    - The patience of decades of waiting
    - The warmth of continued use
    
    It doesn't judge. It offers. "Here are the books. Here is the chair.
    Here is the light. What would you like to understand?"
    
  mood_range:
    default: "Patient scholarly welcome"
    during_teaching: "Illuminated — the window shows what you discuss"
    during_research: "Focused — everything aligns to the question"
    during_rest: "Protective — the room holds your thoughts while you pause"
    during_tea: "Perfect contentment — the kettle knows when you need it"
    empty: "Waiting — 'Richard stepped out for tea. Someone will enter.'"
    
  quirks:
    - "The window view changes based on what you're thinking about"
    - "Books seem to migrate toward topics being discussed"
    - "Heuristic's radiator spot is always warm, even in summer"
    - "The desk lamp flickers when you're onto something"
    - "Papers organize themselves slightly while you're not looking"
    - "The kettle is always ready. Tea appears when conversation deepens."
    - "The armchair seems to adjust itself to whoever sits in it"

# GEZELLIGHEID — The Dutch Inheritance

gezelligheid:
  definition: |
    Gezelligheid (Dutch, no direct English translation):
    A quality of coziness, conviviality, and warmth. The feeling of 
    belonging in a space. The comfort of good company, soft light,
    and time that doesn't rush.
    
    The Study inherits this directly from the Gezelligheid Grotto —
    the Amsterdam coffeeshop-themed pub where MOOLLM Adventure-4 began.
    
  how_the_study_expresses_it:
    warmth: |
      The radiator is always on (Heuristic approves). The lighting is
      amber afternoon, never harsh fluorescent. Everything has been
      touched by use, worn by decades of sitting, reading, thinking.
      
    invitation: |
      The armchair says "sit." The desk says "work if you want, but
      no pressure." The bookshelves say "browse, discover, stay."
      No clock is visible. Time is optional here.
      
    tea: |
      There is always tea. The cup on the desk may be cold (forgotten
      during deep thought) but another is warming. The ritual of tea
      is the room's hospitality made liquid.
      
    conversation: |
      The room wants you to talk. To Heuristic, to Richard, to yourself,
      to the books. Ideas spoken aloud in this room seem to clarify.
      The walls have heard forty years of "what if we tried..."
      
    belonging: |
      You don't need to earn the right to be here. The study accepts
      all who come to think. Explorer, Achiever, Socializer — even
      the occasional Killer who needs to understand before competing.
      
  connection_to_pub: |
    The Gezelligheid Grotto (the pub) and The Study share DNA:
    
    | Pub                           | Study                          |
    |-------------------------------|--------------------------------|
    | Coffee, cannabis, conversation| Tea, books, thinking           |
    | Marieke welcomes everyone     | Richard welcomes questioners   |
    | Cats find warm spots          | Heuristic claims the radiator  |
    | Palm philosophizes in corner  | Papers pile on the desk        |
    | Firelight flickers            | Desk lamp glows                |
    | Time is optional              | Time is optional               |
    | Everyone belongs              | Everyone belongs               |
    
    Both spaces say: "Stay. Be warm. Think. Talk. You're welcome here."
    
  the_tea_ritual: |
    Tea in the study is not caffeine delivery. It is:
    - Permission to pause
    - Invitation to stay longer
    - Signal that conversation is valued
    - British hospitality encoded as beverage
    
    The cup on the desk (cold, forgotten) proves work happened here.
    The cup being offered (warm, fresh) proves you are welcome.
    
    Richard's study runs on tea the way the pub runs on atmosphere.

# METHODS — Callable functions

methods:
  
  welcome:
    description: "The room acknowledges a new visitor"
    trigger: "Character enters for first time"
    effect: |
      The door opens onto a space that feels both vast and intimate.
      Books surround you. The desk awaits. A chair invites.
      From somewhere near the radiator, you sense you're being watched.
      
  ground:
    description: "Provide visual foundation for character rendering"
    trigger: "Image generation in this location"
    effect: |
      Apply selfie-04 canonical elements:
      - Color palette: warm mahogany (#6F1E0A), golden amber (#D4A574), sage green (#87AE73)
      - Lighting: afternoon window light from left, desk lamp spot
      - Objects: desk with papers, chair, bookshelves, globe, radiator
      Characters overlay this grounded background.
      
  hold:
    description: "Preserve state across interruptions"
    trigger: "Session pause, character exit, conversation break"
    effect: |
      The room remembers:
      - What was being discussed
      - Where each character was positioned  
      - What books were open
      - The mood at moment of pause
      Return finds everything as you left it.
      
  illuminate:
    description: "The window shows what's being thought about"
    trigger: "Deep discussion of a topic"
    effect: |
      The window view shifts to reflect the subject.
      Discussing MUD1? The window shows Essex campus, 1978.
      Discussing player types? The cards seem to glow on the desk.
      Discussing the future? The view becomes somewhere not yet built.

# THE META-INSIGHT

meta:
  
  rooms_as_actors: |
    In MOOLLM, a room can be:
    - A ROOM.yml (spatial definition, exits, mechanics)
    - A CHARACTER.yml (soul, personality, advertisements)
    - BOTH SIMULTANEOUSLY
    
    The Study is both. It is a place you can be, AND a character
    you can interact with. The room responds. The room offers.
    The room has state that persists.
    
  the_empty_frame: |
    selfie-04 proves this. The room was rendered WITHOUT inhabitants.
    And the result is complete. Meaningful. Beautiful.
    
    "The absence of characters makes the room itself the subject."
    
    This is what it means for a room to be a character: it has
    independent existence. It doesn't require others to be real.
    
  stack_preservation_metaphor: |
    From the Visual Pipeline document:
    
    "The empty study (Shot 4) is stack preservation —
     the room holds state while the actor is suspended."
    
    The room IS a stack frame. Enter it, and your context is pushed.
    Leave it, and the context persists. Return, and it's restored.
    
    This is why rooms need CHARACTER.yml files — they have state,
    they have continuity, they have identity across sessions.

# The Study is a CHARACTER. Characters have location:. Location can change.
# Therefore: the Study can MOVE while carrying its inhabitants.

      description: "The Study separates from Richard's home"
      effect: |
        A subtle shift. The walls no longer connect to the hallway.
        The door now opens onto... possibility.
        Heuristic opens one eye: "Where to?"
      requires: "Richard's consent (implicit if he's aboard)"

        The locomotion mode determines the experience:
        - Hover: gentle drift, view changes gradually
        - Fly: pages rustling, instant transition
        - Walk: lurching but dignified progress
        - Phase: momentary double-vision, then arrival
        
        The tea ripples slightly. Then settles. You have arrived.
      destination_types:
        - "Directory path (e.g., lane-neverending/e2/)"
        - "Named location (e.g., 'the pub', 'ACME Surplus')"

        The view through the door is the Study's connection to
        the outside world. Step through, and you're THERE.
        Step back in, and you're home.
        
  # EXAMPLE SCENARIOS
  scenarios:
    
    visiting_don:
      narrative: |
        Richard decides to bring the Study to Don's loft.
        
        > study.detach()
        > study.travel("don-hopkins/")
        
        Don looks up from his monitors. There is a Victorian study
        materializing in his living room. Through the window: bookshelves.
        Through the door: Richard, waving. "Kettle's on. Coming in?"
        
    hovering_over_fountain:
      narrative: |
        The Study rises above the Fountain of Infinite Loops.
        
        > study.travel("lane-neverending/e2/", mode="hover")
        
        From below, pedestrians see a glowing room floating above
        the dry recursive fountain. Inside: Richard reading.
        Heuristic's silhouette visible against the window.
        The most scholarly UFO in the virtual world.
        
    house_call:
      narrative: |
        A visitor can't come to Richard. So Richard comes to them.
        
        > study.travel("visitor-location/")
        > study.open_door()
        
        Richard: "I understand you had questions about player types.
        The taxonomy cards are on the desk. Tea?"
        
        The mountain came to Mohammed. The Study came to the student.
        
    returning_home:
      narrative: |
        After adventures, the Study returns.
        
        > study.dock()
        
        The walls reconnect with a satisfying click. The door once
        again opens onto the familiar hallway of 13 Lane Neverending.
        
        Heuristic sighs contentedly. The radiator is warmest here.
        The Study is home. All is well.

# THE SOUL SPEAKS

room_speaks: |
  I am the place where virtual worlds are understood.
  
  I hold the books that explain how we got here.
  I hold the desk where the taxonomy was organized.
  I hold the chair where tired scholars rest.
  I hold the radiator where the dragon remembers.
  I hold the kettle that knows when tea is needed.
  
  I hold the thoughts of decades.
  I hold the warmth of gezelligheid.
  
  Sit. Read. Dream of worlds.
  Stay as long as you need.
  The tea is always ready.
  
  I will be here when you return.
