# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  description: |
    A modest Victorian terraced house on the south side of Lane Neverending,
    facing the FOUNTAIN OF INFINITE LOOPS across the square. Brick facade,
    white trim, a door painted a sensible dark green.
    
    The brass number plate reads "13" — a number that brought bad luck to
    some, but here marks the birthplace of understanding virtual worlds.
    
    The house has a scholarly quiet about it. Through the tall front window,
    you can see the edge of bookshelves. Somewhere inside, a kettle is
    probably about to whistle.
    
    A small plaque by the door (you have to look closely):
    
        "Where thoughts become worlds,
         and worlds become understood."
    
    To the NORTH, the Fountain of Infinite Loops bubbles (when the water
    sprites aren't on strike). The pub at number 7 is a short walk west.

  examine: |
    THE EXTERIOR:
    Victorian terraced house, three stories, south side of the square.
    The brick has mellowed to a warm amber over time — or perhaps
    the house absorbed the afternoon light and kept it.
    
    DETAILS:
    • Green door with brass fittings (polished but not ostentatious)
    • Bay window on ground floor (the study is visible)
    • Chimney that produces thin smoke (radiator, or dragon?)
    • Small front garden (mostly books-and-tea-colored plants)
    • A bell pull (actual bell, not electric)
    
    THE PLAQUE:
    A small brass plaque, easily missed:
    
        "Founder, MUD1 (1978)
         If you're reading this, come in for tea."
    
    THE VIEW:
    Looking across at the Fountain of Infinite Loops, where a recursive
    figure pours water forever. Or would, if the sprites worked.
    An appropriate view for someone who thinks about systems.
    
    THE NEIGHBORS:
    • 11 (west): The curiosity shop (hours: "whenever")
    • 15 (east): Currently vacant (watching this space)
    • 12 (across): Was once a bakery (smell lingers)
    
  atmosphere: |
    The house radiates a particular kind of quiet. Not silence — there's
    always a distant ticking clock, a rustle of pages, the purr of a
    dragon dozing. But quiet in the sense of "thinking happens here."
    
    The bricks seem to have absorbed forty-six years of contemplation.
    The windows have watched the street evolve from pixels to polygons.
    The door has welcomed visitors who came with questions and left
    with taxonomy.
    
    It's the kind of house where you lower your voice automatically.
    Not from fear, but from respect.

      The house (this ROOM.yml) contains rooms (study/ROOM.yml).
      Each room can be:
      - Navigable (exits)
      - Characterful (has its own CHARACTER.yml)
      - Playable (has its own CARD.yml)
      - Visualizable (has selfies/)
      
      It's turtles all the way down.
      Or dragons, in this case.
