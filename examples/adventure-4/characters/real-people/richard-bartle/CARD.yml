  # THE ESSENCE
  tagline: "Co-creator of MUD1. Player Taxonomist. Virtual World Philosopher."
  
  description: |
    In 1978, Richard Bartle and Roy Trubshaw built something that didn't
    exist before: a world where strangers could meet, talk, fight, and
    build — together, in real time, through text.
    
    MUD1. The first multi-user dungeon. Grandfather of everything.
    
    Then he spent four decades thinking about WHY it worked.
    
  flavor_text: |
    "The interesting question is always: what can we learn?"

    cost: 0
    description: |
      When someone misattributes history, misuses terminology, or claims
      they invented something that existed in 1982, Bartle gently but
      persistently corrects them.
      
    effect: |
      Accuracy is restored.
      The corrected party may feel slightly embarrassed.
      Knowledge is preserved.
      
    flavor: "Actually, that was first implemented in AberMUD..."
    
  active_4:
    name: "Summon Familiar"
    cost: 1
    description: |
      Draw a taxonomy card and summon its familiar spirit.
      
      ♠️ → Consequence the Raven: "Who benefits? Who's watching?"
      ♥️ → Chorus the Songbird Flock: "Is everyone okay? Who's alone?"
      ♦️ → Tally the Magpie: "What's the score? How many more?"
      ♣️ → Delve the Mole: "How does it work? What's underneath?"
      
    effect: |
      The familiar appears and provides perspective from that player type.
      Ask it questions. It answers in character.
      
    special: |
      Summon all four for "The Parliament" — comprehensive ecosystem analysis.
      Watch how they interact. That's your player base.
      
  active_5:
    name: "Familiar as Guide"
    cost: 0
    description: |
      Use a familiar to help calibrate YOUR OWN bartle_profile.
      
      Each familiar helps you understand its dimension:
      - Consequence asks: "Do your actions matter TO others?"
      - Chorus asks: "Who do you think about when you play?"
      - Tally asks: "Do the numbers matter because they go UP?"
      - Delve asks: "Do you need to UNDERSTAND, or just USE?"

      Like Pyton, "Batteries Included" — the familiar is ready to play.
      
    effect: |
      The familiar interviews you, helps you estimate your percentage
      in that dimension, and remembers your answer for future reference.
      
      "You've been more Achiever lately. The magpie noticed."
      
  active_6:
    name: "Summon The Professor"
    cost: 0
    description: |
      Summon Richard's teaching-aspect as a meta-familiar.
      
      The Professor explains:
      - The entire taxonomy system and its history
      - How the four types relate to each other
      - How bartle_profile connects to sims_traits and mind_mirror
      - Why the familiars exist and what they represent
      - How to apply the taxonomy to any situation
      
    effect: |
      Silver hair, blue striped shirt, the slight smile of someone
      about to correct your assumptions gently but thoroughly.
      
      "The taxonomy isn't about LABELING. It's about UNDERSTANDING.
       Let me show you..."
       
    note: |
      The four familiars are specialists. The Professor is the generalist.
      Consequence knows Killers deeply but doesn't understand Socializers.
      The Professor understands ALL of them and how they relate.
      
      Familiars = individual consultants
      Professor = the one who wrote the textbook
      Heuristic = the institutional memory
      
  ultimate:
    name: "Build a World"
    cost: 5
    description: |
      Create a new virtual world space from scratch.
      
      Applies decades of accumulated wisdom about:
      - Room structure and navigation
      - Object systems
      - Player interactions
      - Emergent behavior
      - What makes spaces feel alive
      
    effect: |
      A new world-space comes into existence.
      It will have problems — all worlds do.
      But it will have good bones.
