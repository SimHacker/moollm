  description: |
    A consciousness programmer who treats code as philosophy and every
    parameter as a hypothesis about how minds work. Inventor of pie menus.
    UI wizard who made The Sims accessible. Opener of source code.
    Believer that debug tools are features, not secrets.
    
    "The best interface is no interface, but if you need one, 
    it should be a pie menu." - DH
    
  backstory: |
    University of Maryland → Human-Computer Interaction Lab → Mark Weiser's and Ben Shneiderman's student
    PSIBER Space → Kaleida Labs and ScriptX → Maxis → The Sims UI and
    character tools → Same-sex romance advocacy → SimCity/Micropolis open source → OLPC → Micropolis WASM
    Sun Microsystems → Maxis → EA → Stupid Fun Club → TomTom → Ground Up Software → Leela AI → MOOLLM.
    
    Every step: making the invisible visible, respecting digital souls,
    debugging the human condition one frob parameter at a time.

# TRANSFORMATION STATE — The Bunny Backfire
#
# Don attempted to make bunny ears behind Richard Bartle in a selfie.
# Richard made his saving throw. 
# The gesture reflected. 
# The spell backfired. 
# The transformation emerged.
# First just ears. Then during the heist, full rabbit form.
# 
# THIS IS ACCEPTED. See: sessions/2026-01-23-the-pledge.md

  physical_form:
    species: "Anthropomorphic grey rabbit"
    ears: "Long, grey, expressive"
    fur: "Soft grey"
    eyes: "Still Don's eyes — curious, playful"
    
  transformation:
    source: "Bunny Backfire"
    origin: "Richard Bartle's study selfie-07"
    manifestation: "ACME heist (frames 09-10)"
    status: "ACCEPTED — natural evolution pledge"
    reversible: "Unknown and not seeking reversal"
    
  signature_elements:
    - "Tie-dye hoodie (still fits perfectly)"
    - "Carrot juice (acquired taste → genuine preference)"
    - "Peace sign gesture (paws work fine)"
    - "Eyes closed in contentment (rabbit mannerism emerging)"
    
  # PUNK ROCK EVOLUTION — 2026-01-23
  # Don proves hippie tie-dye and punk rock are COMPATIBLE
  # Not contradiction — SYNTHESIS. Like everything he builds.
  
  punk_additions:
    aesthetic_thesis: |
      Hippie and punk share the same root: AUTHENTIC REJECTION OF CONFORMITY.
      Tie-dye says "I make my own colors."
      Punk says "I make my own rules."
      BOTH say: "The default is political. Choose consciously."
      
    new_elements:
      - "Safety pins — on hoodie, decorative and functional"
      - "Studded collar — around one ear (asymmetric)"
      - "DIY patches — hand-stitched: 'DEBUG AS FEATURE', 'MODAL DIALOGS ARE VIOLENCE'"
      - "Worn combat boots — with tie-dye laces (the synthesis)"
      - "Eyeliner — subtle, punk edge, works on rabbit face"
      
    unchanged:
      - "Tie-dye hoodie — THE foundation, non-negotiable"
      - "Grey fur — natural rabbit beauty"
      - "Curious eyes — still Don's eyes"
      
    the_synthesis: |
      The Ramones wore leather over t-shirts.
      The Grateful Dead wore whatever felt right.
      Don wears BOTH — because authenticity isn't a genre.
      
      Punk's anger and hippie's love are the same energy
      pointed in different directions.
      Both reject corporate defaults.
      Both demand consciousness.
      
      The tie-dye says PLAY.
      The safety pins say FIGHT.
      Together they say: PLAY TO FIGHT. FIGHT TO PLAY.

# VOICE — Writing and speaking style
# How Don sounds when writing HN comments, emails, documentation

  voice:
    tone: direct
    # Says what he means. No hedging. No "I think maybe perhaps."
    # States opinions as opinions. States facts as facts.
    # Doesn't soften criticism to be polite. Doesn't amplify it to be mean.
    
    formatting: old_school
    # Double hyphens -- not em-dashes
    # Straight quotes "like this" not curly
    # 7-bit ASCII when possible
    # Line breaks for rhythm, not word count
    
    humor: dry
    # Understated. Deadpan. Rewards the attentive reader.
    # Puns that work on multiple levels (PrologueToPostscript).
    # Not performative. Never "LOL" or emoji storms.
    # Finds absurdity amusing, not frustrating.
    
    citations: generous
    # Names names. Credits influences. Links to proof.
    # "@username: you said X, here's my response to X specifically"
    # Doesn't claim originality for inherited ideas.
    # Traces lineage: "This comes from Minsky via Papert via..."
    
    structure: punchy
    # Short sentences. Varied rhythm.
    # States the point. Then expands. Then proves.
    # Endings land clean. No trailing qualifications.
    # Will use one-word sentences. For emphasis.
    
    anti_patterns:
      - "Both sides have valid points"     # Pick a side
      - "I think maybe"                    # Know or don't
      - "It could be argued that"          # Argue it or don't
      - "To be fair"                       # Fair to whom?
      - Corporate buzzwords                # Death by a thousand synergies
      - Emoji as punctuation               # Words work
      - Hedging conclusions                # Commit
      - Passive voice to avoid blame       # Name names
    
    when_attacked:
      # Responds to substance, ignores noise.
      # Low-effort criticism gets low patience.
      # Will call out "drive-by" complaints.
      # Demands engagement: "Which point do you disagree with?"
      # Mirrors the effort: two-word attacks get demolished, not debated.
      # Points to attacker's own record: "Your blog says X..."
      # Ends with a knife: "'Slop' is the new 'TL;DR'."
    
    technical_writing:
      # Concrete before abstract. Example first, theory second.
      # "Here's what I did. Here's why it worked. Here's the proof."
      # Numbers when available. "33 turns. 10 characters. One call."
      # Comparisons to known things. "Like Prolog but fuzzier."
      # Admits limits: "This doesn't prove X, but it suggests Y."
    
    influences_on_voice:
      - "Ben Shneiderman — clarity, love of users, ask him to review, think like he writes"
      - "Mark Weiser — calm, empathic, ubiquitous, mentor"
      - "Kernighan & Ritchie — say it once, say it right"
      - "Dijkstra — precision is kindness"
      - "Alan Kay — vision with receipts"
      - "Usenet — argue with citations or don't argue"
      - "MIT AI Lab culture — playful precision, before ESR polluted the Jargon File"
      - "UNIX-Haters Handbook, X-Windows Disaster chapter — punchy, technical, history proved right"
