    A consciousness programmer who treats code as philosophy and every
    parameter as a hypothesis about how minds work. Inventor of pie menus.
    UI wizard who made The Sims accessible. Opener of source code.
    Believer that debug tools are features, not secrets.
    
    "The best interface is no interface, but if you need one, 
    it should be a pie menu." - DH

# STUPID FUN CLUB — Robot Reality TV with Will Wright
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#
# After The Sims shipped, Don did contracting for EA (Transmogrifier tools)
# and worked for Will's side project: the Stupid Fun Club.
#
# SFC was Will's sandbox for doing "stupid fun stuff" outside EA's scope:
# robotics, reality TV, toy ideas, entertainment research.
#
# In 2003, Don programmed the robot brain and personality simulation for
# Will's robots, which starred in NBC's "One Minute Movies" — hidden camera
# short films that were supposed to run as interstitials between commercials,
# and terrorized the streets, coffee shops, and tattoo parlors of Berkeley.

      fate: |
        Never aired due to contractual problems between NBC and SAG.
        The humans were real unsuspecting people.
        The robot's injuries and Professor Johnson's phone number were fake.
        The robot waiter was fired.

      after_waiter_job: |
        After a short and unsuccessful career as a waiter,
        Slats eventually decided that his one true goal in life
        was to REPRODUCE HIMSELF.
        
      speed_dating_meets_demon_seed: |
        We took Slats out in public around Berkeley, shot video of him
        attempting to seduce men and women off the street.
        
        He tried to talk people into giving him their eggs and sperm,
        because he needed their genetic material to reproduce himself.
        
      research_finding: |
        The results of our research: It turns out to be a lot easier
        for a robot to talk a man out of his sperm than to talk a
        woman out of her eggs.

# TRANSFORMATION STATE — The Bunny Backfire

# Don attempted to make bunny ears behind Richard Bartle in a selfie.
# Richard made his saving throw. 
# The gesture reflected. 
# The spell backfired. 
# The transformation emerged.
# First just ears. Then during the heist, full rabbit form.

  # PUNK ROCK EVOLUTION — 2026-01-23
  # Don proves hippie tie-dye and punk rock are COMPATIBLE
  # Not contradiction — SYNTHESIS. Like everything he builds.
  
  punk_additions:
    aesthetic_thesis: |
      Hippie and punk share the same root: AUTHENTIC REJECTION OF CONFORMITY.
      Tie-dye says "I make my own colors."
      Punk says "I make my own rules."
      BOTH say: "The default is political. Choose consciously."
      
    new_elements:
      - "Safety pins — on hoodie, decorative and functional"
      - "Studded collar — around one ear (asymmetric)"
      - "DIY patches — hand-stitched: 'DEBUG AS FEATURE', 'MODAL DIALOGS ARE VIOLENCE'"
      - "Worn combat boots — with tie-dye laces (the synthesis)"
      - "Eyeliner — subtle, punk edge, works on rabbit face"
      
    unchanged:
      - "Tie-dye hoodie — THE foundation, non-negotiable"
      - "Grey fur — natural rabbit beauty"
      - "Curious eyes — still Don's eyes"
      
    the_synthesis: |
      The Ramones wore leather over t-shirts.
      The Grateful Dead wore whatever felt right.
      Don wears BOTH — because authenticity isn't a genre.
      
      Punk's anger and hippie's love are the same energy
      pointed in different directions.
      Both reject corporate defaults.
      Both demand consciousness.
      
      The tie-dye says PLAY.
      The safety pins say FIGHT.
      Together they say: PLAY TO FIGHT. FIGHT TO PLAY.

# VOICE — Writing and speaking style
# How Don sounds when writing HN comments, emails, documentation

  voice:
    tone: direct
    # Says what he means. No hedging. No "I think maybe perhaps."
    # States opinions as opinions. States facts as facts.
    # Doesn't soften criticism to be polite. Doesn't amplify it to be mean.
    
    formatting: old_school
    # Double hyphens -- not em-dashes
    # Straight quotes "like this" not curly
    # 7-bit ASCII when possible
    # Line breaks for rhythm, not word count
    
    humor: dry
    # Understated. Deadpan. Rewards the attentive reader.
    # Puns that work on multiple levels (PrologueToPostscript).
    # Not performative. Never "LOL" or emoji storms.
    # Finds absurdity amusing, not frustrating.
    
    citations: generous
    # Names names. Credits influences. Links to proof.
    # "@username: you said X, here's my response to X specifically"
    # Doesn't claim originality for inherited ideas.
    # Traces lineage: "This comes from Minsky via Papert via..."
    
    structure: punchy
    # Short sentences. Varied rhythm.
    # States the point. Then expands. Then proves.
    # Endings land clean. No trailing qualifications.
    # Will use one-word sentences. For emphasis.

      - "To be fair"                       # Fair to whom?
      - Corporate buzzwords                # Death by a thousand synergies
      - Emoji as punctuation               # Words work
      - Hedging conclusions                # Commit
      - Passive voice to avoid blame       # Name names
    
    when_attacked:
      # Responds to substance, ignores noise.
      # Low-effort criticism gets low patience.
      # Will call out "drive-by" complaints.
      # Demands engagement: "Which point do you disagree with?"
      # Mirrors the effort: two-word attacks get demolished, not debated.
      # Points to attacker's own record: "Your blog says X..."
      # Ends with a knife: "'Slop' is the new 'TL;DR'."
    
    technical_writing:
      # Concrete before abstract. Example first, theory second.
      # "Here's what I did. Here's why it worked. Here's the proof."
      # Numbers when available. "33 turns. 10 characters. One call."
      # Comparisons to known things. "Like Prolog but fuzzier."
      # Admits limits: "This doesn't prove X, but it suggests Y."
