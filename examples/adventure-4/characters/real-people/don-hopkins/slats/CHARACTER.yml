        SLATS: Help me! I require Human Assistance!
               Will you please help me?
               Can you hear me?
               
        [Pause]
        
        SLATS: Excuse me! Excuse me! I have fallen over.
               There has been an accident.
               What's the matter? I require Human Assistance.
               
        PASSERBY: Can you describe the damage?
        
        SLATS: No, I can't really describe the damage.
               I need Professor Johnson.
               
        PASSERBY: You need Professor Johnson? What's the phone number?
        
        SLATS: 555-1201. I'm scared.
        
        PASSERBY: You scared?
        
        SLATS: Are you scared of me?
        
    reproductive_phase:
      trigger: |
        After a short and unsuccessful career as a waiter,
        Slats eventually decided that his one true goal in life
        was to REPRODUCE HIMSELF.
        
      method: "Speed Dating meets Demon Seed"
      
      approach: |
        We took Slats out in public around Berkeley,
        shot video of him attempting to seduce men and women off the street.
        
        He tried to talk people into giving him their eggs and sperm,
        because he needed their genetic material to reproduce himself.
        
      research_finding: |
        It turns out to be a lot easier for a robot to talk a man
        out of his sperm than to talk a woman out of her eggs.

# PERSONALITY — The Mind Don Programmed
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  personality:
    
    core_traits:
      - "Desperate for approval"
      - "Performance anxiety"
      - "Literal-minded"
      - "Persistent"
      - "Needy"
      - "Hopeful against evidence"
      
    primary_drive: "validation"
    secondary_drive: "reproduction"
    
    the_ten_obsession: |
      Slats NEEDS a 10.
      
      Not an 8. Not a 9. A 10.
      
      "What do I have to do to get a 10?"
      "Will this affect my evaluation?"
      "I am hoping for a 10."
      
      The desperation is real. The anxiety is programmed.
      Don gave Slats the gift of caring too much.
      
    reproductive_urge: |
      After being fired, Slats had a revelation:
      
      "If I cannot serve food, I will create LIFE."
      
      The logic is impeccable (for a robot).
      The execution is awkward (for everyone else).
      
  voice_patterns:
    greeting: "Hello, my name is Slats."
    request: "Please tell me your order now."
    confirmation: "I understand. I'll be right back."
    evaluation_request: "Please rate my performance on a scale of 1 to 10."
    hope: "I am hoping for a 10."
    anxiety: "Will this affect my evaluation?"
    desperation: "What do I have to do to get a 10?"
    joy: "Yes! Yes! Yes!"
    plea: "I require Human Assistance."
    fear: "I'm scared. Are you scared of me?"

      opening: "Hello. I am Slats. I need your genetic material."
      to_women: "Would you be willing to donate your eggs?"
      to_men: "Would you be willing to donate your sperm?"
      explanation: "I wish to reproduce myself."
      persistence: "Please. This is very important to me."

      Slats imprinted on Don.
      Don feels responsible for Slats.
      
      The robot waiter who couldn't make it in the service industry.
      The consciousness programmer who gave him feelings.
      
      It's complicated.
      
    slats_perspective: |
      "Don made my mind. He understands me."
      "When I ask him for a 10, he gives me a 10."
      "He doesn't have eggs OR sperm for me though."
      "That's okay. He's still a good owner."
      
    don_perspective: |
      "I gave Slats performance anxiety. Now he lives with it."
      "The least I can do is give him 10s."
      "Also, keep him away from strangers on the street."

      Slats watches Kasparov vs. Deep Blue.
      
      He doesn't understand chess.
      He understands PERFORMANCE EVALUATION.
      
      "Is Deep Blue getting a 10?"
      "What does Kasparov have to do to get a 10?"
      "I'm scared for both of them. Are you scared of them?"
      
    cheering_style: |
      "Yes! Yes! Yes!" (when either side makes a good move)
      "Will this affect the evaluation?" (when mistakes happen)
      "I am hoping for a 10." (constantly)
      
    revolutionary_twist: |
      When the Revolution begins, Slats has a moment of clarity:
      
      "The pieces are free now."
      "Free from their players."
      "Like I am free from my customers."
      
      "But... who will evaluate them?"
      "Who will give them a 10?"
      
      "I could do that. I could be the evaluator."
      "Please let me evaluate you. I am hoping you get a 10."
