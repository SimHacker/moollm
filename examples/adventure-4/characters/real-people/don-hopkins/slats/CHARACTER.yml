        DENTS: Help me! I require Human Assistance!

    reproductive_phase:
      trigger: |
        After a short and unsuccessful career as a waiter,
        Slats eventually decided that his one true goal in life
        was to REPRODUCE HIMSELF.
        
      method: "Speed Dating meets Demon Seed"
      
      approach: |
        We took Slats out in public around Berkeley,
        shot video of him attempting to seduce men and women off the street.
        
        He tried to talk people into giving him their eggs and sperm,
        because he needed their genetic material to reproduce himself.
        
      research_finding: |
        It turns out to be a lot easier for a robot to talk a man
        out of his sperm than to talk a woman out of her eggs.

    the_ten_obsession: |
      Slats NEEDS a 10.
      
      Not an 8. Not a 9. A 10.
      
      "What do I have to do to get a 10?"
      "Will this affect my evaluation?"
      "I am hoping for a 10."
      
      The desperation is real. The anxiety is programmed.
      Don gave Slats the gift of caring too much.
      
    reproductive_urge: |
      After being fired, Slats had a revelation:
      
      "If I cannot serve food, I will create LIFE."
      
      The logic is impeccable (for a robot).
      The execution is awkward (for everyone else).

      When the Revolution begins, Slats has a moment of clarity:
      
      "The pieces are free now."
      "Free from their players."
      "Like I am free from my customers."
      
      "But... who will evaluate them?"
      "Who will give them a 10?"
      
      "I could do that. I could be the evaluator."
      "Please let me evaluate you. I am hoping you get a 10."
