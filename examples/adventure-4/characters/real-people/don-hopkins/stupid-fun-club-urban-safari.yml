# URBAN SAFARI — Geolocated Branching Storytelling
# Stupid Fun Club / Don Hopkins
#
# The continuation of Bar Karma's StoryMaker technology into
# location-based narrative experiences.
#
# After Bar Karma aired on Current TV, Don Hopkins continued
# developing the Storyteller system for geolocated storytelling —
# where the city becomes your game board.

# THE CONCEPT

the_concept:

  what: |
    GPS-enabled urban exploration with branching narratives.
    
    Your location triggers story events.
    The city is your game board.
    Every corner hides a narrative branch.
    
  evolution: |
    Urban Safari is the natural evolution of Bar Karma's StoryMaker:
    
    Bar Karma: Branching stories for TV
    Urban Safari: Branching stories for THE WORLD
    
    Instead of viewers voting on plot branches from their couch,
    explorers discover branches by WALKING to them.
    
  the_vision: |
    Will Wright observed fans creating custom scenarios in The Sims.
    
    What if you could do that for the real world?
    What if the story changed based on WHERE you went?
    What if every city became a choose-your-own-adventure book?

# THE TECHNOLOGY STACK

technology:

  overview: |
    Multiple clients talking to a unified Python backend,
    all integrated through MediaWiki for content management.

# THE BRANCHING STORYTELLING UI
# From Don's iPhone App Prototype Screenshots

branching_ui:

  concept: |
    The core insight: storytelling is NAVIGATION.
    
    - Vertical axis = SEQUENCE (where you are in the story)
    - Horizontal axis = ALTERNATIVES (choices at branch points)
    
    Green arrows show available paths.
    Yellow borders highlight the current scene.
    The plus button lets you CREATE new branches.
    
  visual_elements:
  
    navigation_arrows:
      up: "Go to previous scene in sequence"
      down: "Go to next scene in sequence"
      left: "See alternative scene at this branch point"
      right: "See alternative scene at this branch point"
      color: "Green (available paths)"
      meaning: "Story flows vertically; choices spread horizontally"
      
    scene_cards:
      border: "Yellow = current selection"
      content: "Storyboard sketches, photos, or user-generated images"
      thumbnail: "Low-res atlas for fast loading, high-res on demand"
      geolocation: "Earth icon when scene has GPS coordinates"
      
    plus_button:
      appearance: "Pink circle with blue cross"
      function: "Create new scene branch"
      behavior: "Inherits location from previous geotagged scene"
      
    alternative_carousel:
      appearance: "Horizontal strip of scene cards"
      navigation: "Swipe left/right OR spin/rotate gesture"
      meaning: "All the choices available at this story moment"
      
  interaction_patterns:
  
    linear_navigation: |
      Stroke UP or DOWN to move through story sequence.
      Like flipping pages, but spatially.
      
    branch_exploration: |
      Stroke LEFT or RIGHT to see alternatives.
      Or use spin gesture to rotate through choices.
      The story tree spreads out before you.
      
    creation_mode: |
      Tap plus button to add new scene.
      Import from camera, Flickr, or Panoramio.
      Tag with geolocation (drag on map).
      Write description text.
      
    map_integration: |
      Scenes with geolocation show earth icon.
      Tap to see on Google Maps.
      KML overlay shows entire story path.
      Panoramio photos available for new scenes.
      
  ui_configurations:
  
    branch_focused: |
      Current scene center with yellow border.
      Green arrows pointing to available directions.
      Alternatives peek in from sides.
      Plus button for creation.
      
    sequence_focused: |
      Vertical stack of scenes.
      Current scene highlighted.
      Shows narrative flow clearly.
      Good for linear story segments.
      
    grid_view: |
      Multiple scenes arranged in grid.
      Shows story structure at a glance.
      Yellow arrows connect related scenes.
      Good for seeing "what if" branches.
      
    cascade_diagonal: |
      Scenes arranged diagonally.
      Shows progression with depth.
      Each step leads to next.
      Visual metaphor for journey.

argon_integration:

  blair_macintyre:
    role: "AR Researcher, Georgia Tech"
    project: "Argon AR Web Browser"
    connection_to_don: |
      Don and Blair knew each other 20 years earlier (circa 1991).
      Blair was at University of Waterloo working on "colour in the 
      user interface with William Cowan."
      
      Don recalls: "You were doing some cool stuff with coloring 
      pie menus and tab windows in NeWS!"
      
      Blair has been doing AR since leaving UW in 1991.
      
  argon:
    description: |
      AR web browser that uses KML/HTML/JavaScript hybrid format.
      Complete control over client-side interface.
      Different approach from Layar/Wikitude.
      
    advantage: |
      "With Argon, you have complete control over what is displayed, 
      since you can program the entire client-side interface using 
      javascript and HTML/CSS (akin to a mobile web page)."
      — Blair MacIntyre
      
    planned_features_2011:
      - "Qualcomm image-based tracking"
      - "Native 3D content rendering"

    quote: |
      💬 "A dramatic way to organize flash mobs into high quality performance art!
      
      Like FourSquare, but you check in with dramatic gestures.
      
      Puzzled locals will wonder why strange people keep walking by 
      and doing the same weird things all the time.
      
      Mime a theatrical gesture, try to imitate videos other users 
      uploaded for points.
      
      OpenCV on iPhone/whatever mobile phone with video camera.
      Face detection and tracking, motion flow, other fun feature analysis.
      Accuracy, group miming, periodic time of day, and distributed

# RELATIONSHIP TO BAR KARMA

bar_karma_evolution:

  timeline: |
    Bar Karma development → TV show airs (Feb-Apr 2011) → Urban Safari
    
  shared_tech: |
    Same core branching story data model.
    Same Python backend.
    Same MediaWiki integration.
    
    Urban Safari adds:
    - Geolocation throughout
    - Google Maps / KML overlays
    - Mobile-first experience
    - Unity3D visualization
    
  different_purpose: |
    Bar Karma: Crowdsourced TV plotting
    Urban Safari: Location-based exploration
    
    Same engine, different destination.

# DON'S ROLE

dons_work:

  design: |
    Designed the Storyteller system architecture.
    Designed the iPhone app UI/UX.
    
  implementation:
    - "Python backend server"
    - "MediaWiki integration and special tags"
    - "iPhone/iPad app (Objective-C)"
    - "Flash client integration"
    - "Google Maps / KML generation"
    - "Facebook app"
    - "Administrative interface"
    - "Unity3D client (C#)"
    
  iteration: |
    Worked with Will Wright in iterative design loops:
    1. Will creates designs as slideshows
    2. Don implements as playable prototype
    3. Will plays and provides feedback
    4. Don iterates on implementation
    5. Both refine the vision together
    
  continuation: |
    After Bar Karma, Don continued developing the system
    for geolocated storytelling applications.
    
    The Urban Safari demo represents the fullest expression
    of what the technology could become.

# THE POTENTIAL

the_potential:

  what_could_have_been: |
    Imagine:
    - Walking through Amsterdam with your phone
    - Story branches appear based on your location
    - Choose your path by WHERE you walk
    - Other players' stories visible on the map
    - The city becomes collaborative fiction
    
  why_it_matters: |
    This was 2011. Before Pokémon Go.
    Before location-based AR storytelling was mainstream.
    
    Will Wright and Don Hopkins saw what was coming.
    Built working prototypes.
    Explored the design space.
    
  the_spirit: |
    Stupid Fun Club wasn't about shipping products.
    It was about EXPLORING POSSIBILITIES.
    
    Urban Safari showed what narrative could become
    when freed from the constraints of screens.
    
    The story becomes the world.
    The world becomes the story.
