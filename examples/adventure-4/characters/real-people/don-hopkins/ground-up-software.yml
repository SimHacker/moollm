# THE NAME

name:
  company: "Ground Up Software"
  tagline: "Building from the ground up"
  
  meanings: |
    The name carries multiple meanings, all intentional:
    
    1. FROM THE GROUND UP
       Building things properly, from first principles.
       No shortcuts. Foundation first.
       The way software should be built.
       
    2. ELECTRICAL GROUND ⏚
       The logo: electrical ground symbol, UPSIDE DOWN.
       Grounded. Connected to earth. Safe return path.
       But inverted — looking at grounding from a new angle.
       
    3. GROUND UP (like hamburger)
       Processed. Transformed. Made into something new.
       Raw ingredients become something useful.
       Code gets ground up and reconstituted.
       
    4. COFFEE GROUNDS
       What's left after brewing. The residue of process.
       Amsterdam coffee shops. Working at Bluebird.
       The grounds at the bottom of the cup.
       Reading the future in coffee grounds.
       
    5. GROUND (earth, land, territory)
       Claiming ground. Standing your ground.
       The ground you work from.
       Solid footing.
       
  logo: |
    ⏚ — Electrical ground symbol, inverted
    
    The standard ground symbol points down: ⏚
    Inverted, it points up: from the ground, UP.
    
    Simple. Memorable. Technical. Meaningful.

# AMSTERDAM ERA

amsterdam:

  context: |
    Don moved to Amsterdam for TomTom (2007-2009).
    
    But the best work happened in spare time —
    at Coffeeshop Bluebird, between TomTom Oosterdok
    and his flat overlooking Oosterpark.
    
    This is where iLoci was born.
    This is where Ground Up Software became real.
    
  location:
    work: "TomTom, Oosterdokseiland"
    creative: "Coffeeshop Bluebird"
    home: "Flat overlooking Oosterpark"
    
  the_triangle: |
    Oosterdok (TomTom) — Bluebird — Oosterpark
    
    The daily triangle of Amsterdam life.
    Work at TomTom. Create at Bluebird. Rest at Oosterpark.
    
    The independent projects happened in the spaces between.

# PROJECTS
#
# Independent projects developed under the Ground Up Software banner.
# Each has its own detailed file: ground-up-software-{project}.yml

projects:

  iloci:
    name: "iLoci"
    period: "2008"
    type: "iPhone app + web service"
    description: "Memory Palace app based on Method of Loci"
    see_also: "ground-up-software-iloci.yml"
    
  # Future projects can be added here with their own files
  
# CONNECTIONS

connections:

  to_sfc: |
    The iLoci project impressed Will Wright.
    It directly applied to the storytelling and geo-playing
    games that Stupid Fun Club wanted to develop.
    
    This led to Don rejoining Will at SFC —
    working remotely from Amsterdam, visiting Berkeley occasionally.
    
    Ground Up Software projects → Stupid Fun Club work.
    Independent creativity → collaborative production.
    
  to_moollm: |
    The core concepts from Ground Up Software projects
    flow directly into MOOLLM:
    
    iLoci → MOOLLM
    - Rooms as locations
    - Networks instead of hierarchies  
    - Navigation by gesture/direction
    - "Kiss to connect" editing
    - Memory Palace as organizing principle
    
    The lineage is clear:
    DreamScape (1995) → iLoci (2008) → MediaGraph (2012) → MOOLLM (now)
    
  to_leela: |
    Ground Up Software → Leela AI
    
    The same philosophy of building from first principles,
    owning your tools, and creating systems that empower users.
    
    Different company. Same spirit.
