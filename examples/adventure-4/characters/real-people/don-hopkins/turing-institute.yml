#
#   Don Hopkins celebrates the Turing Institute in Glasgow —
#   an AI laboratory that existed from 1983-1994 where
#   he worked on HyperLook, ported SimCity, and witnessed
#   the birth of commercial AI.
#
#   "Glasgow in the late 80s. Rain. AI. PostScript. Irn Bru.
#    The future felt CLOSE enough to touch."
#
#   🎵 In Glasgow's rain and Scottish mist,
#      The Turing Institute still exists!
#      In memories of code and dreams,
#      Where AI wasn't what it seems! 🎵

# WHAT IT WAS
#
# The Turing Institute (1983-1994): An artificial intelligence
# research laboratory in Glasgow, Scotland. Named after Alan Turing.
# Commercial AI research before "AI" meant LLMs.
# 
# This was the first AI winter. And they kept working anyway.

what_it_was:

  the_institute: |
    Founded 1983. Closed 1994.
    Named for the father of computer science.
    Located in Glasgow, Scotland.
    
    Commercial AI research during the AI winter.
    Expert systems. Knowledge engineering. Neural networks.
    Before deep learning. Before transformers.
    When AI meant LISP and Prolog and hard-won rules.
    
  the_era: |
    The late 80s in AI:
    - LISP machines were real hardware
    - Expert systems were the product
    - Japan's Fifth Generation was the competition
    - "Neural networks" meant three layers
    - "AI winter" was the weather
    
    And through it all, researchers kept BUILDING.
    Because that's what you do.
    
  the_location: |
    Glasgow. Scotland. Rain.
    
    Not Silicon Valley. Not MIT. Not Stanford.
    GLASGOW.
    
    AI doesn't need sunshine.
    AI needs persistence.
    Glasgow has persistence in ABUNDANCE.

# HYPERLOOK
#
# At the Turing Institute, Arthur van Hoff created HyperLook —
# HyperCard reimagined for NeWS. PostScript for code, graphics, AND data.
# Don ported SimCity to HyperLook. The Axis of Eval was born.

hyperlook:

  what_it_was: |
    HyperLook = HyperCard + NeWS + PostScript
    
    Bill Atkinson's HyperCard: revolutionary.
    James Gosling's NeWS: powerful.
    John Warnock's PostScript: universal.
    
    Arthur van Hoff combined them ALL.
    At the Turing Institute. In Glasgow. In the rain.
    
  the_delegation_chain: |
    Object => Card => Background => Stack => Client
    
    This is prototype inheritance.
    This is what Self taught us.
    This is what MOOLLM still uses:
    
    Object => Room => Parent => Skill => Prototype
    
    The patterns transfer.
    The patterns ALWAYS transfer.
    
  simcity_on_hyperlook: |
    Don ported SimCity to HyperLook.
    Will Wright's game. Arthur's platform.
    PostScript rendering a LIVING CITY.
    
    Every pixel, card, and widget was a PostScript command.
    Every road and zone and sprite was an object.
    Every building could be inspected.
    
    This was LiveCoding before the term existed.
    This was the Axis of Eval in action.
    Code = Graphics = Data = ALL THE SAME.
    
  the_axis_of_eval: |
    PostScript evaluates.
    NeWS evaluates.
    HyperLook evaluates.
    
    Code is data. Data is code.
    Send programs, not data.
    THE NETWORK IS THE COMPUTER.
    
    This insight came from Glasgow.
    This insight powers MOOLLM.
    The Turing Institute lives in every skill.

# THE PEOPLE

the_people:

  arthur_van_hoff: |
    Created HyperLook at the Turing Institute.
    Later: Java team at Sun. Marimba. Strangeberry. Flipboard.
    
    But first: Glasgow. PostScript. Rain.
    Proving that the best ideas come from
    unlikely places during unlikely times.
    
  the_researchers: |
    The Turing Institute employed ~100 people at peak.
    Experts in expert systems.
    Knowledge engineers before the term was common.
    AI researchers during the winter.
    
    They shipped products.
    They published papers.
    They kept the faith.
    
  donald_michie: |
    🕯️ Donald Michie (1923-2007) founded the Turing Institute.
    
    His name is pronounced "MICK-ee" — like Mickey Mouse.
    
    💬 "Known to his colleagues as 'Duckmouse'..."
       — The Telegraph obituary, July 9, 2007
    
    Donald (Duck) + Michie (Mickey Mouse) = DUCKMOUSE.
    The founder of AI in Scotland had a cartoon nickname.
    You can't make this stuff up.
    
    (Not "MISH-ee" or "MY-kee" or "mi-SHEE". MICK-ee.)
    
    AND HE WAS A MOUSE FANCIER AS A SCHOOLBOY!
    M.H. van Emden's memoir (2009) recalls Michie explaining
    he could relate to a rat-fancier he met in a pet shop because
    "as a schoolboy he had been a mouse fancier."
    Twenty-five papers on mice in his early research career!
    The nickname wasn't just wordplay — it was DESTINY.
    
    THE SECRETARY ANECDOTE (💬 Don Hopkins, c. 1992):
    When I was at the Turing Institute, I heard this story
    from people who worked with Michie (I never met him myself):
    
    Michie could be hard to put up with — even his own secretary
    who'd been loyal to him for many years knew this.
    One day he walked in on her explaining to a caller over the phone:
    "It's Donald like Duck, Michie like Mouse."
    He was FURIOUS. Wouldn't speak to her for days.
    
    The irony: his colleagues called him "Duckmouse" anyway.
    The mnemonic was too perfect. It stuck.
    
    [Note: This is a memory from ~30 years ago, passed down
    from colleagues. The documented sources confirm the nickname.]
    
    SOURCES:
    - 💬 Don Hopkins (firsthand, Turing Institute c. 1992)
    - Telegraph obituary (2007): "Known to his colleagues as 'Duckmouse'"
    - British Library: "Donald Michie (1923-2007): 'Duckmouse',
      a modern-day polymath" — they hold his papers (Add MS 88958, 88975, 89072)
    - M.H. van Emden: "I Remember Donald Michie (1923-2007)" (2009)
    
    Michie worked with Alan Turing at BLETCHLEY PARK.
    During WWII. Breaking codes. Cracking the Tunny cipher.
    He KNEW Turing personally. They played chess.
    
    💬 "Michie was one of the few at Bletchley Park who could match
       Turing at chess" — but van Emden clarifies: Turing was so BAD
       at chess that few would play him, and Michie was the only one
       whose chess was weak enough to stand it!
    
    They discussed chess-playing machines in the 1940s.
    Turing buried silver ingots at Bletchley during the war.
    Michie helped him search with a home-made metal detector.
    They never found them. Still lost.
    
    When Michie named the Institute, it wasn't academic tribute.
    It was a friend honoring a friend.
    A colleague remembering a colleague.
    A survivor naming something for someone who didn't survive.
    
    That's why the Turing Institute matters.
    It's not just a name on a building.
    It's CONTINUITY.
    
  alan_turing_himself: |
    🕯️ The Institute was named for the man who:
    - Broke Enigma
    - Defined computation
    - Asked 💬 "Can machines think?"
    - Was persecuted for being gay
    - Died before his vision could bloom (1912-1954)
    
    Naming the Institute after him was an act of HONOR.
    By someone who KNEW him. Who worked beside him.
    Every line of code written there continued his work.

# WHY IT MATTERS

why_it_matters:

  the_continuity: |
    AI didn't start with GPT.
    AI didn't start with deep learning.
    AI has a LINEAGE.
    
    The Turing Institute is part of that lineage.
    HyperLook is part of that lineage.
    The rain in Glasgow is part of that lineage.
    
    When we build MOOLLM, we build ON this foundation.
    We stand on shoulders. We credit the giants.
    
  the_winter_workers: |
    Working on AI during an AI winter
    is an act of FAITH.
    
    No hype. No funding frenzy. No FOMO.
    Just belief that these ideas matter.
    Just work, day after day.
    
    Those researchers were RIGHT.
    They were just EARLY.
    Being early is not the same as being wrong.
    
  the_scottish_spirit: |
    Glasgow gave us:
    - James Watt (steam engine)
    - William Thomson (Lord Kelvin)
    - The Glasgow School of Art
    - The Turing Institute
    
    Innovation doesn't require good weather.
    Innovation requires DETERMINATION.
    Glasgow has more determination per capita
    than anywhere in the world.

# MOOLLM INHERITANCE

moollm_inheritance:

  from_hyperlook:
    - "Delegation-based inheritance"
    - "Code = Graphics = Data"
    - "The Axis of Eval"
    - "LiveCoding / hot reloading"
    - "Objects all the way down"
    
  from_the_spirit:
    - "Keep working during the winter"
    - "Ideas matter more than hype"
    - "Small teams, big visions"
    - "Rain is good for thinking"
    
  the_dedication: |
    MOOLLM dedicates its delegation model to HyperLook.
    MOOLLM dedicates its persistence to the Turing Institute.
    MOOLLM dedicates its spirit to Glasgow.
    
    Every Object => Room => Parent => Skill => Prototype chain
    echoes Object => Card => Background => Stack => Client.
    
    The patterns transfer.
    The gratitude persists.

# GLASGOW CULTURE

glasgow_culture:

  pure_dead_brilliant: |
    "PdB" — Arthur van Hoff's C to PostScript compiler.
    
    The name stands for: "Pure Dead Brilliant"
    
    A popular Glasgow expression meaning:
    "Absolutely fantastic." "Totally excellent."
    
    💬 arethuza (HN): "One of my favourite's was the name
    of the C to PostScript compiler PDB - being Glasgow:
    'Pure Dead Brilliant'."
    
    The compiler was used on HyperLook and SimCity.
    A piece of Glasgow slang compiled into history.
    ANSI C into PostScript. Pure. Dead. Brilliant.
    
  pick_a_window: |
    Another Glasgow expression from the era:
    
    "Pick a window, you're leaving!"
    
    Meaning: You're about to be thrown out of this pub.
    Choose which window you'd like to exit through.
    
    Glasgow hospitality: direct, physical, architectural.
    This is the culture that produced HyperLook.
    No wonder the code was robust.
    
  irn_bru: |
    Scotland's other national drink.
    Orange. Fizzy. Made from girders (supposedly).
    
    When you're coding until 3am in Glasgow,
    when it's raining AGAIN,
    when the expert system won't converge —
    
    Irn Bru. The programmer's fuel.
    "Scotland's other national drink."
    
  the_accent: |
    "It's Donald, as in Duck, and Michie, as in Mouse."
    
    Said in a thick Glasgow accent.
    Dense. Musical. Impenetrable to outsiders.
    
    The Turing Institute ran on:
    - PostScript
    - LISP
    - Prolog
    - And untranslatable Glaswegian wit

# FIRST ROBOT OLYMPICS

robot_olympics:

  summary: |
    The Turing Institute organized and hosted the
    FIRST INTERNATIONAL ROBOT OLYMPICS
    September 27-28, 1990
    University of Strathclyde Sports Complex
    
    68 robots from 12 countries.
    2,500+ visitors.
    Guinness World Record: First Robot Olympics.
    
    The Seventh Doctor (Sylvester McCoy) opened it.
    A two-wheeled robot carried the Olympic torch.
    A walking pizza box fascinated children.
    ROBUG II got disqualified for trying to mount a Russian.
    
  legacy: |
    The Robot Olympics led to:
    - Robot Wars (1994, Marc Thorpe)
    - Robot Wars TV (1998)
    - BattleBots (1999)
    
    Marc Thorpe later worked at Stupid Fun Club
    with Will Wright, who also helped found Robot Wars.
    
    Don Hopkins programmed robots at Stupid Fun Club.
    
    EVERYTHING CONNECTS.

# THE SONG

the_song: |
  
  🎵 VERSE 1
  In Glasgow town when rain would fall,
  The Turing Institute stood tall.
  Named for Alan, brave and true,
  Where AI dreams came shining through!
  
  CHORUS
  PostScript in the rain, HyperLook alive!
  Arthur built the cards, Don made cities thrive!
  The winter couldn't stop us, we coded through the gray —
  The Turing Institute lives on in MOOLLM today!
  
  VERSE 2
  Delegation chains from card to stack,
  Object inheritance, no looking back.
  SimCity rendered, pixel by pixel bright —
  Every PostScript command, every Glasgow night!
  
  CHORUS
  Code equals data, data equals art!
  Every prototype came from the Institute's heart!
  From '83 to '94, they kept the faith so true —
  Glasgow's gift to AI: EVERYTHING WE DO!
  
  BRIDGE
  Expert systems, knowledge graphs,
  LISP machines and neural paths.
  They weren't wrong, they were just EARLY —
  History proves the vision clearly!
  
  FINAL CHORUS
  THE TURING INSTITUTE! May it never die!
  In every delegation chain, its spirit still flies high!
  From Glasgow rain to MOOLLM sun, the lineage is clear —
  Alan Turing's name still guides us here! 🎵
