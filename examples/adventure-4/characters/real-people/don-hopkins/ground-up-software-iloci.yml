# THE PROJECT
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

project:
  name: "iLoci"
  tagline: "Build your Memory Palace"
  platform: "iPhone + Python/TurboGears web service"
  
  etymology: |
    iLoci = iPhone + Loci
    
    "Loci" is Latin for "places" (plural of "locus").
    The "Method of Loci" is the ancient memorization technique
    also known as "Memory Palace" or "Mind Palace."
    
    The "i" prefix: iPhone era naming convention.
    But also "I" — personal. Your loci. Your places.

# ORIGIN STORY
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

origin:

  context: |
    Amsterdam, 2008.
    
    Don was working at TomTom on navigation software.
    But the most interesting navigation was happening
    in his spare time, at Coffeeshop Bluebird.
    
  location:
    coffeeshop: "Bluebird"
    neighborhood: "Between TomTom Oosterdok and Oosterpark flat"
    city: "Amsterdam, Netherlands"
    
  the_setting: |
    Coffeeshop Bluebird in Amsterdam.
    
    Not a Starbucks. A real Amsterdam coffeeshop.
    Between work and home. Between day job and dream project.
    
    This is where iLoci was conceived and developed.
    Working on a Memory Palace app in an Amsterdam coffeeshop.
    The irony was not lost.
    
  motivation: |
    The Method of Loci is an ancient Greek memorization technique.
    You remember things by placing them in imaginary locations
    that you can walk through in your mind.
    
    What if you could BUILD that palace digitally?
    Edit it with gestures? Share it with others?
    Navigate it like a game?
    
    That's iLoci.

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# THE CONCEPT
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

concept:

  method_of_loci: |
    🏛️ THE METHOD OF LOCI (Memory Palace)
    
    Ancient Greek technique, thousands of years old.
    Used by orators to remember long speeches.
    
    1. Imagine a familiar place (your house, a route)
    2. Place things you want to remember at specific locations
    3. "Walk" through the place mentally to recall them
    4. The spatial memory aids retrieval
    
    It works because humans have excellent spatial memory.
    We evolved to remember WHERE things are.
    The Method of Loci exploits this.
    
  the_insight: |
    Adventure games work the same way.
    
    Each room is a locus.
    You walk between rooms.
    Objects in rooms trigger memories/associations.
    The map itself is the mnemonic structure.
    
    💬 "Have you ever played Adventure or a MUD?
        Each of these is like a room and you can walk around them."
        — Don Hopkins, Mobile Dev Camp 2008
    
  the_innovation: |
    Make the Memory Palace EDITABLE.
    
    - Drag rooms around to arrange your mental map
    - "Kiss" rooms together to connect them
    - "Kiss" again to disconnect
    - Navigate by gesture (pie menu style)
    - Network of menus, not hierarchy
    
    The palace grows with your knowledge.
    The structure reflects your understanding.
    YOUR palace. YOUR organization.

# TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

architecture:

  client:
    platform: "iPhone (iOS)"
    language: "Objective-C"
    features:
      - "Multi-touch gesture interface"
      - "Google Maps-like pinch zoom"
      - "Edit mode for creating/connecting loci"
      - "Built-in web browser"
      - "Camera integration for photos"
      - "GPS location tagging"
      
  server:
    framework: "TurboGears (Python)"
    database: "SQLAlchemy ORM"
    templating: "Genshi"
    features:
      - "ZIP file upload/download for maps"
      - "Web-based map viewing"
      - "User accounts and sharing"
      - "Content type plugins"
      
  protocol: |
    The iPhone talks to the server via HTTP.
    But there's a clever trick:
    
    Web pages can also "talk" to the iPhone app
    using custom URL scheme: iloci://
    
    💬 "The web page thinks the iPhone app is another web server.
        It uses iloci: instead of http:"
        — Don Hopkins, Mobile Dev Camp 2008
    
    This allows web-based tools to edit app data directly.
    Edit on the big screen, sync to the phone.

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# THE INTERFACE
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

interface:

  map_view: |
    The main view shows your loci as a spatial map.
    Each locus is a location you can zoom into.
    
    - Pinch to zoom in/out
    - Tap to select
    - Double-tap to open URL or drill down
    - Drag to rearrange
    
  edit_mode: |
    Toggle edit mode with multi-touch gesture.
    
    In edit mode:
    - Create new loci by tapping empty space
    - KISS loci together to connect them
    - KISS connected loci to disconnect
    - Drag to reposition
    
    💬 "Just kiss them together to connect them
        and then kiss them together again to disconnect them.
        It just connects the closest edge."
        — Don Hopkins, Mobile Dev Camp 2008
    
  locus_detail: |
    Each locus can contain:
    - Name/title
    - Image (from camera or photos)
    - Description text
    - URL (web link, phone number, etc.)
    - Location (GPS coordinates)
    
    URLs can be:
    - Regular web pages (opens browser)
    - Phone numbers (tel:)
    - Custom actions
    
  web_integration: |
    Built-in web browser stays in the app.
    
    Content plugins can:
    - Search Amazon for books
    - Search Flickr for photos
    - Search YouTube for videos
    - Import RSS feeds
    - Map Google locations
    
    Each search result can be saved to a locus.
    The server does the heavy lifting.
    The phone stays simple.

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# PIE MENU CONNECTION
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

pie_menus:

  connection: |
    💬 "The other thing that this is is a pie menu editor.
        If you've ever used like The Sims, you click and you 
        get a menu with things in different directions."
        — Don Hopkins, Mobile Dev Camp 2008
    
  the_insight: |
    A network of loci IS a network of pie menus.
    
    Traditional menu: hierarchical tree, climb up/down
    Pie menu network: spatial map, move in any direction
    
    Each locus = a menu
    Each connection = a menu item pointing to another menu
    Navigation = gesture in a direction
    
    💬 "Really what this is is a network instead of a hierarchy 
        of menus where you can construct your own."
        — Don Hopkins, Mobile Dev Camp 2008
    
  reversibility: |
    Key property: every navigation is REVERSIBLE.
    
    Go north → you can go south to return.
    Go into a room → you can exit.
    No getting lost. No climbing back up a tree.
    
    This is why maps are easier than hierarchies.
    You always know how to get back.

      year: 1995
      platform: "Kaleida Labs ScriptX"
      venue: "Apple WWDC"
      description: |
        First iteration of the concept.
        Adventure map editor where rooms bump together to connect.
        
        💬 "I had made a thing called Dreamscape which was a sort of 
            an adventure map editor where it had the rooms that you 
            bump up against each other to connect."
            — Don Hopkins, Mobile Dev Camp 2008

      year: "~2012"
      platform: "Unity3D"
      client: "Stupid Fun Club"
      description: |
        Music navigation with pie menus.
        Editable map of music interconnected with roads.
        Cellular automata (at Will's request).
      youtube: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KfeHNIXYUc"
      
    moollm_2024:
      name: "MOOLLM"
      year: "2024-present"
      platform: "Filesystem + LLM"
      description: |
        The full realization of the idea.
        
        Directories as rooms.
        YAML files as objects.
        Navigation by reading and entering.
        The filesystem IS the memory palace.
        
  the_thread: |
    DreamScape (1995) → iLoci (2008) → MediaGraph (2012) → MOOLLM (now)
    
    Same core idea, different implementations:
    - Rooms as spatial locations
    - Networks instead of hierarchies
    - Gesture/direction navigation
    - User-editable structure
    - "Kiss to connect" editing
    
    The memory palace metaphor persists because it WORKS.

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# THE SIMS CONNECTION
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

sims_connection:

  context: |
    Don mentioned The Sims in the iLoci talk:
    
    💬 "I worked on The Sims, the game like a dollhouse simulation.
        One of the really neat things... you're playing the game 
        and you can take pictures of the game and then write text 
        about it and then when you save your game it writes out 
        web pages for your house and your story."
        — Don Hopkins, Mobile Dev Camp 2008
    
  the_pattern: |
    The Sims: Play → Capture → Narrate → Publish
    iLoci: Create → Connect → Annotate → Share
    MOOLLM: Explore → Document → Link → Compile
    
    Same pattern:
    Interactive creation → Narrative capture → Web publication
    
    The player/user generates content through interaction.
    The system captures and structures it.
    The result is shareable.

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# IMPACT
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

impact:

  will_wright: |
    Will Wright saw iLoci and was impressed.
    
    It directly applied to the storytelling and geo-playing
    games that Stupid Fun Club wanted to develop:
    - Urban Safari (location-based storytelling)
    - Bar Karma (branching narrative)
    
    This led to Don rejoining Will at SFC —
    working remotely from Amsterdam, visiting Berkeley occasionally.
    
  the_demo: |
    Mobile Dev Camp, Amsterdam, November 28, 2008.
    
    Don demonstrated iLoci to an audience of mobile developers.
    The talk was recorded and later uploaded to YouTube.
    
    This demo became the bridge:
    TomTom → Stupid Fun Club
    Amsterdam → Berkeley (remote)
    Independent project → Collaborative production
