    venue: "Mobile Dev Camp"
    location: "Amsterdam, Netherlands"

    context: |
      🗣️ Developed while working at TomTom, in spare time at
      Coffeeshop Bluebird in Amsterdam (between TomTom Oosterdok
      and Don's flat overlooking Oosterpark).
      
      Will Wright was impressed because it directly applied to
      the storytelling and geoplaying games SFC wanted to do.
      This led to Don rejoining Will at SFC remotely.

    # From the transcript:
    quotes:
      - quote: |
          💬 "Each of these is like a room and you can walk around them...
          really what this is is a network instead of a hierarchy of menus...
          you can construct your own by going into edit mode...
          just kiss them together to connect them." —Don Hopkins, Mobile Dev Camp 2008
      - quote: |
          💬 "I had made a thing called Dreamscape which was a sort of an 
          adventure map editor where it had the rooms that you bump up 
          against each other to connect." —Don Hopkins, Mobile Dev Camp 2008
      - quote: |
          💬 "I worked on the Sims... one of the really neat things...
          you're playing the game and you can take pictures... write text 
          about it and then... it writes out web pages for your house and 
          your story." —Don Hopkins, Mobile Dev Camp 2008

# PROTOTYPES & DEMOS (for Will Wright / SFC)

prototypes:

    title: "MediaGraph Music Navigation with Pie Menus"
    date: "~2012"
    client: "Will Wright's Stupid Fun Club"
    platform: "Unity3D"
    content: |
      UI research prototype combining:
      - Pie menus
      - Editable map of music interconnected with roads
      - Cellular automata (at Will's request)
      
      Uses one kind of nested hierarchical pie menu to build
      and edit another kind of geographic networked pie menu.

  moollm_connection: |
    The same way you navigate a map and create story frames or "rooms" 
    at geographic locations, connecting them with storytelling arcs —
    this is exactly what MOOLLM does with directories and YAML files.
    
    The lineage is direct: DreamScape → iLoci → MediaGraph → MOOLLM.
    
    💬 "Each of these is like a room and you can walk around them."
    —Don Hopkins, explaining the core concept that became MOOLLM
