    The front of the motorcoach is dominated by a massive panoramic 
    windshield that provides a 180-degree view of the world outside.
    Two large, comfortable bucket seats sit like throne-chairs on either 
    side of the central console.
    
    The dashboard is a masterpiece of 1970s instrumentation, updated with
    modern parameters and a purple glow. A wide counter extends over the 
    dash, perfect for coffee and rabbit snacks.

  atmosphere: |
    Command-center energy mixed with the anticipation of the open road.
    The large glass area makes it bright and airy.
