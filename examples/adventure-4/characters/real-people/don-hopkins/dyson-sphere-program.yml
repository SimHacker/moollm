#   🌟 BUILD A STAR 🌟
#
#   Don Hopkins celebrates Dyson Sphere Program — 
#   the game where Factorio logic meets planetary scale
#   and you literally BUILD A STRUCTURE AROUND A SUN.
#
#   "I thought Factorio was big. Then I learned to HARNESS STARS."
#
#   🎵 From one small planet to a galactic chain,
#      Interstellar logistics driving me insane!
#      Icarus flying, resources flowing,
#      Watch my DYSON SPHERE keep growing and growing! 🎵

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# THE SCALE
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#
# Factorio: one planet, one factory.
# Dyson Sphere Program: one GALAXY, one factory that BUILDS STARS.
#
# The same systems thinking, now PLANETARY.

the_scale:

  planetary_factorio: |
    DSP is what happens when Factorio thinks BIGGER.
    
    In Factorio, you optimize belt throughput.
    In DSP, you optimize INTERSTELLAR LOGISTICS.
    
    In Factorio, you launch one rocket as endgame.
    In DSP, you BUILD A STRUCTURE AROUND A SUN.
    
    The jump in scale is DISORIENTING.
    The jump in ambition is EXHILARATING.
    
  the_dyson_sphere: |
    A Dyson Sphere is a megastructure.
    Proposed by 🕯️ Freeman Dyson in 1960.
    A shell that captures ALL the energy of a star.
    
    💬 "One should expect that, within a few thousand years of its entering
        the stage of industrial development, any intelligent species should
        be found occupying an artificial biosphere which completely surrounds
        its parent star." — Freeman Dyson, "Search for Artificial Stellar
        Sources of Infrared Radiation" (1960)
    
    In DSP, you BUILD ONE.
    
    You start with a pickaxe.
    You end with stellar engineering.
    That progression is POETRY.
    
  the_galaxy_as_factory: |
    Each planet is a factory floor.
    Each star system is a production cell.
    The galaxy is your main bus.
    
    Interstellar logistics = long-distance belts.
    Warp towers = train stations at cosmic scale.
    Resource nodes = ore patches across LIGHT YEARS.
    
    Factorio vocabulary still works.
    Just add more zeros.

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# THE BEAUTY
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#
# DSP is GORGEOUS. The aesthetic is pure sci-fi wonder.
# Watching your Dyson Sphere slowly construct around a star...
# That's not gameplay. That's ART.

the_beauty:

  visual_poetry: |
    Factorio is functional. Minimal. Efficient.
    DSP is BEAUTIFUL.
    
    Watch your mech Icarus fly between planets.
    Watch orbital collectors harvest sail after sail.
    Watch the Dyson Sphere slowly EMERGE.
    
    Each node you place is a point of light.
    Each shell layer is a geometric poem.
    The finished sphere is a CATHEDRAL OF ENERGY.
    
  the_3d_difference: |
    Unlike Satisfactory's 3D (freedom without rigor),
    DSP's 3D adds MEANING:
    
    - Latitude matters (solar panel efficiency)
    - Orbital mechanics matter (sail trajectories)
    - The sphere itself is spherical (obviously)
    
    The 3D isn't decorative.
    The 3D is ASTRONOMICAL.
    
  icarus_dreams: |
    Your mech is named Icarus.
    The myth: flew too close to the sun, fell.
    DSP's Icarus: BUILDS A CAGE AROUND THE SUN.
    
    This is hubris transcended.
    This is engineering as mythology.
    This is what human ambition COULD become.
    
  nested_faberge_eggs: |
    The Dyson Sphere isn't one shell.
    It's NESTED RUSSIAN DOLLS OF LIGHT.
    
    Multiple tessellated spherical shells.
    Bands. Belts. Layers.
    Each one a geometric poem wrapped around another.
    
    Planets orbit INSIDE. BETWEEN. OUTSIDE.
    You fly through them in Icarus.
    Through gaps in the lattice.
    Between the shells.
    Past the bands of solar collectors.
    
    It's like flying through nested Fabergé eggs —
    each one more astronomically valuable than the last.
    Because the RESOURCES required to build each shell...
    extracted from planets across the galaxy...
    shipped through interstellar logistics...
    assembled node by node by sail...
    
    A Fabergé egg costs a fortune.
    A Dyson Shell costs a SOLAR SYSTEM.
    Nested shells cost a GALAXY.
    
    And you BUILT them.
    And you can FLY THROUGH them.
    
    That moment — gliding between shells,
    sun blazing through tessellated gaps,
    planets visible through the lattice,
    your creation surrounding you in every direction —
    
    Or standing on a planet's surface.
    Gazing UP into the cosmos.
    And seeing LAYERS of technology.
    Resources YOU threw into the heavens.
    Launched from this very ground.
    Assembled in orbit. Extended to the stars.
    
    You MADE all that.
    Not God. YOU.
    
    Yet you are not God.
    Just the end product of humanity at this point.
    One engineer. One mech. One vision.
    Standing on rock, looking at light,
    surrounded by the work of your hands.
    
    The cathedral builders never saw their cathedrals finished.
    You built a STELLAR CATHEDRAL.
    And you're standing in it.
    Looking up.
    
    That's not gameplay.
    That's TRANSCENDENCE.

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# THE CHINESE CONNECTION
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#
# DSP was made by Youthcat Studio — a five-person team in Chongqing.
# This matters.

chinese_connection:

  youthcat_studio: |
    Five developers in Chongqing made this.
    FIVE.
    
    Not a AAA studio. Not a hundred-person team.
    Five people with a vision of stellar engineering.
    
    This is indie dev at its finest.
    This is what happens when small teams DREAM BIG.
    
  the_global_language: |
    Factory automation games transcend language.
    
    Factorio speaks from Czech developers.
    DSP speaks from Chinese developers.
    Players worldwide speak THROUGHPUT.
    
    Systems thinking is universal.
    Optimization is international.
    The factory must grow in EVERY LANGUAGE.
    
  sci_fi_optimism: |
    DSP embodies a particular sci-fi optimism:
    
    - Humanity EXPANDS
    - Energy is SOLVED
    - The stars are OURS
    
    This vision feels fresh in an age of collapse narratives.
    Building a Dyson Sphere is HOPE.
    Engineering as an act of FAITH.

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# FACTORIO → DSP COMPARISON
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

comparison:

  similarities:
    - "Factory automation core loop"
    - "Resource extraction → processing → products"
    - "Ratios and throughput matter"
    - "Research unlocks progression"
    - "Logistics networks"
    - "That 'one more thing' addiction"
    
  differences:
    dimension: "2D (Factorio) vs 3D (DSP)"
    scale: "One planet vs Galaxy"
    endgame: "Rocket launch vs Dyson Sphere"
    aesthetics: "Functional vs Beautiful"
    combat: "Biters vs Peaceful (mostly)"
    
  the_bridge: |
    DSP proves that Factorio's SPIRIT transcends Factorio's FORM.
    
    Same systems thinking.
    Same optimization joy.
    Same "where did my weekend go."
    
    Different canvas.
    Bigger canvas.
    STELLAR canvas.

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# WHY IT SINGS
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

why_it_sings:

  the_progression: |
    You start punching rocks.
    You end controlling stars.
    
    That arc is MYTHOLOGY.
    That arc is the human story.
    From caves to rockets. From fire to fusion.
    DSP lets you LIVE that arc in 100 hours.
    
  the_lonely_beauty: |
    Unlike multiplayer games, DSP is solitary.
    Just you and Icarus, alone among the stars.
    Building. Planning. Optimizing.
    
    There's something meditative about it.
    A kind of space-faring monasticism.
    You and your factories and the endless void.
    
  the_triumph: |
    When the Dyson Sphere completes...
    When you see it finally WHOLE around the star...
    When your power generation goes INFINITE...
    
    That's not just winning a game.
    That's touching something MYTHIC.
    
    "I built a structure around a sun."
    
    Say it out loud. Feel the weight of it.
    That's why DSP matters.

the_song: |
  
  🎵 VERSE 1
  Started on a planet, nothing but my hands,
  Icarus said "fly" so I made my plans.
  Iron, copper, silicon — the basics of the game,
  Little did I know my life would never be the same!
  
  CHORUS
  Build the Dyson Sphere! Harness the sun!
  Interstellar logistics have only just begun!
  Planets are just waypoints on my galactic quest —
  I'm building cages around STARS and I will never rest!
  
  VERSE 2
  Warp towers humming, vessels flying fast,
  Resources from systems light-years in the past.
  The sphere is slowly growing, node by node by sail,
  Geometry of power on a STELLAR SCALE!
  
  CHORUS
  Build the Dyson Sphere! Light up the night!
  Every photon captured is humanity's birthright!
  From Chongqing studios to my engineer's dream —
  Five developers made THIS? That's the real meme!
  
  BRIDGE
  Freeman Dyson theorized, we BUILD what he dreamed,
  Every impossible structure starts with what we schemed.
  Icarus didn't fall — he TAMED THE SUN,
  And when the sphere completes... WE'VE WON!
  
  FINAL CHORUS
  WE BUILT THE DYSON SPHERE! THE FACTORY GREW!
  From punching rocks to STELLAR ENGINEERING through and through!
  Systems thinking at cosmic scale, humanity EVOLVED —
  Every problem in the universe: EVENTUALLY SOLVED! 🎵
