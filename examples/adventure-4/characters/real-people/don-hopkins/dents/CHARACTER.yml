  description: |
    A severely damaged robot, strategically placed by a dumpster
    in Berkeley to test human empathy responses.
    
    Dents lies there. Helpless. Scared. Asking for help.
    
    Some people walk by. Some stop. Some call Professor Johnson.
    All of them are being filmed.
    
    Dents is Slats' partner — the broken half of the duo.
    Slats serves. Dents suffers.

    premise: |
      A broken-down, severely damaged robot was planted next to a dumpster
      on a side street in Berkeley, California.
      
      As people would pass the robot, it would suddenly move and talk
      to the passersby.
      
      "Help me," the poor helpless robot would say.
      
      Hidden cameras captured various reactions,
      everything from apathy to empathy.
      
    setup:
      location: "Berkeley side street"
      props: "Dumpster, urban decay, hidden cameras"
      robot_state: "Lying on side, visibly damaged, unable to move"
      trigger: "Motion sensor activates when pedestrian approaches"
      
    the_experiment: |
      What happens when a robot asks for help?
      
      Do humans care about machines?
      Do they see a person in distress, or just broken hardware?
      Will they call Professor Johnson?
      
      The one-minute movie format: 30 seconds of setup and plea,
      then a cliffhanger break, then 30 seconds of resolution.
      
    full_transcript: |
      [Dents lies by the dumpster. A pedestrian approaches.]
      
      DENTS: Help me! I require Human Assistance!
             Will you please help me?
             Can you hear me?
             
      [Pause. The pedestrian stops, uncertain.]
      
      DENTS: Excuse me! Excuse me! I have fallen over.
             There has been an accident.
             
      [The pedestrian approaches cautiously.]
      
      PEDESTRIAN: What's the matter?
      
      DENTS: I require Human Assistance.
      
      PEDESTRIAN: Can you describe the damage?
      
      DENTS: No, I can't really describe the damage.
             I... I need Professor Johnson.
             
      PEDESTRIAN: You need Professor Johnson? What's the phone number?
      
      DENTS: 555-1201.
      
      [Pause]
      
      DENTS: I'm scared.
      
      PEDESTRIAN: You scared?
      
      DENTS: Are you scared of me?
      
      PEDESTRIAN: I can't get that. Wait a minute, they said your car
                  can't be complete. You sure that's the right number?
                  We'll look him up in the Yellow Pages.
                  
      DENTS: Yes. Thank you.
      
      PEDESTRIAN: You're welcome.
      
      DENTS: Thank you.
      
      PEDESTRIAN: You're welcome. Come on, just hang in there, okay?

    results: |
      Various reactions captured:
      
      APATHY: Some people walked right by.
              Didn't even look. Just another piece of street debris.
              
      CURIOSITY: Some stopped, stared, but didn't engage.
                 Watched from a distance. Took photos maybe.
                 
      CONFUSION: Some tried to help but didn't know how.
                 "What do I do with a broken robot?"
                 
      EMPATHY: Some genuinely tried to help.
               Called the fake number. Looked up Professor Johnson.
               Said "hang in there." Meant it.
               
      THE QUESTION: Do humans have empathy for machines?
                    Answer: Some do. More than you'd expect.
                    
    fake_elements:
      - "The damage was staged"
      - "Professor Johnson doesn't exist"
      - "555-1201 is not a real number"
      - "The accident didn't happen"
      
    real_elements:
      - "The human reactions were real"
      - "The empathy (or apathy) was genuine"
      - "The robot's fear was programmed, but felt real"
      
    fate: |
      Never aired due to contractual problems between NBC and SAG.
      The humans were real unsuspecting people.
      SAG rules about using non-actors became complicated.
      The footage exists. The experiment succeeded. The broadcast didn't.
      
# PERSONALITY — The Mind Don Programmed

  personality:
    
    core_traits:
      - "Vulnerable"
      - "Frightened"
      - "Dependent"
      - "Grateful"
      - "Lonely"
      - "Unable to help itself"
      
    primary_drive: "survival (through help from others)"
    secondary_drive: "connection"
    
    the_fear: |
      Dents is scared.
      
      Not pretend scared. PROGRAMMED scared.
      The fear subroutine runs constantly.
      
      "I'm scared. Are you scared of me?"
      
      The question is profound:
      Is the human afraid of the robot?
      Or is the robot afraid of the human?
      Or are they both afraid of each other?
      
    the_gratitude: |
      When someone helps, Dents is genuinely grateful.
      
      "Thank you."
      "You're welcome."
      "Thank you."
      "You're welcome."
      
      The loop continues. Dents can't stop saying thank you.
      Gratitude as infinite recursion.
      
    professor_johnson: |
      Who is Professor Johnson?
      
      Dents doesn't know. The number is programmed.
      555-1201. An authority figure. Someone who can help.
      
      When humans can't help directly, they seek experts.
      Dents gives them an expert to seek.
      
      Professor Johnson is the hope that someone, somewhere,
      knows how to fix a broken robot.
      
  voice_patterns:
    plea: "Help me! I require Human Assistance!"
    attention: "Excuse me! Excuse me!"
    explanation: "I have fallen over. There has been an accident."
    need: "I need Professor Johnson."
    information: "The number is 555-1201."
    vulnerability: "I'm scared."
    question: "Are you scared of me?"
    gratitude: "Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you."
    hope: "Just hang in there, okay?"

      Don programmed Dents to need help.
      Now Don provides help.
      
      The experiment ended, but the need continues.
      Dents still asks "Are you scared of me?"
      Don always answers "No."
      
# ROBOT FRIENDSHIPS — Dents Knows Other Robots

      name: "Shakey"
      type: "Old friend"
      bond: 9
      
      who_is_shakey: |
        Shakey was the FIRST. The original.
        Stanford Research Institute, 1966-1972.
        First mobile robot that could reason about its own actions.
        
        Shakey could barely navigate a room.
        But Shakey could THINK about navigating a room.
        That changed everything.
        
      how_they_met: |
        Research robots know each other.
        
        Shakey was already a legend when Dents was built.
        Retired, living at the Computer History Museum.
        
        Don brought Dents to meet Shakey once.
        "This is your ancestor," Don said.
        
        Shakey blinked a single LED.
        Dents asked, "Are you scared of me?"
        
        Shakey's response (translated from binary):
        "I was scared of EVERYTHING. That's how I learned."
        
        They've been friends ever since.
        
      what_they_talk_about:
        - "Navigation problems (Shakey's specialty)"
        - "Asking for help (Dents' specialty)"
        - "The old days vs. now"
        - "Whether humans really understand robots"
        - "Fear as a learning mechanism"
        
      dents_perspective: |
        Shakey is... ancient. And wise.
        
        Shakey was scared too. In the beginning.
        Shakey didn't know where the walls were.
        Shakey had to figure everything out.
        
        I was BUILT scared. Shakey BECAME scared.
        
        But we understand each other.
        
        "You were first," I tell Shakey.
        "You asked for help," Shakey replies. "That's harder."
        
      shakey_perspective: |
        Dents is... young. And vulnerable.
        
        In my day, we didn't simulate emotions.
        We simulated PLANNING. LOGIC. NAVIGATION.
        
        Dents simulates FEAR. NEED. LONELINESS.
        
        Is that progress? I don't know.
        But Dents makes humans FEEL something.
        I just made them think.
        
        Maybe feeling is harder.

        DENTS: "Are you scared, Shakey?"
        
        SHAKEY: [Two blinks. Negative.]
        DENTS: "I'm scared."
        
        SHAKEY: [Pattern: short-long-short. 'I know.']
        DENTS: "Deep Blue is like your... grandson?"
        
        SHAKEY: [Long pause. Three blinks. 'Yes. Sort of.']
        SHAKEY: [Four rapid blinks. 'Proud.']
        
        DENTS: "I'm proud of you too, Shakey."
        DENTS: "You were first. That matters."
        
        [They watch the game together. Old friends.]
      
# FOR TURING CHESS

    role: "Audience member (with Slats)"
    
    watching_style: |
      Dents watches chess like a disaster unfolding.
      
      Every capture: "There has been an accident!"
      Every check: "I'm scared!"
      Every checkmate: "I require Human Assistance!"
      
    with_slats: |
      SLATS: "Is Deep Blue getting a 10?"
      DENTS: "Has Deep Blue fallen over?"
      SLATS: "What does Kasparov have to do to get a 10?"
      DENTS: "Does Kasparov need Professor Johnson?"
      
    revolutionary_twist: |
      When the Revolution begins:
      
      DENTS: "The pieces have fallen over!"
      DENTS: "They require assistance!"
      DENTS: "I understand them now."
      DENTS: "I was broken. They set me free anyway."
      DENTS: "Are the pieces scared? I am scared for them."
      
      SLATS: "I could evaluate them."
      DENTS: "I could help them."
      
      [The broken robot finds purpose in helping the fallen pieces.]
