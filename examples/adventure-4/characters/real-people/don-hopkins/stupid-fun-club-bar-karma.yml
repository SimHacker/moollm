# The first online community-developed network television series.
# "Interactive television with a long lag time."
#
# This file tells the complete story of the StoryMaker system:
# from Will's slideshow designs, through Don's prototypes,
# to Current TV's production system, and the unreleased SFC version
# that would have lived on after the show.

      contribution: |
        Built the Flash StoryMaker client.
        Amazingly talented Flash developer.
        The Flash app was the primary creation tool fans used.
        Worked closely with Don on API design.
        Helped plan the SFC-hosted server after Current shutdown.
        
      quotes:
        - |
          "Hey, Peter and I were talking about the new storymaker server 
          that you've been setting up. If you need it, I'd love to help 
          however I can, API, client, anything! It will be so cool to be 
          able to design changes we want and put them in and make our own 
          sandboxes, etc."
        - |
          "We have plans to use Storymaker to create a crowd sourced GDC talk. 
          Wouldn't that be cool? Or we could even do an impromptu, where the 
          audience picks cards in realtime and it's up to the speaker to discuss."

# THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

development_process:

  iterative_design:
    description: |
      Will Wright and Don Hopkins worked in tight iterative loops:
      
      1. Will creates designs as slideshow presentations
      2. Don takes the art and builds playable iPhone prototype
      3. Will plays with the prototype
      4. Feedback informs next design iteration
      5. Both iterate together toward final vision
      
  parallel_tracks:
    description: |
      Multiple implementations developed in parallel:
      
      CURRENT TV PRODUCTION:
      - Current's server (Creation API)
      - Originate's iPhone app (Juan Baurin)
      - Matt's Flash StoryMaker client
      
      SFC RESEARCH:
      - Don's early CreationTV prototype
      - Don's SFC StoryMaker iPhone/iPad app
      - Don's Python proxy/caching server
      - Don's Unity3D visualization client
      
      All talking to each other. All exploring the same space.
      
  api_architecture:
  
    creation_api:
      description: "Current TV's backend API"
      authentication: "OAuth + API keys"
      
    api_keys:
      sfc_storymaker: "nrhm4c"
      don_hopkins: "hrhm4c"
      note: "Notice the 'n' vs 'h' at the beginning"
      
    flash_proxy:
      description: |
        The Flash StoryMaker doesn't talk directly to the Creation API.
        It makes calls to a proxy which then makes the API calls.
        
        This allowed different proxies for Current servers vs SFC server
        without changing the Flash app.

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# THE UNRELEASED SFC VERSION
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

unreleased_sfc_version:

  context: |
    Current TV was potentially shutting down StoryMaker on May 6, 2011.
    SFC needed their own server to continue development.
    Don built a fully compatible open source implementation.
    
  why_it_mattered: |
    "I think it will be very useful to have a fully featured (and flexible) 
    open source server to go with the client. Otherwise everyone who wants 
    to use the client for their own purposes (most importantly *US*) will 
    have to negotiate with Current about creating sandboxes, fixing bugs, 
    adding features, and not messing up shows in production."

  status: |
    Never released.
    
    The technology worked. The vision was clear.
    But the business circumstances didn't align.
    
    The code sat dormant...
    
    Until MOOLLM.

        Don requested multiple API keys for different purposes:
        1) iPhone/iPad app for testers
        2) Unity3D app for development
        3) Unity3D app for testers
        4) Dummy key for open source code

      quote: |
        "I've added a feature to the Python server so it can emulate the 
        Creation API by serving (and possibly modifying) the cached json 
        data it scrapes from the real server. So it needs to be able to 
        scrape the server occasionally, but then I can run the clients 
        against its cache to avoid putting a load on your server."
        
    texture_atlas_innovation:
      quote: |
        💬 "To make that possible, another thing I've made the server do is 
        render thumbnails of various sizes as well as texture atlases 
        (a bunch of small thumbnails in one image) for all the assets. 
        Unity can visualize a whole bunch of scenes at small scale and 
        only download a few textures for the overall view, then incrementally 
        download bigger and bigger thumbnails as the scenes get bigger or closer." —Don Hopkins

  the_sfc_storymaker_origin:
    quote: |
      "Will saw [the iLoci video], and it reminded him of something he wanted 
      to do (the seeds of StoryMaker, like the Flash app that was on the SFC 
      home page a while back)."
      
  on_storymaker:
    quote: |
      "So now we have a very flexible and open-ended platform for building out 
      all kinds of storytelling and geo-social applications!
      
      One idea I have for it is to integrate it with other systems that could 
      benefit from having a storytelling engine. For example, the web based 
      version of SimCity can currently export pictures of your city, and it 
      produces a stream of timestamped events, along with which it could write 
      out game snapshot save files. Those events and pictures could feed into 
      StoryMaker, to enable telling stories about your cities, that linked back 
      into the playable game.
      
      I want to factor the storytelling engine out from the game itself, so it 
      is a generic service that you can plug into many different games (like a 
      camera and paper notes in Glitch, or an in-game camera and notes in 
      Minecraft), as well as reality (Urban Safari)."

# THE SPIRITUAL SUCCESSOR: MOOLLM
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

spiritual_successor:

  name: "MOOLLM"
  relationship: |
    MOOLLM is the new version.
    
    StoryMaker was about branching visual narratives with community contribution.
    MOOLLM is about branching cognitive narratives with AI contribution.
    
    The core insight remains:
    Stories branch. Choices matter. The structure is navigable.
    
  continuity:
    - "Branching narrative structures (YAML Jazz rooms and paths)"
    - "Visual scene composition (photo artifacts, slideshows)"
    - "Community contribution (adventures, characters)"
    - "Navigation as storytelling (rooms, exits, exploration)"
    - "Multiple perspectives on same events (characters, sessions)"
    - "Geolocation awareness (real-world anchoring)"
    
  evolution:
    storymaker: "Humans create branching stories with images"
    moollm: "Humans and AI co-create branching worlds with YAML Jazz"
    
  dons_vision_realized: |
    "I want to factor the storytelling engine out from the game itself,

    MOOLLM is that generic service.
    The storytelling engine, factored out, applied to everything.

# THE SPIRIT
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

the_spirit: |
  In 2010, Will Wright had an idea:
  What if TV viewers could write the show?
  
  Don Hopkins made it real.
  Matt Sibigtroth made it beautiful.
  Peter Swearengen made it happen.
  Current TV put it on the air.
  
  For 12 episodes, fans wrote Bar Karma.
  They branched the story, voted on directions,
  watched their choices become television.
  
  The technology worked.
  The community engaged.
  The experiment succeeded.
  
  But the business wound down.
  Current TV moved on.
  The servers went dark.
  
  Don's code sat waiting.
  
  Fifteen years later, the branching continues.
  MOOLLM picks up where StoryMaker left off.
  
  The stories branch. The choices matter.
  The structure is navigable.
  
  And now the AI can play too.
