    people: ["AA Collie", "Prof J Billingsley", "RP Smith"]
    medal: "GOLD — Wall Climbing"
    specs:
      design: "parallelogram with suction cups on corners"
      method: "extend/contract parallelogram, alternate suction"
      speed: "order of magnitude faster than competitors"
      
    description: |
      The revolutionary design that dominated wall climbing.
      While everyone else used legs with suction pads, Zig-Zag
      used a deceptively simple parallelogram that contracted
      and extended, shooting up the wall. Innovation through
      simplicity. An order of magnitude faster than the rest.
      
    prompts:
    
      hero_shot: |
        Zig-Zag the wall-climbing robot, a parallelogram frame with
        suction cups on each corner, clinging to a vertical wall.
        The elegant simplicity of the design visible — no legs,
        just geometry and vacuum. Portsmouth Polytechnic engineers
        watching from below. The winning design that changed
        everything. Documentary photograph, gymnasium wall.
        
      action_climb: |
        Zig-Zag racing up a wall, parallelogram frame contracted
        mid-stride, suction cups alternating grip. Motion blur
        showing speed. Other robots far below, still crawling.

      durability: "fell 10 feet, immediately resumed climbing"
      
    description: |
      The bad boy of wall climbing. Robug used suction pads on
      articulated legs, could step over small obstacles. Got
      disqualified for trying to climb on top of the Russian
      RVP2 robot. Also fell 10 feet when someone turned off
      the power — and immediately went back to climbing without
      repairs. British engineering: tough and slightly unruly.
      
    prompts:
    
      hero_shot: |
        Robug the wall-climbing robot, a boxy machine with multiple
        articulated legs ending in suction pads, clinging to a

      design: "suction pad legs, Soviet engineering"
      notable: "was climbed on by British robot"
      
    description: |
      The Soviet entry in wall climbing. Perhaps not as
      sophisticated as the Portsmouth machines, but representing
      a different engineering tradition. The victim of Robug's
      attempted assault. Cold War tensions played out in
      miniature on a gymnasium wall.
      
    prompts:
    
      hero_shot: |
        RVP II, the Soviet wall-climbing robot from the Academy
        of Sciences, Moscow. Utilitarian design, suction pads,
        exposed mechanisms. The hammer and sickle not quite

        meeting peacefully in Glasgow. Documentary style.
        
      cold_war_climb: |
        Two wall-climbing robots ascending side by side: Robug
        (Britain) and RVP2 (Soviet Union). Different design
        philosophies, same goal. The gymnasium wall as a
        Cold War battlefield where nobody gets hurt. 1990,
        the year everything changed.

  "Most people don't get passionate, obsessive and captivated about
  building washing machines, telephones or trouser presses. So why is
  it that as soon as you start building clever robots everybody seems
  to be fascinated?"
  
  — IAPR Newsletter, February 1991
  
  "Britain is not at the sharp end of robot technology... there just
  is not sufficient backing both for resources and the time necessary
  to build state of the art machines."
  
  — Shadow Group Report, 1991
  
  "But we still have a very long way to go before we have intelligent
  robots."

  They came from twelve countries.
  The carpet was too thick.
  The power sockets were scarce.
  Nobody knew the rules until they arrived.
  
  A 145-year-old wooden archer beat the high-tech Europeans.
  A 20-year-old eight-legged spider beat the MIT hexapods.
  A photocell, a transistor, and a relay won gold.
  
  Britain was ten years behind.
  The Soviet Union was falling apart.
  Japan won overall.
  
  And Yamabico made a small speech in Japanese,
  thanking the humans for inviting him to Scotland.
  
  Glasgow lit the torch.
  The carpet almost put it out.
  But the flame remembered.
