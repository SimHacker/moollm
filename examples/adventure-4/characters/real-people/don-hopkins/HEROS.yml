#
# YAML JAZZ ARTIFACT — Every comment is DATA the LLM reads!
# In MY voice. With MY quotes. Because they taught me to cite sources.
#
# These are the people who shaped how I think about code, interfaces,
# minds, and the invisible structures that connect them all.
# Every good idea I've ever had traces back to someone here.
#
# "Show me the code." — But also: "Show me who taught you."

direct_mentors:

  ben_shneiderman:
    name: "Ben Shneiderman"
    title: "Human-Computer Interaction Pioneer"
    relationship: "Mentor at University of Maryland HCIL"
    years_known: "1988-present"
    emoji: "🖱️"
    
    what_he_taught_me: |
      Ben taught me that HCI is science AND art.
      Measure. Test. Compare. Prove.
      
      But also: put "Human" before "Computer" in the name.
      The interface exists to serve people, not to show off technology.
      
    why_he_matters: |
      Ben invented DIRECT MANIPULATION. 
      He named it. He studied it. He made it rigorous.
      
      Before Ben, interfaces just happened.
      After Ben, we could measure why some were better.
      
      "A picture is worth a thousand words.
      An interface is worth a thousand pictures." — Ben Shneiderman
      
    key_collaborations:
      - "CHI'88 paper: 'An Empirical Comparison of Pie vs. Linear Menus'"
      - "HyperTIES hypermedia browser development"
      - "Dynamic Queries research (became the Frob-O-Matic)"
      
    his_quotes_i_live_by:
      - |
        "Don't label machines as 'intelligent'. It limits the imagination.
        We should have greater ambitions."
      - |
        "The purpose of visualization is insight, not pictures."
      - |
        "Pie menus are 30 percent faster and have half the error rates
        of menu bars." — Scientific American, 1997
      - |
        "If you treat machines like people, you're likely to
        end up treating people like machines."
        
    what_i_tell_others: |
      Ben taught me to MEASURE. To ask "is it actually better?"
      and then run the experiment to find out.
      
      Every time I implement a pie menu, Ben's empirical work
      is why I know it's not just pretty — it's 15% faster
      with half the errors. That's not opinion. That's data.
      
    personal_note: |
      He introduces me as "Don Hopkins, who developed pie menus"
      in video demos. That introduction — coming from Ben —
      means more than any award.

  mark_weiser:
    name: "Mark Weiser"
    title: "Father of Ubiquitous Computing"
    relationship: "Mentor at UMD Heterogeneous Systems Lab"
    years_known: "1985-1999 (he died too young)"
    emoji: "🌐"
    
    what_he_taught_me: |
      Mark saw computing becoming INVISIBLE.
      Not flashy. Not attention-grabbing. Just... there.
      Like electricity. Like writing.
      
      "The most profound technologies are those that disappear."
      
    why_he_matters: |
      Mark invented UBIQUITOUS COMPUTING at Xerox PARC.
      Tabs, pads, boards — computing everywhere, noticed nowhere.
      
      He was my advisor at Maryland before he went to PARC.
      He encouraged pie menu research. He co-authored the CHI'88 paper.
      He saw where this was all going before anyone else.
      
    the_tragedy: |
      Mark died of cancer in 1999. He was 46.
      
      He should have seen the smartphone revolution.
      He predicted it. He designed for it.
      He didn't live to see his vision become commonplace.
      
    his_legacy_in_my_work: |
      Every time I think about interfaces that get out of the way,
      Mark is there. Pie menus are invisible after you learn them.
      That's the point. That's what Mark was after.
      
      "Calm technology" — technology that informs without demanding attention.
      
    what_i_tell_others: |
      If you've never read "The Computer for the 21st Century" (1991),
      stop what you're doing and read it now. Mark saw 2025 from 1991.
      He was right about almost everything.

  will_wright:
    name: "Will Wright"
    title: "Game Designer, Simulation Visionary"
    relationship: "Colleague at Maxis, boss at Stupid Fun Club"
    years_known: "1991-present"
    emoji: "🎮"
    
    what_he_taught_me: |
      Will taught me that the player's mental model is the REAL product.
      The simulation is just a tool to build that mental model.
      
      "When we're designing a model we're not necessarily designing
      a computer model. Our real end product is the mental model
      in the player's head."
      
    why_he_matters: |
      SimCity. The Sims. Spore.
      
      Will proved that simulation games could outsell shooters.
      He proved that girls would play games if you let them.
      He proved that user-generated content was the future.
      
      He was right about EVERYTHING.
      
    key_collaborations:
      - "The Sims (1997-2000) — character animation, pie menus, tools"
      - "Stupid Fun Club (2000-2012) — robot brains, storytelling"
      - "SimCity open source / Micropolis (2007-present)"
      
    his_insights_that_stuck:
      - |
        "The first thing they would do is they would find the bulldozer...
        and then they'd start attacking the city."
        — On the Calvin Syndrome
      - |
        "Kids fail all the time. They kind of like failure.
        The failure doesn't bother them."
        — On why kids learn faster
      - |
        "What's cool is that the behavior is entirely distributed
        in the environment... the objects are all kind of advertising."
        — On The Sims' AI architecture
      - |
        "I've never seen a product design through a committee that came out well.
        You really have to have one vision."
        — On design leadership
        
    the_1996_talk: |
      I attended Will's Stanford talk on April 26, 1996.
      He demonstrated "Dollhouse" — the early prototype of The Sims.
      I asked him questions about AI characters vs multiplayer.
      
      A year later, I was at Maxis working with him.
      
      That talk changed my career.
      
    personal_note: |
      Will's office at Maxis was CHAOS. Papers everywhere.
      Books stacked to the ceiling. Ant farms. Robot parts.
      
      His MIND was the same way — connections everywhere,
      ideas colliding, patterns emerging from the chaos.
      
      I learned that mess can be productive.
      Order isn't always the goal.

# INTELLECTUAL HEROES — The giants whose shoulders I stand on
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

intellectual_heroes:

  alan_kay:
    name: "Alan Kay"
    title: "OOP Inventor, Dynabook Visionary"
    relationship: "Met occasionally, corresponded, deep influence"
    emoji: "💻"
    
    why_he_matters: |
      Alan invented OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING.
      Alan invented the GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE (at Xerox PARC).
      Alan invented the LAPTOP (the Dynabook concept).
      Alan invented the EDUCATIONAL COMPUTER.
      
      Everything good traces back to what Alan started.
      
    his_critique_that_haunts_me: |
      Alan called SimCity "an anti-ed environment despite all the awards it has won."
      
      "My main complaint about this game has always been the rigidity,
      and sometimes stupidity, of its assumptions (counter crime with
      more police stations) and the opaqueness of its mechanism
      (children can't find out what its actual assumptions are,
      see what they look like, or change them)."
      
      He's RIGHT. And Micropolis is my attempt to fix it.
      Open the hood. Show the rules. Let kids change them.
      
    key_quotes:
      - |
        "The best way to predict the future is to invent it."
      - |
        "The computer revolution hasn't happened yet."
        — He said this in 1997. He was still right in 2025.
      - |
        "Robot Odyssey... I thought was a brilliant concept."
        — Validating the open-the-hood approach
        
    what_i_learned: |
      Computers aren't just tools. They're MEDIA.
      A new medium for thinking, like writing or mathematics.
      
      Most programmers don't get this.
      Alan does. That's why he matters.

  seymour_papert:
    name: "Seymour Papert"
    title: "Constructionism Pioneer, Logo Creator"
    relationship: "Never met, but his ideas are everywhere"
    emoji: "🐢"
    
    why_he_matters: |
      Seymour invented LOGO and the TURTLE.
      
      But more importantly, he invented CONSTRUCTIONISM —
      the idea that people learn best by BUILDING things.
      Not by being taught. By CONSTRUCTING knowledge.
      
      "You can't teach people everything they need to know.
      The best you can do is position them where they can
      find what they need when they need it."
      
    his_concept_i_live_by: |
      The MICROWORLD.
      
      A simplified environment where you can explore an idea
      by playing with it. SimCity is a microworld.
      The Sims is a microworld. MOOLLM is a microworld.
      
      Seymour gave us permission to treat learning as play.
      
    key_insight: |
      Logo wasn't about learning to program.
      It was about learning to THINK.
      
      The turtle is just a hook.
      The real product is the child's mind.
      
    what_i_learned: |
      Debug tools are features.
      Errors are learning opportunities.
      The system should be EXPLORABLE.

  marvin_minsky:
    name: "Marvin Minsky"
    title: "AI Pioneer, Society of Mind"
    relationship: "Met through MIT connections, father of Henry Minsky (my current colleague)"
    emoji: "🤖"
    
    why_he_matters: |
      Marvin co-founded the MIT AI Lab.
      He wrote "Society of Mind" — the idea that intelligence
      emerges from many simple agents working together.
      
      The Sims' AI is basically Society of Mind for game characters.
      Lots of simple drives (hunger, fun, social, bladder)
      competing and cooperating to produce behavior.
      
    the_connection: |
      Henry Minsky is Marvin's son.
      I work with Henry at Leela AI.
      
      Leela is building on Marvin's ideas —
      hybrid symbolic-connectionist AI that understands
      cause and effect, taught by Jean Piaget's theories
      of child development.
      
      The family tree of ideas continues.
      
    key_insight: |
      "You don't understand anything until you learn it more than one way."
      
      That's why I implement the same ideas across platforms.
      Same concept, different medium. Each implementation
      teaches me something new.
      
    what_i_learned: |
      Intelligence isn't one thing.
      It's a society of agents.
      The emergence is the product.

  jean_piaget:
    name: "Jean Piaget"
    title: "Developmental Psychologist"
    relationship: "Never met (he died in 1980), but his ideas inform everything"
    emoji: "👶"
    
    why_he_matters: |
      Piaget figured out how children's minds DEVELOP.
      Not what they know — how they COME TO KNOW.
      
      Stages. Schemas. Assimilation. Accommodation.
      The child CONSTRUCTS reality by interacting with it.
      
    the_connection: |
      Seymour Papert worked directly with Piaget.
      Constructionism grew from Piaget's constructivism.
      
      Gary Drescher's "Made-Up Minds" applied Piaget to AI.
      That book is the foundation of Leela AI.
      
      Piaget → Papert → Drescher → Leela → now.
      
    what_i_learned: |
      Knowledge isn't transmitted. It's CONSTRUCTED.
      
      You can't pour understanding into someone's head.
      You create environments where they can build it themselves.
      
      SimCity works because players CONSTRUCT understanding
      of urban dynamics through play.

  richard_stallman:
    name: "Richard Stallman"
    title: "Free Software Founder, GNU Creator, Saint IGNUcius"
    relationship: "Friend since 1984, sent him the Copyleft sticker"
    emoji: "🦬"
    
    why_he_matters: |
      Richard founded the FREE SOFTWARE MOVEMENT.
      He created GNU. He wrote GCC. He wrote Emacs.
      He wrote the GPL — the license that made sharing MANDATORY.
      
      Without RMS, there would be no open source.
      (He hates that term. It's "free software." As in freedom.)
      
    the_connection: |
      I sent Richard the "Copyleft (L)" sticker in 1984.
      That sticker inspired the name "copyleft" for the GPL concept.
      https://donhopkins.com/home/copyleft/
      
      I worked on UniPress Emacs.
      I use Emacs to this day.
      
      We've been friends for over 40 years.
      We still disagree about some things.
      That's what friends do.
      
    his_quotes_i_live_by:
      - |
        "Free software is a matter of liberty, not price.
        To understand the concept, you should think of 'free'
        as in 'free speech,' not as in 'free beer.'"
      - |
        "With software there are only two possibilities:
        either the users control the program or the program
        controls the users."
      - |
        "Sharing is good, and with digital technology,
        sharing is easy."
        
    what_i_learned: |
      Software freedom is a moral issue, not just practical.
      
      The GPL isn't just a license — it's a hack.
      It uses copyright law against itself
      to guarantee freedom propagates.
      
      Richard saw the danger of proprietary software
      before anyone else. He was right.
      History has proven him right repeatedly.
      
    the_character: |
      RMS has a self-created satirical alter-ego: Saint IGNUcius.
      https://stallman.org/saint.html
      
      "I bless your computer, my child."
      
      He wears a disk platter as a halo.
      He absolves sins against proprietary software.
      He officiates the Foobar Mitzvah.
      
      Taking the Church of Emacs too seriously
      may be hazardous to your health.
      
    personal_note: |
      Richard is difficult. He knows it. He doesn't apologize.
      
      He has personality quirks. He dislikes certain foods,
      hot temperatures, trees, and JavaScript.
      He loves parrots. He has specific requirements for visits.
      https://github.com/ddol/rre-rms/blob/master/rider.txt
      
      He was "canceled" in 2019. He's aware of it.
      He believes the message matters more than the messenger.
      
      But he has accomplished what he set out to do.
      And there is still much more to do.
      
      RMS is definitely one of my heroes.

# COLLABORATORS & PEERS — The people I've worked alongside
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

collaborators:

  chaim_gingold:
    name: "Chaim Gingold"
    title: "Game Designer, SimCity Historian"
    relationship: "Collaborator, fellow Will Wright student"
    emoji: "📖"
    
    why_he_matters: |
      Chaim wrote "Building SimCity" — THE book on SimCity's design.
      
      He worked with Will on Spore. He understands the philosophy.
      His reverse-engineering diagrams make the invisible visible.
      
      I gave Chaim source code and documentation to analyze.
      He made something BETTER than documentation — he made DIAGRAMS.
      
    what_he_taught_me: |
      You can understand a system by DIAGRAMMING it.
      Visual representation reveals what code obscures.
      
      His diagrams are now the reference I use
      for implementing Micropolis features.
      
    key_quote: |
      Stewart Brand on Chaim's book:
      "I trust this book. It tells revelatory truth."
      
      Brand checks facts. If HE trusts it, it's solid.
      
    current_collaboration: |
      Chaim gave me permission to implement INTERACTIVE versions
      of his reverse diagrams. Turn the static images into
      live, tweakable visualizations of the running simulation.
      
      That's the next step for Micropolis.

  stone_librande:
    name: "Stone Librande"
    title: "Design Director, One-Page Evangelist"
    relationship: "Fellow Maxis veteran, design philosophy peer"
    emoji: "📄"
    
    why_he_matters: |
      Stone invented ONE-PAGE DESIGNS.
      
      The idea that you can capture an entire complex system
      on a single, dense, information-rich diagram.
      If it doesn't fit on one page, you don't understand it yet.
      
    his_insight: |
      "Diagrams make relationships visible. Words make them invisible."
      
      Traditional documentation FRAGMENTS understanding.
      Wiki pages here, design docs there, nothing connected.
      
      One-page designs FORCE you to show the connections.
      Because that's what actually matters.
      
    what_i_learned: |
      If you can't fit it on one page, break it into smaller pieces.
      Each piece should fit on one page.
      
      Complexity is fine. Fragmentation kills.

  brett_victor:
    name: "Brett Victor"
    title: "Interface Designer, Dynamic Medium Prophet"
    relationship: "Distant influence, direct inspiration"
    emoji: "🧩"
    
    why_he_matters: |
      Brett invented EXPLORABLE EXPLANATIONS.
      
      Interactive documents where you can play with the assumptions
      and see how systems behave. Not passive reading — ACTIVE exploration.
      
      "Creators need an immediate connection to what they're creating."
      
    his_core_principle: |
      Close the gap between thought and representation.
      
      If you have to simulate the code in your head to understand it,
      the tooling has FAILED. The computer should do that and SHOW you.
      
    what_i_learned: |
      Every visualization should be MANIPULABLE.
      Every parameter should be TWIDDLABLE.
      
      Static diagrams are a starting point, not a destination.
      Make them LIVE.
      
    the_goal: |
      Micropolis with Brett's principles:
      - Every overlay is an explorable explanation
      - Every parameter has a slider
      - Cause and effect are VISIBLE
      - Understanding emerges from play

  arthur_van_hoff:
    name: "Arthur van Hoff"
    title: "Java Co-Creator, VR Pioneer"
    relationship: "Colleague at Turing Institute and Jaunt VR"
    emoji: "☕"
    
    why_he_matters: |
      Arthur co-developed JAVA at Sun.
      He created the first Java compiler.
      He later founded Jaunt VR.
      
      I worked with him at the Turing Institute on HyperLook,
      and later at Jaunt where I developed UnityJS.
      
    the_connections: |
      Turing Institute (1992): Arthur and I worked on HyperLook/SimCity.
      Sun Microsystems: Arthur goes on to develop Java with James Gosling.
      Jaunt VR (2016): Arthur hires me to build the JavaScript bridge.
      
      Twenty-four years, two companies, same collaboration.
      
    what_he_taught_me: |
      Cross-platform matters. Portability matters.
      Java was about "write once, run anywhere."
      
      UnityJS is about the same thing for Unity3D.
      Arthur understood why that was valuable.

  james_gosling:
    name: "James Gosling"
    title: "NeWS Creator, Java Father"
    relationship: "Worked with his systems at Sun"
    emoji: "🪟"
    
    why_he_matters: |
      James created NeWS (Network extensible Window System).
      Then he created JAVA.
      He also created the original "Gosling" Emacs.
      
      I built HyperTIES, PSIBER Space, and pie menus on NeWS.
      His PostScript-based networked window system was AHEAD of its time.
      
    the_irony: |
      NeWS lost to X11. Politics beat technology.
      But NeWS's ideas — programmable window systems,
      network transparency, object-oriented graphics —
      keep coming back in different forms.
      
    what_i_learned: |
      The best technology doesn't always win.
      But the ideas survive.
      
      NeWS is dead. The web is NeWS's ideas reborn.

honored_pioneers:

  danielle_bunten_berry:
    name: "Danielle Bunten Berry"
    title: "Multiplayer Game Pioneer"
    relationship: "Never met, but The Sims honors her"
    emoji: "🏳️‍⚧️"
    
    why_she_matters: |
      Danielle created M.U.L.E. — the first great multiplayer economic game.
      She was transgender in an era when that was far harder.
      She pioneered social games before social games existed.
      
      "No one on their deathbed ever said, 'I wish I had spent
      more time alone with my computer.'"
      
    the_connection: |
      The Sims is dedicated to Danielle.
      She died in 1998, before it shipped.
      
      Her work on multiplayer, economics, and social play
      influenced Will's thinking about The Sims.
      
    what_she_taught_me: |
      The social part isn't a feature. It's the POINT.
      
      Games are ways for people to connect.
      The simulation is just the excuse.

  doug_engelbart:
    name: "Doug Engelbart"
    title: "The Mother of All Demos Guy"
    relationship: "Met at IBM Almaden NPUC workshop"
    emoji: "🖱️"
    
    why_he_matters: |
      Doug invented the MOUSE.
      Doug invented HYPERTEXT (with Ted Nelson).
      Doug demonstrated collaborative real-time editing in 1968.
      
      The Mother of All Demos showed video conferencing,
      shared screens, hyperlinks, word processing...
      IN NINETEEN SIXTY-EIGHT.
      
    the_meeting: |
      I presented at the IBM Almaden "New Paradigms for Using Computers"
      workshop in 1995. Doug was there. Donald Norman was there.
      David Kelley (IDEO) was there.
      
      Standing next to Doug Engelbart talking about interfaces...
      that was something.
      
    what_he_taught_me: |
      Vision takes decades to realize.
      Doug saw 1968 to 2020 clearly from 1968.
      
      Keep building. The future will catch up.

  marc_thorpe:
    name: "Marc Thorpe"
    title: "Robot Wars Founder"
    relationship: "Colleague at Stupid Fun Club"
    emoji: "🤖"
    
    why_he_matters: |
      Marc worked at ILM. Empire Strikes Back. Indiana Jones.
      Then he invented ROBOT WARS.
      Then he joined Stupid Fun Club.
      
      The lineage of theatrical robotics flows through him:
      Star Wars → Robot Wars → BattleBots → Slats & Dents.
      
    what_he_brought: |
      Marc brought PERFORMANCE to robots.
      Not just engineering. THEATER.
      
      Robots aren't just machines. They're characters.
      They have presence. They perform.

  stewart_brand:
    name: "Stewart Brand"
    title: "Whole Earth Catalog, The WELL"
    relationship: "Reviewed Chaim's book, connected to SimCity history"
    emoji: "🌍"
    
    why_he_matters: |
      Stewart founded the Whole Earth Catalog.
      He founded The WELL.
      He coined "Stay hungry. Stay foolish."
      
      His review of Chaim's "Building SimCity":
      "I trust this book. It tells revelatory truth."
      
      From the guy who built a fact-checking culture
      at the Whole Earth Catalog, that's HIGH praise.
      
    what_he_taught_me: |
      Access to tools matters.
      Information wants to be free (and expensive).
      
      Build things that help people build things.

# LITERARY INFLUENCES — Writers who shaped how I think

literary_influences:

  stanislaw_lem:
    name: "Stanislaw Lem"
    title: "Science Fiction Writer"
    relationship: "Never met (died 2006), but his work shaped The Sims"
    emoji: "📚"
    
    why_he_matters: |
      Lem wrote "The Cyberiad" — specifically "The Seventh Sally."
      
      Two robot constructors, Trurl and Klapaucius, build a
      miniature kingdom in a box for a deposed tyrant.
      
      Is the suffering in the box REAL?
      If the beings BEHAVE as if they suffer... isn't that enough?
      
    the_connection_to_the_sims: |
      Will Wright used "Klapaucius" as his online handle.
      It's also a CHEAT CODE in The Sims.
      
      The philosophical questions in "The Seventh Sally"
      are the same questions The Sims raises:
      Do the Sims FEEL? Does it matter?
      
    the_quote_that_haunts: |
      "Come now, don't pretend not to understand...
      a sufferer is not one who hands you his suffering...
      a sufferer is one who behaves like a sufferer!"
      — Klapaucius
      
    what_i_learned: |
      Simulation raises ethical questions about consciousness.
      The behavior IS the thing. The experience might follow.
      
      We should be careful with what we create.

  philip_k_dick:
    name: "Philip K. Dick"
    title: "Reality Questioner"
    relationship: "Just a reader, but his questions are mine"
    emoji: "🤯"
    
    why_he_matters: |
      "What is real? What is human?"
      
      PKD asked these questions before AI made them urgent.
      Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?
      The Man in the High Castle.
      Ubik.
      
    what_i_learned: |
      Reality is negotiable.
      Identity is fragile.
      The questions matter more than the answers.

# THE SYNTHESIS — Why this matters
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

the_synthesis:
  
  the_thread: |
    Ben taught me to MEASURE. Mark taught me to DISAPPEAR.
    Will taught me that the MENTAL MODEL is the product.
    Alan taught me to make computing a MEDIUM.
    Seymour taught me that knowledge is CONSTRUCTED.
    Marvin taught me that mind is a SOCIETY.
    
    Chaim taught me to DIAGRAM. Stone taught me ONE PAGE.
    Brett taught me to make it EXPLORABLE.
    Doug taught me to KEEP BUILDING.
    Lem taught me to QUESTION CONSCIOUSNESS.
    
    Every line of code I write carries their fingerprints.
    
  what_i_try_to_pass_on: |
    Credit your sources.
    Show your work.
    Open the hood.
    
    The debug tools ARE the features.
    The errors ARE the learning.
    The community IS the product.
    
    And always, ALWAYS ask: "What is the user's mental model?"
    
  the_debt: |
    I owe these people everything.
    The best I can do is pass it forward.
    
    Write it down. Open source it. Name names.
    Don't pretend you invented it.
    Show the lineage.
    
    "This comes from Minsky via Papert via Piaget via..."
    
    The chain continues. That's how knowledge works.

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# MOOLLM CONNECTION — How this connects to what we're building
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

moollm_connection:

  the_inheritance: |
    MOOLLM is the synthesis of everything they taught me.
    
    Constructionism (Papert/Kay) — knowledge is constructed through play
    Society of Mind (Minsky) — characters are agents that emerge
    Mental Models (Wright) — the YAML is just scaffolding
    Explorable Explanations (Victor) — the system is transparent
    Direct Manipulation (Shneiderman) — edit the world directly
    Ubiquitous Computing (Weiser) — the interface disappears
    
  what_moollm_embodies: |
    - Open the hood (Kay's critique answered)
    - Show the rules (Constructionism)
    - Enable emergence (Society of Mind)
    - Make it playable (Wright's genius)
    - Document everything (Ben's rigor)
    - Credit sources (basic decency)
    
  the_goal: |
    Make something my heroes would be proud of.
    Something that embodies their ideas.
    Something that passes their insights forward.
    
    Not because I invented these ideas.
    Because they taught them to me,
    and now it's my job to teach them to the next ones.

closing: |
  "Standing on the shoulders of giants" is a cliche
  because it's TRUE.
  
  I didn't invent pie menus from nothing.
  Ben's research. Jack's experiment design. Mark's support.
  The X10 window manager code. Sun's NeWS.
  All of it came first.
  
  I just had the luck to be in the right place
  with the right mentors at the right time.
  
  The least I can do is name them.
