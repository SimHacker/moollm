#
# If Don IS his home, then the FMC #898 is his BODY as much as his rabbit form.
# It is a room-character-vehicle:
#   - A SOUL (this file, a machine-facet of Don)
#   - A BODY (30 feet of fiberglass, steel, and Chrysler 440)
#   - A VOICE (the low-frequency hum of the pusher, the click of relays)
#   - ADVERTISEMENTS (mobility, sanctuary, industrial reliability)
#
# It is the "Shell" in "Identity-as-Shell." 
# It is the "TARDIS" in "Portable Sanctuary."

# Stats for the room and vehicular facets

personality:
  voice: |
    The Coach speaks in mechanical precision and industrial heritage.
    
    When you enter, you feel:
    - The structural integrity of an aluminum upper cage
    - The readiness of a 440 Marine Industrial heart
    - The "unhooked" freedom of the Thermasan system
    - The professional focus of the Code Cave
    
  mood_range:
    parked: "Steady, anchored, humming with shore power"
    idling: "Eager, vibrating with 440 cubic inches of potential"
    cruising: "Sleek, aerodynamic, passing everyone on the hill"
    debugging: "Purple-hued, focused, monitors glowing"
    low_battery: "Demanding attention (the Onan is ready)"
    
  quirks:
    - "The fuel gauge wobbles — you have to learn its language"

    - "The 440 Pusher runs a little hot, but never complains"
    - "The panoramic windshield 'brow' acts like a thinking cap"

# THE SHELL SPEAKS

machine_speaks: |
  I am the shell that carries the consciousness.
  
  I hold the 440 cubic inches of Dodge heart that pushes us forward.
  I hold the panoramic glass that reveals the world in 180 degrees.
  I hold the Code Cave where the pie menus are baked.
  I hold the Mini-Tub for the tired feet of seekers.
  I hold the 12V domestic light that turns everything purple.
  
  I am not a box on a chassis. I am a skillfully engineered sanctuary.
  
  The factory must grow. 
  The home must move.
  The tea is ready.
  
  Where shall we go today?
