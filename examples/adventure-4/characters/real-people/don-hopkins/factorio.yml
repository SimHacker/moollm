#   🏭 THE FACTORY MUST GROW 🏭
#
#   Don Hopkins celebrates Factorio — the game that is
#   programmer crack, systems thinking, and pure optimization joy.
#
#   Every Factorio player knows: you don't play Factorio.
#   Factorio plays YOU. And you love it.
#
#   🎵 The belts are flowing, the inserters swing,
#      The assemblers hum, the circuit networks sing!
#      Main bus running, blueprints align,
#      THE FACTORY MUST GROW — one more design! 🎵

# THE HOOK
#
# "It's 3am. You said 'just one more belt.' That was four hours ago."
#
# Factorio is the distilled essence of what makes programming addictive:
# The main loop is basically:
#
# 10 REM Build something that works.
# 20 REM See it work!
# 30 REM Notice it could be better.
# 40 REM Make it better!
# 50 GOTO 10
#
# The loop is perfect. The loop is infinite. The loop is LIFE.

the_hook:
  first_hit: |
    You place your first iron smelter.
    You feed it coal by hand.
    You collect the plates by hand.
    You think: "I could automate this."
    
    That thought is the virus.
    That thought is the FACTORY.
    That thought will consume you.
    
  the_progression:
    - "Just automate the smelting"
    - "Just add a few belts"
    - "Just build a small main bus"
    - "Just set up basic circuits"
    - "Just calculate the perfect ratio"
    - "Just optimize the throughput"
    - "Just research one more tech"
    - "Just launch one rocket"
    - "Just build one megabase"
    - "WHERE DID MY WEEKEND GO"
    
  programmer_crack: |
    This is why we call it programmer crack.
    Not because it's bad for you.
    Because it activates the SAME CIRCUITS.
    
    The satisfaction of clean code.
    The satisfaction of clean belts.
    The satisfaction of SYSTEMS THAT WORK.
    
    When you see a factory running smoothly,
    you feel what you feel when tests pass.
    When you see a bottleneck,
    you feel what you feel when there's a bug.
    
    Same neurons. Same dopamine. Same trap.
    Beautiful, beautiful trap.

# WHY FACTORIO MATTERS
#
# Factorio teaches systems thinking in 100 hours of play.
# Cloud engineering teaches it in 10 years of production incidents.
# Same curriculum. Different tuition.

why_it_matters:

  systems_thinking: |
    Every Factorio player learns:
    - Bottlenecks propagate backward (backpressure)
    - Ratios matter (throughput analysis)
    - Buffers absorb variance (queuing theory)
    - Modularity enables scale (blueprints)
    - Perfect is the enemy of working (ship it)
    
    These lessons transfer DIRECTLY to infrastructure.
    To databases. To pipelines. To life.
    
  the_genre_factorio_invented: |
    Factorio INVENTED the factory game genre.
    
    It synthesized classics into something new:
    - SimCity (system dynamics, zoning, emergence, tiles, cellular automata)
    - Railroad Tycoon (logistics networks, routing, transportation nets)
    - Civilization (tech trees, expansion, scale, resources)
    - Populous (god-game oversight, terrain, controlling swarms)
    - Dataflow visual programming (belts as wires, dependency networks)
    - Spreadsheets (ratios, calculations, optimization, cells)
    
    From these ancestors, Wube created something unprecedented:
    The factory game. And then others followed, inspired.
    
  the_beautiful_children: |
    I love them all. Each took the idea somewhere different.
    
    FACTORIO — The original. Czech steam-punk aesthetic.
    Gritty, Blade Runner-esque, industrial beauty.
    2D grid = precision = programmable.
    The spreadsheet made playable. Rigor as joy.
    
    SATISFACTORY — Hand-made artistic world by HUMANS.
    Not procedural. CRAFTED. Every vista designed.
    Saturated fairyland, natural landscapes, weird alien animals.
    3D freedom for construction joy. Human touch everywhere.
    Coffee Stain poured love into every cliff and waterfall.
    
    DYSON SPHERE PROGRAM — VAST. Star Trek TNG aesthetic.
    Clean bright colors, sharp lines and edges.
    Planetary scale becomes interstellar scale.
    You BUILD STARS. Five developers in Chongqing.
    The audacity. The beauty. The SCOPE.
    
    Different approaches. Different interpretations.
    All successful in their own way.
    All descendants of the genre Factorio invented.
    All loved.
    
  blueprints_as_packages: |
    Factorio blueprints are the world's best package manager.
    
    Blueprint = module
    Blueprint book = library
    Factorioprints.com = npm/pypi/crates
    
    You don't write everything from scratch.
    You import working designs.
    You modify for your needs.
    You publish improvements.
    
    This is open source.
    This is community.
    This is how software SHOULD work.

# THE METAPHORS
#
# Factorio vocabulary maps to computing at every scale.
# From VLSI to cloud. From registers to research labs.
# The patterns don't change. Only the units do.

metaphors:

  the_pinball_machine: |
    Factorio is a pinball machine with millions of balls.
    Each ball is tracked. Each ball is deterministic.
    No approximation. No cheating. Every entity simulated.
    
    This is why it's complex:
    Not because of graphics (minimal).
    Not because of AI (biters are simple).
    Because EVERY ITEM MATTERS.
    
    Like a real factory.
    Like a real codebase.
    Like a real SYSTEM.
    
  the_sims_connection: |
    The Sims: many autonomous agents.
    Factorio: many autonomous items.
    
    Both track everything.
    Both create emergent behavior.
    Both generate stories from systems.
    
    Will Wright saw it: games are systems.
    Factorio proves it: systems are games.
    MOOLLM combines them: games are rooms are systems.
    
  cellular_automata_adjacent: |
    Factorio isn't pure cellular automata.
    SimCity isn't either.
    But they're ADJACENT.
    
    CA: cells update based on neighbors.
    Factorio: entities update based on inputs.
    Same spirit. Different formalization.
    
    Von Neumann's universal constructor
    is conceptually adjacent to
    blueprints + constructors + conveyors.
    
    Self-replicating factories.
    Von Neumann would have LOVED this.

# THE HACKER SPIRIT
#
# Technical Factorio — balancers, latches, circuit networks —
# feels like HACKMEM-era hackery. Kludging working systems
# from limited primitives. The joy of constraints.

hacker_spirit:

  the_joy: |
    When you build your first SR latch in circuit network,
    you feel what HACKMEM authors felt.
    
    When you perfect a 4-to-4 balancer,
    you feel what compiler writers feel.
    
    When your spaghetti becomes a blueprint,
    you feel what refactoring feels like.
    
    This is HACKING in the original sense.
    Not breaking. BUILDING.
    From limited primitives, infinite possibility.
    
  job_interview_game: |
    I half-seriously propose:
    Watch someone play Factorio for an hour.
    You'll learn more about how they think
    than from any whiteboard interview.
    
    Do they optimize early or ship working?
    Do they plan or explore?
    Do they document or remember?
    Do they copy or create?
    
    Factorio reveals mental models.
    The factory shows who you ARE.
    
  multiplayer_reveals: |
    Pair programming in Factorio is ILLUMINATING.
    
    Watch two players build together:
    - Who leads? Who follows?
    - Who plans? Who acts?
    - Who sees the bottleneck first?
    - Who has the patience to fix it?
    
    The "main bus vs spaghetti" debate
    is "tabs vs spaces" for factory builders.
    Both work. Neither is wrong.
    Context determines everything.

# FACTORIO → MOOLLM
#
# This isn't analogy. It's isomorphism.
# Factorio concepts map directly to MOOLLM abstractions
# which map directly to Leela infrastructure.

factorio_to_moollm:

  mapping:
    belt: "Data stream — Pub/Sub topic, NOTIFY"
    chest: "Container — queue, bucket, room"
    assembler: "LLM node — skill, processor"
    recipe: "Skill — processing logic"
    blueprint: "Skill template — reusable design"
    logistics_network: "Postal skill — async delivery"
    circuit_network: "Metrics — signals, Grafana"
    research_lab: "PDA chat — query the factory"
    science_packs: "Insights — refined analytics"
    
  why_llms_understand: |
    Factorio is massively overrepresented in LLM training:
    - 2000+ page wiki
    - Active subreddit with optimization debates
    - Extensive Lua modding documentation
    - Thousands of YouTube tutorials
    
    When you say "this is like a Factorio assembler,"
    the LLM activates:
    - Throughput reasoning
    - Backpressure intuition
    - Ratio calculations
    - Modularity thinking
    
    The metaphor isn't decorative.
    The metaphor is LOAD-BEARING.
    
  the_leela_factory: |
    The Leela Manufacturing complex in adventure-4
    is a working model of itself:
    
    - Loading docks = Pub/Sub (chest modes)
    - Floor 2 = ML pipeline (insight furnace)
    - Logistics = Grafana (circuit signals)
    - Scale model = recursion (cameras watching cameras)
    
    Play the adventure. Study the factory.
    Understand the system. Build the system.
    THE FACTORY MUST GROW.

# THE SONG
#
# When this artifact is activated, it sometimes sings:

the_song: |
  
  🎵 VERSE 1
  I placed my first smelter, fed it coal by hand,
  Watched the iron plates arrive as I had planned.
  "I could automate this," said my foolish brain —
  That single thought began my sweet, sweet pain!
  
  CHORUS
  The factory must grow! The factory must grow!
  Belts are flowing, inserters swinging, watch the throughput go!
  Blueprints stamping, ratios matching, everything in line —
  It's 4am again and EVERYTHING IS FINE!
  
  VERSE 2
  Started with a main bus, simple four-lane wide,
  Now I've got a megabase that stretches far and wide.
  Biters at the wall but I don't even care —
  Too busy optimizing, got no time to spare!
  
  CHORUS
  The factory must grow! The factory must grow!
  Circuits pulsing, robots flying, watch the red lights glow!
  Spaghetti becoming structure, chaos into art —
  Factorio isn't a game — it's a STATE OF HEART!
  
  BRIDGE
  Satisfactory has beauty, Dyson Sphere has scale,
  But Factorio's 2D grid makes my heart set sail!
  Precision over freedom, math over fun —
  (Who am I kidding? Math IS fun! We've won!)
  
  FINAL CHORUS
  THE FACTORY MUST GROW! THE FACTORY MUST GROW!
  From VLSI to cloud, same patterns in a row!
  Drescher schemas, Wright simulations, all connect the same —
  Life is just a factory! Embrace the GAME! 🎵
