    A spacious gravel lot on the south side of Lane Neverending, nestled
    between Richard's Victorian house and the edge of the square.
    
    THE LOT:
    A professional gravel pad with utility posts humming with AC power.
    Hoses are neatly routed to where the FMC connects. Currently, the
    classic 30-foot FMC 2900R Motor Coach sits perfectly level in the center.
    
    THE SURROUNDINGS:
    To the west, Richard's bookshelves are visible through his windows.
    To the south, behind the lot, a lush garden of carrots and herbs
    gives way to a deep, ancient forest that provides a natural noise
    barrier and infinite thinking space.
    
    A sign on the utility post reads:
    
        "15 LANE NEVERENDING
         CONSCIOUSNESS PROGRAMMING
         MOBILE PIE MENU BAKERY
         (Modal dialogs are violence)"

  examine: |
    THE LOT:
    A well-maintained gravel pad with room for one large RV and a small
    garden. Utility connections on a weathered wooden post. The gravel
    crunches satisfyingly underfoot.
    
    THE FMC #898:
    Parked perfectly level in the center: a classic 30-foot FMC 2900R
    Motor Coach. Sleek, low-profile fiberglass shell in brilliant white
    with crisp blue and white stripes. A tie-dye spiral near the entrance.
    
    THE GARDEN:
    Behind the lot, raised beds full of "debug carrots" and heritage herbs.
    Don tends them between coding sessions.
    
    THE FOREST:
    Beyond the garden, pines and oaks that seem to remember the Origin Tree.
    A path leads south into deeper realizations.
    
    THE VIEW:
    Looking west: Richard's house at 13. Friends.
    Looking north: The Fountain of Infinite Loops.
    Looking south: The forest path.

  atmosphere: |
    The lot feels like a base camp for consciousness exploration.
    The FMC is ready to leave at any moment, but for now, it's home.
    
    Smells of:
    - Pine needles and damp earth from the forest
    - Gravel and dust (nostalgic)
    - Carrot greens from the garden
    
    Sounds of:
    - Birds in the forest out back
    - The occasional hum of the FMC's systems
    - Wind through the pines

      LOT + PORTABLE ROOM PATTERN
      
      The lot is the address. The FMC is a portable room parked here.
      
      If the FMC drives away:
      - The lot remains at 15 Lane Neverending
      - The FMC can be parked elsewhere
      - Don's personal files (selfies, sessions, dreams) stay with the lot
      
      This differs from the original "identity-as-shell" pattern.
      Now: the lot is the anchor, the FMC is the mobile sanctuary.
      
    portable_rooms: |
      Like Richard's study/TARDIS, vehicles are rooms that can move.
      Unlike the TARDIS, the FMC moves through physical space.
      
      When a vehicle is parked:
      - It appears in the lot's vehicles list
      - The lot has an exit to the vehicle
      - The vehicle has an exit back to the lot
      
      When a vehicle moves:
      - Update the vehicle's current_location
      - Update the destination lot's vehicles list
      - Update bidirectional exits
