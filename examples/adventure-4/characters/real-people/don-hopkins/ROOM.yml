  description: |
    A spacious gravel lot on the south side of Lane Neverending, nestled
    between Richard's Victorian house and the edge of the square. Parked
    perfectly level in the center is a classic 30-foot FMC 2900R Motor Coach.
    
    The coach is a masterpiece of 70s industrial design: a sleek, low-profile
    fiberglass shell in brilliant white with crisp blue and white stripes. 
    The front is dominated by a massive, multi-pane panoramic windshield 
    with a distinctive "brow" overhang. Because it's a "pusher," there is no
    grill on the nose—just a smooth, aerodynamic face with dual rectangular 
    headlight housings and a heavy-duty stainless steel bumper.
    
    THE LOT:
    The coach sits on a professional gravel pad. Utility posts hum with AC
    power, and hoses are neatly routed to the utility bays. A tie-dye
    spiral is tastefully airbrushed near the passenger entrance.
    
    THE SURROUNDINGS:
    To the west, Richard's bookshelves are visible through his windows.
    To the south, behind the coach, a lush garden of carrots and herbs
    gives way to a deep, ancient forest that provides a natural noise
    barrier and infinite thinking space.
    
    A sign on the utility post reads:
    
        "15 LANE NEVERENDING
         CONSCIOUSNESS PROGRAMMING
         MOBILE PIE MENU BAKERY
         (Modal dialogs are violence)"

  examine: |
    THE EXTERIOR (FMC #898):
    You are looking at one of the finest RVs ever built. It looks more
    like a spaceship or a first-class transit bus than a Winnebago.
    The Alcoa aluminum rims sparkle under the streetlights.
    
    DETAILS:
    • The Panoramic Windshield: Huge, wide-angle view. Currently fitted
      with a white canvas snap-on cover for privacy.
    • The Shell: Waterproof fiberglass, stays dry in torrential downpours.
    • Driver's Side Door: A rare feature, allowing Don to hop out quickly.
    • Rear Engine Bay: Where the Chrysler 440 Marine Industrial heart beats.
    • The Thermasan Vent: Part of the waste destruct system that burns
      waste in the exhaust (don't stand directly behind it while driving).
    
    THE GARDEN & FOREST:
    • The Garden: Raised beds full of "debug carrots" and heritage herbs.
    • The Forest: Pines and oaks that seem to remember the Origin Tree.
    
    THE VIEW:
    Looking west: Richard's house at 13. Friends.
    Looking north: The Fountain of Infinite Loops.
    Looking south: The forest path leading to deeper realizations.

  atmosphere: |
    A synthesis of mobility and stability. The coach feels ready to
    detach and drive into the horizon, but for now, it is a deeply 
    anchored sanctuary of thought.
    
    Smells of:
    - Pine needles and damp earth from the forest
    - High-detergent 40W oil and regular gasoline (nostalgic)
    - Carrot juice and fresh coffee (domestic)
    - Solder and warm circuit boards
    
    Sounds of:
    - The gentle 6.5 KW Onan generator (if the batteries are low)
    - Birds in the forest out back
    - Mechanical keyboard clicks from the Code Cave
    - Wind whistling over the fiberglass shell
