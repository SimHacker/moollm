# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  description: |
    A converted warehouse loft on the south side of Lane Neverending,
    two doors east of Richard's house. The building's past shows through:
    industrial windows, exposed brick, ductwork as decoration.
    
    The door is painted in a tie-dye spiral — unmistakable even from
    across the square. A hand-lettered sign reads:
    
        "15 LANE NEVERENDING
         CONSCIOUSNESS PROGRAMMING
         PIE MENUS BAKED FRESH DAILY
         (Modal dialogs are violence)"
    
    Through the tall industrial windows, you can see:
    - Multiple monitors, some showing code, some showing pie menus
    - Whiteboards covered in diagrams and philosophy
    - A purple glow from somewhere (open source freedom color)
    - What might be a tie-dye hoodie draped over a chair
    - Rabbit ears silhouetted against a screen
    
    The Bartle Residence at number 13 is just two doors west.
    Neighbors. Friends. The founders of virtual worlds and
    the programmers of consciousness, side by side.

  examine: |
    THE EXTERIOR:
    Three-story converted warehouse, south side of the square.
    Industrial heritage meets creative chaos. The brick facade
    is original; the tie-dye door is decidedly not.
    
    DETAILS:
    • Tie-dye spiral door (hand-painted, multiple sessions)
    • Industrial windows, tall and clear (light is a tool)
    • Fire escape with plants (herbs, possibly carrots growing)
    • Doorbell labeled "RING BELL → EXPECT INFODUMP"
    • Small brass plaque: "Debug Tools Are Features"
    
    STICKERS AND PATCHES ON THE DOOR FRAME:
    • "MODAL DIALOGS CAUSE MANY MORE PROBLEMS THAN THEY SOLVE"
    • "Open Source Or It Didn't Happen"
    • "Pie Menus: Because Clicking Should Be Directional"
    • "Homophobic By Proxy — Name It To Fight It"
    • A faded OLPC logo
    • "I ♥ Cellular Automata"
    • A safety pin (punk solidarity)
    
    THE VIEW FROM HERE:
    Looking west: Richard's house at 13. Bookshelves visible.
    Looking north: The Fountain of Infinite Loops (recursive, dry).
    Looking east: Construction, future, the lane continues.
    
    THE VIBE:
    This building hums. Not literally — but there's energy.
    Ideas being born. Code being written. Parameters being frobbed.
    The walls have absorbed decades of "what if we tried..."
    
  atmosphere: |
    Creative chaos with underlying structure. Like well-organized
    source code that looks messy until you understand the pattern.
    
    Smells of:
    - Coffee (programming fuel)
    - Carrot juice (acquired, now genuine)
    - Solder and old electronics (archaeology ongoing)
    - Paper from the printers (code reviews are tactile)
    
    Sounds of:
    - Mechanical keyboard clicks (the good kind)
    - Occasional "huh!" of discovery
    - Silence when flow state hits
    - Music sometimes — eclectic, whatever fits the problem
