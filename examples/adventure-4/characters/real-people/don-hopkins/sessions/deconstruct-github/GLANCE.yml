# GLANCE: Deconstructing GitHub as Literature

emoji: 📚
thesis: GitHub artifacts are a new literary genre
method: Annie Hall Protocol (invoke actual authorities)

authorities:
  - Chip Morningstar: "How to Deconstruct Almost Anything"
  - Marshall McLuhan: "The medium is the message"

key_insights:
  - Commit messages have functions beyond documentation
  - GitHub conventions suppress uncertainty and emotion
  - Violating conventions is rhetorical
  - Scholarship and practice merge in the same artifact
  - @-mentions enable instant authority invocation

example: OpenBFD's commit messages are bug fixes + essays + critique
