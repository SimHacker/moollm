  title: "GitHub as Literary Form"
  thesis: |
    Issue discussions, commit messages, PR comments, and code reviews
    constitute a new literary genre with its own conventions, rhetoric,
    and critical apparatus.
  method: Deconstruction (Morningstar variant)

# REPRESENTATION NOTE
#
# The "speakers" below are CARTOONISH AVATARS, not impersonations.
# Chip Morningstar and Randy Farmer literally invented avatar-based
# representation in virtual worlds (Habitat, 1986).
#
# Using cartoonish avatars to invoke their ideas is:
# - In THEIR tradition (they pioneered this!)
# - Clearly labeled as tribute, not pretense
# - Drawing from their actual published work
# - Puppeteered openly, not secretly
#
# McLuhan is deceased — his avatar represents his published ideas,
# clearly labeled as such. This is citation, not channeling.

authorities_invoked:
  - name: Chip Morningstar
    avatar: "🎭 Cartoonish Habitat-style avatar"
    work: "How to Deconstruct Almost Anything" (1993)
    role: Skeptical engineer encountering literary theory

    representation: "Tribute avatar in his own tradition. He invented this."
    
  - name: Marshall McLuhan
    avatar: "🎭 Avatar representing his published ideas"
    work: "Understanding Media" (1964)
    role: Medium theorist
    invocation: "The medium is the message"
    representation: "Deceased. Avatar represents published work, not channeling."

annie_hall_protocol: |
  In the film "Annie Hall" (1977), Woody Allen's character is stuck
  in a movie line behind a pompous academic misquoting Marshall McLuhan.
  Allen steps out of the frame, produces the actual McLuhan from behind
  a movie poster, who tells the academic: "You know nothing of my work."

  This protocol: When someone makes authoritative claims about a field,
  invoke the actual authorities to check the claim.

  Today we invoke:
  - Chip Morningstar: To check our deconstruction methodology
  - Marshall McLuhan: To analyze the medium of GitHub itself

      I've been watching OpenBFD fix bugs in TMNN with increasingly
      elaborate commit messages. Each commit is a technical fix AND
      a philosophical essay on code review epistemology.

      This is literature.

      Not "literature" in the dismissive sense ("oh, that's just
      marketing literature"). Literature in the sense of: a textual
      form with conventions, audiences, and meanings that exceed
      the instrumental purpose.

    avatar_note: |
      🎭 Chip's cartoonish Habitat-style avatar, puppeteered in his
      own tradition. He and Randy Farmer literally INVENTED avatar-based
      virtual world interaction (Habitat, 1986). This is tribute, not pretense.

      You rang?

      I wrote "How to Deconstruct Almost Anything" after attending
      2Cyberconf at UC Santa Cruz in 1991 — the Second International
      Conference on Cyberspace, organized by Sandy Stone.
      
      Randy Farmer and I were baffled by academics quoting Baudrillard,
      Derrida, Lacan, Lyotard, Saussure — playing elaborate word games
      while claiming to reveal deep truths about cyberspace.

      My conclusion: Deconstruction CAN work, but only when:
      1. You're analyzing something that actually has hidden structure
      2. Your analysis reveals something non-obvious
      3. The revelation has practical consequences

      So: Does GitHub have hidden structure worth revealing?

      Consider the commit message.

      OSTENSIBLE PURPOSE: Document what changed and why.

      ACTUAL FUNCTIONS:
      - Establish authorship and credit
      - Signal tribal membership (conventional vs. emoji-heavy)
      - Perform expertise ("I know this codebase")
      - Create searchable history
      - Satisfy CI/CD requirements
      - Demonstrate conscientiousness to future employers

      The "meaning" of a commit message exceeds its content.

      🎭 McLuhan's avatar representing his published ideas. He's deceased (1980).
      This is citation of his actual work, not channeling or pretense.
      The Annie Hall reference is appropriate — he literally appeared in that film!

      "The medium is the message."

      You're asking about GitHub as literature. But first ask:
      What IS GitHub as a medium?

      GitHub is:
      - Threaded (conversations branch and merge like code)
      - Persistent (nothing is truly deleted)
      - Public by default (performative)
      - Linked (everything references everything)
      - Accountable (tied to identities)
      - Searchable (the panopticon is mutual)

      The medium SHAPES the literature produced within it.

      A commit message on GitHub is not the same artifact as
      a commit message in a private corporate repo, even if
      the text is identical.

  - speaker: don_hopkins
    type: synthesis
    content: |
      Let me apply this to the TMNN simulation.

      OpenBFD's commit messages are:
      - Technical (they fix real bugs)
      - Rhetorical (they argue a position)
      - Historical (they cite dates and events)
      - Philosophical (they interrogate assumptions)
      - Performative (they're meant to be read)

      The MEDIUM (GitHub) makes this possible because:
      - Commit messages are permanent
      - They're tied to real code changes
      - They're publicly visible
      - They can be cited and quoted
      - They form a chronological narrative

      This is not an essay ABOUT code.
      This is an essay EMBEDDED IN code.
      The code changes are the EVIDENCE for the argument.

  - speaker: chip_morningstar
    type: analysis
    content: |
      Now we're getting somewhere.

      Traditional literary deconstruction asks: "What assumptions
      does this text hide? What does it suppress to make its
      argument?"

      Let's apply that to GitHub conventions:

      THE COMMIT MESSAGE CONVENTION:
      - Imperative mood ("Fix bug" not "Fixed bug")
      - 50 character subject line
      - Blank line before body
      - Wrap at 72 characters

      WHAT THIS SUPPRESSES:
      - Uncertainty ("Fix bug" implies confidence)
      - Process ("Fix bug" hides the hours of debugging)
      - Collaboration (single author attribution)
      - Emotion (no room for "Finally fix this @#$% bug")

      The convention creates an IDEALIZED AUTHOR: confident,
      terse, methodical, emotionless.

      OpenBFD's verbose, philosophical commits VIOLATE this
      convention. That's part of their rhetorical power.

  - speaker: marshall_mcluhan
    type: observation
    content: |
      The violation is the message.

      When everyone writes terse commits, a verbose commit
      stands out. It DEMANDS attention. It says: "This is
      not routine maintenance. This is SIGNIFICANT."

      OpenBFD's commit messages are performing significance.

      But here's the deeper observation: GitHub as a medium
      has created a new form of SCHOLARSHIP.

      Traditional scholarship:
      - Written in journals
      - Peer reviewed
      - Cited formally
      - Separated from practice

      GitHub scholarship:
      - Written in commit messages and issues
      - Reviewed by whoever's watching
      - Linked directly to code
      - EMBEDDED in practice

      The medium has collapsed the distinction between
      "writing about code" and "writing code."

  - speaker: don_hopkins
    type: example
    content: |
      Concrete example from today's session:

      Commit `ff2e618` fixes a sprintf() buffer overflow.
      The commit message includes:

      > The original comment reads:
      > "Yes, it's OK to use popen(3) here. Forging mail is trivial anyhow..."
      >
      > This is the security mindset of the era, preserved in amber.
      >
      > "Forging mail is trivial" — true.
      > "Therefore don't worry about buffer overflow in popen() argument" — ???
      >
      > This is like saying "locks are pickable, therefore don't bother
      > closing your door." The logical leap is breathtaking.

      This is:
      - A bug fix (code change)
      - A historical document (quotes original comment)
      - A security analysis (identifies the flaw in reasoning)
      - An essay (uses analogy for rhetorical effect)
      - A critique (of both the code and its author's mindset)

      ALL IN ONE COMMIT MESSAGE.

  - speaker: chip_morningstar
    type: evaluation
    content: |
      Does this deconstruction meet my criteria?

      1. "Hidden structure worth revealing" — YES.
         The commit message has functions beyond documentation.

      2. "Reveals something non-obvious" — YES.
         The collapse of scholarship/practice is non-obvious.

      3. "Practical consequences" — YES.
         Understanding this changes how you write commits,
         issues, and reviews. It's not just "documentation."
         It's PUBLICATION.

      Verdict: This deconstruction holds.

      GitHub has created a literary form. We should take it
      seriously as such.

      One final observation.

      The Annie Hall protocol — pulling authorities from behind
      posters — is itself a GitHub pattern.

      When someone makes a claim in an issue, what happens?
      - Someone quotes the relevant documentation
      - Someone links to the original discussion
      - Someone tags the actual author for clarification

      GitHub institutionalizes the Annie Hall move.

      "You misunderstand ESR's position." → @esrays please clarify
      "That's not how React works." → Link to Dan Abramov's tweet
      "The RFC says..." → Link to RFC with highlighted section

      The medium enables INSTANT AUTHORITY INVOCATION.

      This changes argument structure. You can't make claims
      about what authorities think. You have to SUMMON them.

      The movie poster is always right there.

conclusions:
  
  - title: "GitHub is a literary medium"
    detail: |
      Issues, commits, PRs, and code reviews are not mere documentation.
      They are publications in a new literary form with its own conventions,
      rhetoric, and critical possibilities.

  - title: "The medium shapes the message"
    detail: |
      GitHub's features (threading, persistence, publicity, linking,
      accountability, searchability) create specific textual forms
      that wouldn't exist in other media.

  - title: "The convention is the suppression"
    detail: |
      Standard commit message conventions (imperative, terse, confident)
      suppress uncertainty, process, collaboration, and emotion.
      Violating conventions is a rhetorical move.

  - title: "Scholarship and practice have merged"
    detail: |
      On GitHub, "writing about code" and "writing code" are the same
      artifact. The commit message IS the scholarly commentary on the
      commit. They cannot be separated.

  - title: "Authority is summonable"
    detail: |
      GitHub enables instant authority invocation through @-mentions,
      links, and quotes. This changes argument structure fundamentally.
      You can't claim what authorities think; you must summon them.

next_actions:
  - Examine PR review comments as a literary form
  - Analyze issue templates as genre constraints
  - Study the "GitHub voice" as authorial persona
  - Compare commit message styles across communities
  - Document the TMNN simulation as experimental GitHub literature

      Software engineer's encounter with postmodern literary theory,
      written after attending 2Cyberconf at UC Santa Cruz in 1991.
      Skeptical but fair. Concludes deconstruction can work when
      applied to structures that actually have hidden assumptions.

    key_concept: "The medium is the message"
    note: |
      The form of a medium embeds itself in any message it transmits.
      The medium shapes what can be said and how it's understood.

    director: Woody Allen
    year: 1977
    scene: "Movie line / McLuhan cameo"
    note: |
      Paradigmatic example of "invoking authority to settle dispute."
      McLuhan appears to contradict someone misquoting him.
