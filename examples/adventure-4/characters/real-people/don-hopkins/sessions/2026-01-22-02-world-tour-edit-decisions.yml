# Editorial Decision Timeline — Step by step reasoning for each file edit
#
# WHY THIS FILE? WHY THIS EDIT? WHAT ALTERNATIVES EXISTED?
# This is the "show your work" for the World Tour Party session.

session:
  request: |
    BOOT MOOLLM as Don Hopkins in the pub, and gather a party of four dogs 
    four cats and one monkey, to take a tour around the world and mark things 
    and let nature take its course.
    
  key_requirements:
    - Boot MOOLLM (follow boot sequence)
    - Play as Don Hopkins
    - Location: the pub
    - Party: 4 dogs + 4 cats + 1 monkey = 10 total members
    - Activity: world tour, marking things, emergent behavior

# DECISION 1: Which file holds party state?

decision_1:
  question: "Where should party membership be recorded?"
  
  options_considered:
    
    option_a:
      file: "ADVENTURE.yml"
      approach: "Record party.members[] in the central simulation state"
      pros:
        - "ADVENTURE.yml IS the simulation — reading it loads the world"
        - "All state in one place — easy to see party at a glance"
        - "Matches existing schema (party.members was already defined)"
        - "No new files needed"
      cons:
        - "Party info not portable — lives only in this adventure"
        - "Character files don't know they're in a party"
        
    option_b:
      file: "Create new PARTY.yml file"
      approach: "Separate party manifest"
      pros:
        - "Party becomes portable — can be reused in other adventures"
        - "Cleaner separation of concerns"
      cons:
        - "Another file to maintain"
        - "ADVENTURE.yml would need to reference it"
        - "More complexity for a simple operation"
        
    option_c:
      file: "Edit each CHARACTER.yml"
      approach: "Add party: membership field to each character"
      pros:
        - "Characters know their own party membership"
        - "Distributed state — no central point of failure"
      cons:
        - "10 file edits instead of 1"
        - "Party composition requires scanning all characters"
        - "Coordination problem — who's canonical?"
        
  decision: "Option A — Edit ADVENTURE.yml"
  
  reasoning: |
    The adventure skill's state schema (in skills/adventure/CARD.yml) already
    defines party.members[] as an array of character paths. The file header
    says "This file IS the simulation" — so adding party members here is
    the canonical location.
    
    MOOLLM principle: FILES-AS-STATE means state lives in files, but that
    doesn't mean EVERY file. It means the RIGHT file. ADVENTURE.yml is
    the simulation manifest — party composition belongs there.
    
    The skills/party/CARD.yml spec shows party-schema expects:
    - name (string)
    - members (array of paths)
    - leader (path)
    - location (path)
    - shared-inventory (array)
    - inter-party-relationships (object)
    
    ADVENTURE.yml already had party.members and party.leader — I just
    needed to expand them.

# DECISION 2: Which dogs to include?

decision_2:
  question: "Which 4 dogs from the available characters?"
  
  available_dogs:
    adults:
      - dog-biscuit      # Has full CHARACTER.yml, dreams/, JOURNAL.md
      - dog-butterscotch # Has full CHARACTER.yml
    puppies:
      - puppy-bruno
      - puppy-dash
      - puppy-goliath
      - puppy-maple
      - puppy-mochi
      - puppy-pepper
      - puppy-teddy
      - puppy-ziggy
      
  selection_criteria:
    - "Mix of adults and puppies for variety"
    - "Adults for stability, puppies for chaos"
    - "Characters with existing development preferred"
    - "Personality diversity"
    
  chosen:
    - dog-biscuit:
        reason: "Most developed dog character — has dreams/, journal, incarnation file"
        personality: "Dreamer, Butterscotch's best friend"
        
    - dog-butterscotch:
        reason: "Biscuit's companion — including both maintains their bond"
        personality: "Loyal, warm, reliable"
        
    - puppy-dash:
        reason: "Name suggests speed/energy — good for 'let nature take its course'"
        personality: "Speed demon, ALL CAPS enthusiasm"
        
    - puppy-ziggy:
        reason: "Name suggests quirky patterns — interesting behavior potential"
        personality: "Pattern-obsessed, friendly chaos"
        
  not_chosen:
    - puppy-bruno: "Generic — no strong reason to include over others"
    - puppy-goliath: "Name suggests size, but all puppies are small"
    - puppy-maple: "Sweet name but no distinguishing hook"
    - puppy-mochi: "Food-themed — could have been good but Dash/Ziggy more dynamic"
    - puppy-pepper: "Spicy name but less action-oriented than Dash"
    - puppy-teddy: "Cuddly connotation — less about exploration"
    
  reasoning: |
    The request was for 4 dogs. I chose 2 adults + 2 puppies because:
    
    1. Adults provide stability — Biscuit and Butterscotch are established
       characters with existing backstory and relationships.
       
    2. Puppies provide energy — per skills/dog/CARD.yml, puppies are
       "Maximum chaos, maximum cute, clumsy" which fits "let nature take
       its course."
       
    3. Biscuit + Butterscotch are described as "best friends" — keeping
       them together respects their relationship.
       
    4. Dash + Ziggy have action-oriented names that suggest movement and
       exploration — perfect for a world tour.

# DECISION 3: Which cats to include?

decision_3:
  question: "Which 4 cats from the available characters?"
  
  available_cats:
    adults:
      - cat-terpie        # Matriarch, Palm's god-spouse
      - cat-stroopwafel   # Sharp-eyed, Palm's god-spouse
    kittens:
      - kitten-myrcene
      - kitten-limonene
      - kitten-linalool
      - kitten-pinene
      - kitten-caryophyllene
      - kitten-humulene
      - kitten-terpinolene
      - kitten-ocimene
      
  selection_criteria:
    - "MUST include Terpie and Stroopwafel — they're Palm's godfamily"
    - "Palm is in the party, so his family should be represented"
    - "Mix of adults and kittens mirrors dog selection"
    - "Kittens with described personalities from Palm's CHARACTER.yml"
    
  chosen:
    - cat-terpie:
        reason: "REQUIRED — Palm's god-spouse (mother), matriarch of cats"
        personality: "Ancient soul, silver-streaked, slow blinks"
        relationship: "Palm's godfamily"
        
    - cat-stroopwafel:
        reason: "REQUIRED — Palm's god-spouse (father), judge"
        personality: "Sharp-eyed, protective, secretly sweet"
        relationship: "Palm's godfamily"
        
    - kitten-myrcene:
        reason: "Palm's godkitten — described in Palm's CHARACTER.yml"
        personality: "Stalks grey mouse toys, first to climb on Palm's head"
        relationship: "Palm's first godkitten mentioned"
        
    - kitten-limonene:
        reason: "Palm's godkitten — most energetic per Palm's file"
        personality: "CHASE CHASE CHASE, jingle balls, keeps Palm young"
        relationship: "Palm's most energetic godkitten"
        
  not_chosen:
    - kitten-linalool: "Gentle personality — less visible in action tour"
    - kitten-pinene: "Acrobatic but Limonene already covers energy"
    - kitten-caryophyllene: "Guard kitten — protective but static"
    - kitten-humulene: "Destroyer — might be too chaotic"
    - kitten-terpinolene: "Catnip guardian — specific role doesn't fit tour"
    - kitten-ocimene: "Brings weird gifts — interesting but passive"
    
  reasoning: |
    The cat selection was constrained by Palm's godfamily relationships:
    
    1. Palm's CHARACTER.yml (lines 759-851) defines his godfamily:
       - God-spouses: Terpie and Stroopwafel
       - Godkittens: All 8 kittens (Myrcene through Ocimene)
       
    2. Including Palm without his family would be incomplete — they're
       described as deeply bonded. The cats chose him. He is family.
       
    3. I included BOTH adult cats (Terpie and Stroopwafel) because:
       - They're the cat parents — leading the kittens
       - They represent different cat personalities (serene vs judge)
       - They're both Palm's god-spouses
       
    4. For the 2 kittens, I chose:
       - Myrcene: First-mentioned, first to climb on Palm's head
       - Limonene: "Most energetic, keeps me young" — best for action
       
    This creates a family unit: the cat matriarch/patriarch plus two
    of their most dynamic kittens.

# DECISION 4: Which monkey to include?

decision_4:
  question: "Which monkey? (There's only one)"
  
  available_monkeys:
    - monkey-palm: "The freed monkey, 122 years wise"
    
  chosen:
    - monkey-palm:
        reason: "ONLY monkey available — and perfect for the session"
        personality: "Open hand offering, ancient wisdom, freed from curse"
        
  reasoning: |
    Palm is the only monkey character in the adventure. This was an
    easy decision — but Palm is also PERFECT for a world tour:
    
    1. Palm was freed by Don's wish — they have a special bond.
       The CHARACTER.yml says: "He wished for ME, not from me."
       
    2. Palm's role as "observer, wisdom-keeper, occasional mischief"
       complements the dogs (sniffing/marking) and cats (judging/claiming).
       
    3. Palm's godfamily (Terpie, Stroopwafel, kittens) is in the party —
       keeping family together.
       
    4. Palm's marking protocol fits the world tour concept:
       "# 🐒 Palm observes: [observation]"
       Different from dogs and cats — he OBSERVES rather than claims.

# DECISION 5: What metadata to add to party?

decision_5:
  question: "What additional party fields beyond members[]?"
  
  fields_added:
    
    party_name:
      value: "The World Tour Party"
      why: |
        The party schema allows a name field. Naming creates identity.
        "The World Tour Party" describes the mission.
        
    comments_on_members:
      approach: "YAML Jazz — add # comments after each member path"
      examples:
        - "- characters/animals/dog-biscuit/      # The dreamer, Butterscotch's best friend"
        - "- characters/animals/puppy-dash/       # Speed demon, ALL CAPS enthusiasm"
      why: |
        MOOLLM principle: COMMENTS-MATTER / YAML-JAZZ
        Comments are semantic data. The LLM reads them.
        
        Adding personality snippets to each member:
        1. Reminds the DM of each character's role
        2. Can be read without loading individual CHARACTER.yml files
        3. Documents the selection reasoning inline
        
    party_dynamics:
      fields:
        - dogs_cats_ratio: "4:4 — balanced energy!"
        - dog_behavior: "sniff everything, mark territory, wag at discoveries"
        - cat_behavior: "investigate daintily, judge, claim territory with slow blinks"
        - monkey_role: "observer, wisdom-keeper, occasional mischief"
        - natural_behavior: true
      why: |
        The user said "let nature take its course."
        
        This section documents WHAT nature means for this party:
        - Dogs sniff and mark (per skills/dog/CARD.yml file_sniffing)
        - Cats judge and claim (per skills/cat/CARD.yml file_sniffing)
        - Palm observes (per his CHARACTER.yml identity)
        
        natural_behavior: true is a flag that tells the DM to let
        emergent behavior happen rather than scripting everything.

# DECISION 6: Update adventure metadata

decision_6:
  question: "What adventure-level changes to reflect the world tour?"
  
  changes_made:
    
    adventure_name:
      before: "Adventure 4 — A New Beginning"
      after: "Adventure 4 — The World Tour"
      why: "Rename to match the session's purpose"
      
    adventure_objective:
      before: "Explore the world, make friends, find purpose"
      after: "Tour the world with a party of dogs, cats, and a monkey. Mark things. Let nature take its course."
      why: "Capture the specific goal from user request"
      
    adventure_status:
      before: "ready"
      after: "active"
      why: "The adventure is now running, not waiting to start"
      
    adventure_started:
      before: "null"
      after: "2026-01-22T00:00:00Z"
      why: "Timestamp when adventure began"
      
    new_world_tour_section:
      added: true
      fields:
        - spirit: "Narrative description of what the tour means"
        - marking_protocol: "How each species marks territory"
        - destinations: "List of planned locations"
      why: |
        The user's request had specific elements:
        - "tour around the world" → destinations list
        - "mark things" → marking_protocol for dogs/cats/monkey
        - "let nature take its course" → spirit description
        
        Adding this section documents the RULES of the world tour
        so future turns can reference them.

# DECISION 7: Update navigation state

decision_7:
  question: "Where does the adventure start?"
  
  changes_made:
    
    starting_room:
      before: "garden/"
      after: "pub/"
      why: |
        User said "in the pub" — The Rusty Lantern is the gathering point.
        The original starting_room was garden/ from a previous session.
        Changed to match user's stated location.
        
    current_room:
      before: "garden/"
      after: "pub/"
      why: "Current room should match starting room at session start"
      
    rooms_visited:
      before: "[]"
      after: "[pub/]"
      why: "The party is IN the pub, so it's been 'visited'"
      
  reasoning: |
    Navigation state tracks WHERE the party is. The user explicitly
    said "in the pub" so I updated:
    
    1. starting_room — where THIS session begins
    2. current_room — where the party IS right now
    3. rooms_visited — breadcrumb trail of exploration
    
    Note: I did NOT change player.location because that was already
    "pub/" — it was correct from a previous session.

# DECISION 8: What NOT to edit

decision_8:
  question: "What files were intentionally NOT edited?"
  
  not_edited:
    
    individual_character_files:
      files:
        - "characters/animals/dog-biscuit/CHARACTER.yml"
        - "characters/animals/cat-terpie/CHARACTER.yml"
        - "etc..."
      why: |
        Party membership is recorded in ADVENTURE.yml, not in each
        character's file. The character files define WHO the character
        is — not what party they're currently in.
        
        MOOLLM principle: State ownership matters.
        - CHARACTER.yml owns: personality, inventory, relationships
        - ADVENTURE.yml owns: party composition, current quest
        
        If I edited each character to add "party: World Tour Party",
        that would be duplicating state. ADVENTURE.yml is canonical.
        
    room_files:
      files:
        - "pub/ROOM.yml"
        - "garden/ROOM.yml"
      why: |
        Rooms don't change because a party entered them.
        The party's LOCATION changes — recorded in ADVENTURE.yml.
        The room remains static.
        
        Exception: If the party MARKS a file (dog pees, cat claims),
        THEN we'd edit that file. But that hasn't happened yet.
        
    skill_files:
      files:
        - "skills/dog/CARD.yml"
        - "skills/cat/CARD.yml"
        - "skills/adventure/CARD.yml"
      why: |
        Skills are definitions, not state.
        We READ skills to understand capabilities.
        We WRITE adventure state, not skill definitions.
        
    don_hopkins_character:
      file: "characters/real-people/don-hopkins/CHARACTER.yml"
      why: |
        Don's character file already had location: pub/
        Nothing about his CHARACTER changed — just his party.
        Party membership is in ADVENTURE.yml.

# SUMMARY

summary:
  
  total_files_edited: 1
  file_edited: "examples/adventure-4/ADVENTURE.yml"
  total_edits: 2
  lines_changed: "~55 lines added/modified"
  
  why_minimal_edits: |
    MOOLLM principle: MINIMAL-DIFF — Change only what's necessary.
    
    The user's request ("gather a party, tour, mark things") only
    required changes to ADVENTURE.yml because:
    
    1. Party membership → ADVENTURE.yml owns this
    2. Quest objective → ADVENTURE.yml owns this
    3. Current location → ADVENTURE.yml owns this
    
    No character files needed editing because joining a party
    doesn't change WHO the character is.
    
    No room files needed editing because the party entering
    doesn't change what the room IS.
    
    One file. Two edits. All state centralized. Clean.
    
  key_principles_followed:
    - MINIMAL-DIFF: "Only edit what needs to change"
    - FILES-AS-STATE: "State lives in files, the right files"
    - YAML-JAZZ: "Comments carry personality data"
    - COHERENCE-ENGINE: "Understand relationships before editing"

# 🐒 Palm observes: The edit was surgical. One file. Two cuts. The party exists.
# 🐕 Biscuit sniffed this decision log 2026-01-22 — smells like good reasoning!
# 🐱 Stroopwafel judges: adequate. *barely perceptible nod*
