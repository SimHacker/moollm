  purpose: |
    This probe documents exactly what went into the context assembly for
    the World Tour Party session. Every file read, every K-line activated,
    every state change made — all visible for introspection and debugging.
    
    Per MOOLLM principle: FILES-AS-STATE — no hidden memory.
    Per CURSOR driver: context is ADVISORY — this is documentation.
    Per cursor-mirror skill: watch yourself think.

# 🐒 Palm observes: The context is the world. The probe is the mirror.
# 🐕 Biscuit was here 2026-01-22
