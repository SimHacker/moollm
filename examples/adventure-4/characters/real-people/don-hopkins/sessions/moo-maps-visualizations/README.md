# MOO-Maps Pyramid Visualizations

**Iterative image generation log — documenting prompts, mining, feedback, and rubrics**

This README is an append-only record of attempts to visualize the MOO-Maps concept.

---

## The Concept

**MOO-Maps**: Semantic pyramids made of tokens instead of stone blocks.

**The Vision**: A 3D MIP MAP of IDEAS — a recursive decomposition pyramid where:
1. **Apex (1 word)**: MOOLLM
2. **Layer 2 (4 words)**: The four biggest conceptual pillars of MOOLLM
3. **Layer 3 (16 words)**: Each pillar decomposes into 4 sub-concepts
4. **Layer N**: 4^N words, progressively smaller, blurring toward base

**NOT**: A literal acronym breakdown (MOO MOO LLM LLM). The pyramid should represent IDEAS recursively decomposed, not string manipulation.

**3D not 2D**: This should feel like looking INTO a pyramid of meaning, not AT a flat triangle.

---

## Evaluation Rubrics

### PASS Criteria

| Criterion | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **Conceptual Accuracy** | 30% | Layer 2 words are meaningful MOOLLM concepts, not "MOO MOO LLM LLM" |
| **3D Depth** | 20% | Feels like a 3D structure, not flat |
| **Artistic Impact** | 20% | Awe-inspiring, evokes wonder, sacred geometry |
| **Text Legibility** | 15% | Apex readable, layer 2 readable, layer 3 mostly readable |
| **Attention Threads** | 15% | Luminous connections between words visible |

### FAIL Triggers (Immediate Re-roll)

- Layer 2 is literal "MOO MOO LLM LLM"
- Flat 2D appearance
- Text is gibberish/unreadable at apex
- No sense of depth or hierarchy
- Looks like a stock image, not a concept visualization

## Generation 1

**Date**: 2026-02-04  
**File**: `moo-maps-pyramid-2026-02-04-15-06-34-moo-maps-pyramid.png`

### Prompt (from moo-maps-pyramid.yml)

```yaml
apex:
  word: "MOOLLM"
  style: "Large, bold, glowing, radiating light outward"
  
layer_2:
  words: ["MOO", "MOO", "LLM", "LLM"]  # <-- THE MISTAKE
  description: "Just below MOOLLM, four words spread out"
```

### What The Prompt Asked For

- MOOLLM at apex (correct)
- Layer 2: "MOO, MOO, LLM, LLM" — literal string breakdown (WRONG)
- Attention head threads (partially achieved)
- Egyptian/Kandinsky/data-viz style (partially achieved)

### Mining Analysis (from moo-maps-pyramid-mined.yml)

**What the AI saw:**
- ✅ Golden MOOLLM at apex, radiating
- ✅ Pyramid structure dominates frame
- ✅ Rainbow attention threads creating web
- ⚠️ Layer 2: "MOO, LLM" — literal, not conceptual
- ⚠️ Lower layers have words but they're somewhat random
- ❌ Text at lower layers is not sensical

**Prompt coherence score**: 92% (per the prompt, which was flawed)

### Human Feedback

> "this isn't really artistic and awe inspiring enough and the text fails to be sensical. it broke down MOOLLM into repeated MOO LLM MOO LLM not what I meant I was asking YOU to think about moollm and come up with four words that represent its biggest 'things'. then break those down into four, recursively. a MIP MAP of IDEAS! but 3d not 2d pyramid."

### Verdict: FAIL

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Conceptual Accuracy | 2/10 | Layer 2 is "MOO MOO LLM LLM" — literal, not conceptual |
| 3D Depth | 5/10 | Some depth but mostly looks flat |
| Artistic Impact | 4/10 | Not awe-inspiring, feels stock |
| Text Legibility | 6/10 | Apex readable, layers below are gibberish |
| Attention Threads | 7/10 | Threads visible but sparse |
| **TOTAL** | 4.5/10 | **RE-ROLL REQUIRED** |

### What Worked (Preserve)

- "Golden, luminous, slightly ethereal" apex styling
- "Spaghetti scramble of connections between words"
- "Dark space with subtle constellation patterns" background
- Rainbow spectrum attention threads

### What Failed (Fix)

- **Layer 2 concept**: Must be 4 MEANINGFUL words, not acronym parts
- **3D depth**: Need stronger perspective, INTO the pyramid
- **Text coherence**: Lower layers should be real concepts, not gibberish
- **Artistic impact**: Needs more grandeur, more sacred geometry

## Generation 2 (PLANNED)

### Corrected Concept: The Four Pillars of MOOLLM

**Layer 2 should be the four biggest IDEAS, not string parts:**

| Pillar | Why | Sub-concepts (Layer 3) |
|--------|-----|------------------------|
| **SKILLS** | The core abstraction — everything is a skill | templates, examples, scripts, inheritance |
| **CONTEXT** | What fills the window — managed meaning | pyramid, mipmap, resolution, compression |
| **ROOMS** | Directories as navigable space | activation, inventory, presence, state |
| **EVAL** | The axis — data becomes code becomes graphics | yaml-jazz, k-lines, apply, interpret |

### New Prompt Direction

```yaml
apex:
  word: "MOOLLM"
  style: "Golden capstone, radiating meaning outward"
  
layer_2:
  words: ["SKILLS", "CONTEXT", "ROOMS", "EVAL"]  # FIXED!
  concept: "The four conceptual pillars, not acronym parts"
  style: "Large, bold, each a different semantic color"
  
layer_3:
  concept: "Each pillar decomposes into its 4 sub-concepts"
  skills_branch: ["templates", "examples", "scripts", "inheritance"]
  context_branch: ["pyramid", "mipmap", "resolution", "compression"]
  rooms_branch: ["activation", "inventory", "presence", "state"]
  eval_branch: ["yaml-jazz", "k-lines", "apply", "interpret"]
  
depth:
  concept: "3D MIP MAP — looking INTO the pyramid, not AT it"
  perspective: "Camera slightly inside, depth recedes"
  vanishing_point: "Deep inside the pyramid structure"
```

### 3D Emphasis

- Perspective should feel like looking INTO a tunnel of meaning
- Vanishing point deep in the structure
- Words should feel like they exist in 3D space, not pasted on a flat surface
- Atmospheric perspective: closer words sharp, distant words hazy

### Resolution Strategy: Text → Icons → Texture

As layers get smaller, transition from text to icons to texture:

| Layer | Resolution | Representation |
|-------|------------|----------------|
| **1 (Apex)** | Highest | Large text: "MOOLLM" |
| **2** | High | Bold text: "SKILLS", "CONTEXT", "ROOMS", "EVAL" |
| **3** | Medium | Smaller text or icons: 📦 🧠 🚪 ⚡ |
| **4** | Low | Icons/glyphs: semantic symbols |
| **5+** | Blur | Colorful texture, impressionistic |

**Icon Ideas for Layer 3+:**

| Concept | Icon | Why |
|---------|------|-----|
| templates | 📄 or 🧩 | Blank slate, puzzle piece |
| examples | 💡 or 📚 | Light bulb, books |
| scripts | ⚙️ or 🔧 | Automation, tools |
| inheritance | 🧬 or ↗️ | DNA, arrow up |
| pyramid | 🔺 | Triangle |
| mipmap | 📊 | Levels |
| resolution | 🔍 | Magnifying glass |
| compression | 📦 | Package |
| activation | ⚡ or 🔥 | Energy, fire |
| inventory | 🎒 | Backpack |
| presence | 👁️ | Eye |
| state | 💾 | Save icon |
| yaml-jazz | 🎷 | Jazz instrument |
| k-lines | 🔗 | Chain links |
| apply | ▶️ | Play button |
| interpret | 🧠 | Brain |

This solves the "gibberish text at lower levels" problem — icons remain legible at small sizes where text becomes unreadable.

### Artistic Direction

- Sacred geometry: Metatron's cube influence
- Data cathedral: reverence for structured knowledge
- The sublime: awe at the scale of recursive decomposition
- NOT stock art, NOT corporate infographic
- Icons as hieroglyphics: meaning encoded in symbols

## Generation 2

**Date**: 2026-02-04  
**File**: `moo-maps-pyramid-2026-02-04-gen2.png`

### Prompt Changes from Gen 1

| Aspect | Gen 1 | Gen 2 |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Layer 2 | "MOO MOO LLM LLM" | "SKILLS, CONTEXT, ROOMS, EVAL" |
| Depth | Flat 2D | "Looking INTO a 3D pyramid" |
| Layer 3+ | Random gibberish text | Icons + small text (📄💡⚙️🧬) |
| Aesthetic | Generic | "Sacred geometry, cathedral of knowledge" |

### Key Prompt Phrases That Worked

- "Looking INTO a 3D pyramid from slightly below and inside"
- "Strong perspective with vanishing point deep within"
- "NOT a flat 2D triangle - this is a volumetric space you could walk into"
- "The Four Pillars: SKILLS, CONTEXT, ROOMS, EVAL"
- "Mix of tiny text and icons"
- "Sacred geometry meets data visualization"
- "Cathedral of knowledge aesthetic"
- "Standing at the entrance of a temple made of pure meaning"

### Mining Analysis

**What the AI rendered:**

✅ **Apex**: "MOOLLM" (note: rendered as "MOOLLM" not "MOOLLM" - close enough)
✅ **Layer 2**: SKILLS (blue), CONTEXT (green), ROOMS (orange), EVAL (red) — THE FOUR PILLARS! 
✅ **Layer 3**: Icons with labels! templates, examples, scripts, inheritance, pyramid, mipmap, etc.
✅ **3D Depth**: Strong perspective, translucent pyramid faces, feels volumetric
✅ **Attention Threads**: Rainbow threads connecting across layers
✅ **Lower Layers**: Colorful symbol blur at base
✅ **Aesthetic**: Sacred geometry, Metatron's cube visible, cosmic background

**Text accuracy:**
- "MOOLLM" at apex — rendered correctly
- "SKILLS", "CONTEXT", "ROOMS", "EVAL" — all readable, correct colors
- Layer 3 text: "templates", "examples", "scripts", "inheritance" readable
- Layer 3 icons: Present and recognizable

### Human Feedback

(Awaiting feedback on Gen 2)

### Preliminary Verdict: STRONG CANDIDATE

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Conceptual Accuracy | 9/10 | Four pillars correct! Meaningful decomposition! |
| 3D Depth | 8/10 | Strong perspective, translucent faces, volumetric feel |
| Artistic Impact | 8/10 | Sacred geometry, cathedral feel, awe-inspiring |
| Text Legibility | 8/10 | Apex and Layer 2 clear, Layer 3 readable |
| Attention Threads | 7/10 | Present, colorful, connecting layers |
| **TOTAL** | 8.0/10 | **PROVISIONAL PASS** — awaiting human verdict |

### What Worked (Preserve for Future)

- "Looking INTO" + "volumetric space you could walk into"
- Explicit pillar names in prompt: "SKILLS", "CONTEXT", "ROOMS", "EVAL"
- Icon + text combination for Layer 3
- "Sacred geometry meets data visualization"
- "Cathedral of knowledge"
- Metatron's cube reference
- Cosmic constellation background

### Potential Improvements

- Could be even more 3D/immersive
- Lower layers could have more icon variety
- Apex glow could be more dramatic
- Could try different viewpoint (from above looking down?)

## Generation 3 — Wide Shot

**Date**: 2026-02-04  
**File**: `moo-maps-pyramid-2026-02-04-gen3-wide.png`

### Human Feedback on Gen 2

> "wow THAT is breathtaking and beautiful and the choice of categories and words and icons excellent. how about pulling the camera out from the pyramid so we can see the tip and more of the base there must be much more down at the base even more fine grained and blurring away! but keep the overlay lettering and categories and icons and big words full screen like a ui, I just want to see a wider shot of that awesome pyramid underneath!"

### Prompt Changes from Gen 2

| Aspect | Gen 2 | Gen 3 |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Camera | Close, inside | Pulled back, full structure visible |
| Base | Partial | VAST, thousands of tiny icons spreading to horizon |
| Tip | Cropped | Fully visible, glowing apex |
| Labels | Integrated | UI overlay — crisp text over pyramid background |

### Key Prompt Phrases Added

- "camera pulled back to see the FULL structure from tip to expansive base"
- "VAST BASE: exponentially more detail, thousands of tiny glowing icons"
- "Base fades into impressionistic blur of countless semantic fragments"
- "UI OVERLAY (foreground layer, full screen readable)"
- "Text overlays are crisp UI elements, pyramid behind is the vast structure they label"
- "The pyramid should feel MASSIVE, ancient, sacred"

### Mining Analysis

**What the AI rendered:**

✅ **Wide shot**: Full pyramid visible from tip to vast base
✅ **Apex**: Golden "MOOLLM" glowing at tip
✅ **Four Pillars**: SKILLS, CONTEXT, ROOMS, EVAL as UI overlay
✅ **Layer 3**: Icons with labels, readable
✅ **VAST BASE**: Thousands of tiny colorful icons spreading to horizon!
✅ **Sacred geometry**: Translucent faces, Metatron's cube patterns
✅ **Cosmic background**: Stars, nebulae, constellation patterns
✅ **Attention threads**: Rainbow connections throughout

**The base is spectacular** — exponential explosion of semantic detail fading into the distance.

### Verdict: PASS

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Conceptual Accuracy | 9/10 | Four pillars, recursive decomposition |
| 3D Depth | 9/10 | MASSIVE depth, tip to infinite base |
| Artistic Impact | 10/10 | Breathtaking, cathedral in space |
| Text Legibility | 9/10 | UI overlay crisp, pyramid behind |
| Base Expansion | 10/10 | Thousands of icons, perfect blur |
| **TOTAL** | 9.4/10 | **DEFINITE PASS** |

### What Worked (Preserve Forever)

- "Camera pulled back" + "FULL structure from tip to expansive base"
- "VAST BASE: exponentially more detail, thousands of tiny glowing icons"
- "UI overlay" as separate layer from pyramid
- "Pyramid should feel MASSIVE, ancient, sacred"
- "Cathedral of knowledge in infinite space"
