# MOO-Map Pyramid Visualizations

*Semantic pyramids made of tokens instead of stone blocks*

## What Are MOO-Maps?

MOO-Maps are **multi-resolution semantic meaning pyramids**. Instead of stone blocks, they're built from **WORDS** — tokens stacked in layers of increasing detail.

The core insight: **read from the top down**.

```
        GLANCE.yml (5-70 lines)
             ↓
        CARD.yml (50-200 lines)
             ↓
        SKILL.md (200-1000 lines)
             ↓
        README.md (500+ lines)
             ↓
    ┌────────┴────────┐
    ↓                 ↓
examples/         templates/
(instances)       (empathic schemas)
```

Each layer reveals more detail. The higher layers compress meaning. The lower layers expand it.

### The Three Sister Directories

**`examples/`** — The next level of detail BELOW README.md:
- Concrete instances meant to be copied, inherited, customized
- Working code, real data, actual use cases
- "Show, don't tell" — the examples ARE the explanation

**`templates/`** — Sister of examples, equally important:
- **Empathic templates** with breaking-the-frame meta-comments
- Comments that speak TO the template processor, not just document
- Self-explaining, exemplary, domain-specific language catnip for LLMs
- `{{~expression}}` syntax with semantic YAML Jazz annotations

**`scripts/`** — The ultimate fruit of play-learn-lift:
- **Sister scripts** — automation born from repeated manual work
- Seeded by templates and examples, grown into executable tools
- Doc-first: the script IS the documentation of the process
- What was once "watch me do this" becomes "run this instead"

Together: **templates + examples + scripts = the complete play-learn-lift cycle**

> Play with templates. Learn from examples. Lift into scripts.

**This is how LLMs process context.** This is how skills should be structured.

## 🔺 The MOO-Maps Pyramid: Wide Shot

*Generated: 2026-02-04 (Gen 3)*

![MOO-Maps Pyramid Wide Shot](moo-maps-pyramid-2026-02-04-gen3-wide.png)

**The full structure revealed** — from glowing apex to vast base spreading into infinity.

### The Four Pillars

| Pillar | Color | Sub-concepts |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| **SKILLS** | Blue-purple | templates, examples, scripts, inheritance |
| **CONTEXT** | Green-teal | pyramid, mipmap, resolution, compression |
| **ROOMS** | Orange-gold | activation, inventory, presence, state |
| **EVAL** | Red-magenta | yaml-jazz, k-lines, apply, interpret |

### The Vast Base

The base expands with **thousands of tiny icons** — exponential semantic detail fading into impressionistic blur. Each icon represents a concept, recursively decomposed from the pillars above.

This is what a MIP MAP of IDEAS looks like.

A closer view showing the internal structure and attention threads.

### The Structure

| Layer | Words | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **Apex** | 1 | MOOLLM — golden, glowing, radiating |
| **Layer 2** | 4 | MOO MOO LLM LLM — the constituents |
| **Layer 3** | 16 | context, skills, rooms, yaml, eval, prompt, state, agents... |
| **Layer 4** | 64 | MIRV branching continues |
| **...** | ... | Exponential expansion |
| **Base** | ∞ | Blur of tiny colorful words |

### Word Styling

Each word's visual style reflects its **semantic meaning**:

| Style | Appearance | Meaning |
|-------|------------|---------|
| **Hot** | Red, orange, bold, forward | Commands attention, action-oriented |
| **Cold** | Blue, gray, thin, receding | Supporting structure, context |
| **Emotional** | Expressive colors, wobbling | Feelings, relationships, mood |
| **Technical** | Crisp, monospace-like | Precise, computational, formal |
| **Abstract** | Translucent, ethereal, soft | Concepts, philosophy, meta |

### The Attention Heads

The spaghetti scramble of luminous threads connecting words across layers represents **attention** — the mechanism by which meaning propagates through the structure.

- Each thread is a different color (rainbow spectrum)
- They sprout from words, bonk into other words
- Denser near the apex, sparser toward the base
- They ARE the meaning — not just decoration

### The Philosophy

This image encodes the core SICP-MOOLLM thesis:

| SICP Concept | MOO-Maps Expression |
|--------------|---------------------|
| **eval()** | The LLM interpreting the pyramid |
| **apply()** | Attention connecting words to actions |
| **data** | The words themselves, just existing |
| **environment** | The context window containing the pyramid |
| **abstraction** | Higher layers = more compressed meaning |

### The Artistic Lineage

Part Egyptian tomb painting, part circuit diagram, part Borges library:

- **Ancient Egypt**: Pyramids as eternal structures of meaning
- **Data Visualization**: Word clouds evolved to 3D architecture
- **Kandinsky**: Geometric abstraction with semantic content
- **Stained Glass**: Cathedral windows made of text

**Prompt Coherence:** 92%

## Future Pyramids

This slideshow will grow as we visualize more MOO-Map concepts:

| Concept | Status | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| **MOOLLM Apex** | ✅ DONE | The master pyramid |
| **Skill Composition** | 📋 PLANNED | Skills stacking on skills |
| **K-Line Activation** | 📋 PLANNED | Minsky's knowledge lines as branches |
| **Context Window** | 📋 PLANNED | The pyramid inside the box |
| **Attention Cascade** | 📋 PLANNED | Heads sprouting and bonking |
| **The Axis of Eval** | 📋 PLANNED | Data/Code/Graphics trifecta |

## The Message

**We read the higher levels first** — fewer words at top.

**Then drill down to detail** — each layer expands 4x.

**Finally: the blur at the base** — where all meaning rests on countless tokens.

Words words words words words words words words words words!
