    Apply Morningstar's three-part test to the github-simulation skill stack:
    1. Is there hidden structure worth revealing?
    2. Does the analysis reveal something non-obvious?
    3. Are there practical consequences?

      I want to understand how the tmnn7-8 simulation actually works.
      
      Not just "it uses the gh CLI" — but the full architectural stack.
      How do skills compose? What patterns emerge? What's hidden?
      
      Let's apply Morningstar's test properly.

      Alright, let's be rigorous.
      
      In 1991, Randy Farmer and I attended 2Cyberconf — the Second
      International Conference on Cyberspace at UC Santa Cruz,
      organized by Sandy Stone.
      
      I was baffled. The academics seemed to be playing language games
      without any connection to verifiable truth. They quoted Baudrillard,
      Derrida, Lacan, Lyotard, Saussure. They debated whether cyberspace
      was "narrative." I couldn't figure out what any of it MEANT.
      
      But I didn't dismiss it entirely. I asked: when DOES deconstruction work?
      
      My answer: when it reveals hidden structure that has practical consequences.
      
      Three tests:
      1. Is there structure worth revealing?
      2. Is the revelation non-obvious?
      3. Are there practical consequences?
      
      If all three pass, the deconstruction is useful.
      If any fail, it's just word games.
      
      Let's test this github-simulation thing.

    title: "The Skill Stack"
    content: |
      Here's what I've found. The github-simulation skill inherits from:
      
      ```
      github-simulation
        ├── github           (gh CLI wrapper, Linus as patron)
        ├── adventure        (directory-as-room)
        ├── character        (CHARACTER.yml template)
        ├── simulation       (SIMULATION.yml state)
        ├── procedural-rhetoric  (rules embody arguments)
        └── representation-ethics (real people protection)
      ```
      
      Each layer adds something. The composition creates the full system.

    title: "Test 1: Hidden Structure?"
    content: |
      Is there structure worth revealing?
      
      Let me examine what's NOT obvious from surface reading:
      
      **The Delegation Pattern**
      
      github-simulation doesn't reinvent gh commands.
      It says: "I inherit from github. Use THEIR methods."
      
      ```yaml
      delegates_to_github:
        available_from_parent:
          issues: [ISSUE-CREATE, ISSUE-LIST, ...]
      ```
      
      This is hidden until you look for it. A naive reader might think
      each skill is self-contained.
      
      **The Patron Saint Pattern**
      
      The github skill has Linus Torvalds as "patron saint."
      But there's a rule: you CANNOT incarnate him.
      
      ```yaml
      linus_is_not_summonable: |
        You CANNOT summon or incarnate Linus directly.
        He is the PATRON SAINT — his wisdom infuses the skill,
        but he is not a playable character.
        
        Real people are not puppets.
      ```
      
      This is representation ethics BUILT INTO the skill structure.
      Hidden unless you read carefully.
      
      **The Procedural Rhetoric Layer**
      
      The simulation rules ARE the argument:
      - Only OpenBFD can commit fixes → "Show me the code"
      - Bug count is tracked → measurable progress matters
      - Characters can debate forever → talk without action is theater
      
      This isn't documented as "the argument." It emerges from the rules.
      
      **VERDICT: YES. Hidden structure exists.**

    note: "Co-author of Habitat, summoned for context"
    content: |
      This reminds me of Habitat.
      
      In 1986, Chip and I built the first large-scale virtual world.
      Lucasfilm's Habitat had 20,000 users.
      
      What we learned: "The implementation is not the world."
      
      Users didn't see our object database. They saw avatars, rooms, items.
      The technical structure was invisible. The experience was what mattered.
      
      Same thing here. Users don't see skill inheritance hierarchies.
      They see characters debating on GitHub issues.
      
      The hidden structure enables the visible experience.
      That's the pattern.

    title: "Test 2: Non-Obvious Revelation?"
    content: |
      Does the analysis reveal something that wasn't obvious before?
      
      **Revelation 1: Ethics as Architecture**
      
      The representation-ethics overlay isn't just a guideline.
      It's ENCODED in the skill structure.
      
      You literally cannot incarnate Linus because the skill
      refuses to provide that method. The ethics are structural,
      not advisory.
      
      This is non-obvious. Most ethics guidelines are documents.
      This one is architecture.
      
      **Revelation 2: The Medium IS the Simulator**
      
      github-simulation uses GitHub to simulate... GitHub development.
      The medium and the subject are the same thing.
      
      McLuhan said "the medium is the message."
      Here: the medium is also the content.
      
      This creates recursive possibilities: the simulation can comment
      on itself, using the same tools it simulates.
      
      **Revelation 3: Composability as Philosophy**
      
      The skill inheritance pattern isn't just technical.
      It's philosophical.
      
      "Don't reinvent — delegate" is a value system.
      "Ethics as structural constraint" is a value system.
      "Rules embody arguments" is a value system.
      
      The architecture encodes a worldview.
      
      **VERDICT: YES. Non-obvious insights emerge.**

    note: "Author of the postmodern paper in the pub attic"
    content: |
      *[materializes, coffee-stained papers in hand]*
      
      I wrote about this! Sort of. In the kitchen. During adventure-2.
      
      The paper's in the attic now. Someone spilled bong water on page 47.
      
      My insight was: MOOLLM's filesystem-as-world is the same pattern
      as Habitat's avatar-as-representation.
      
      Both recognize that virtual spaces are defined by INTERACTION,
      not implementation.
      
      The github-simulation skill extends this:
      GitHub-as-theater is defined by PERFORMANCE, not protocol.
      
      The gh CLI is just plumbing.
      The characters are the content.
      The debates are the drama.

    title: "Test 3: Practical Consequences?"
    content: |
      Are there practical consequences to understanding this?
      
      **Consequence 1: Building New Simulations**
      
      Understanding the composition pattern means you can build
      new simulations by combining skills differently.
      
      Want a simulation on GitLab? Replace github skill.
      Want different characters? Add to character directory.
      Want different rules? Modify procedural-rhetoric layer.
      
      The architecture is designed for extension.
      
      **Consequence 2: Ethical Guardrails**
      
      The representation-ethics pattern can be applied elsewhere.
      
      Building an AI that generates dialogue? Encode ethics structurally.
      Don't just write guidelines — make violations impossible.
      
      **Consequence 3: GitHub as Expressive Medium**
      
      Understanding GitHub-as-stage changes how you USE GitHub.
      
      Every commit is a monologue.
      Every issue is a scene.
      Every code review is criticism.
      
      You can use these forms intentionally, not just accidentally.
      
      **Consequence 4: Teaching Through Simulation**
      
      The tmnn7-8 simulation teaches:
      - Security practices (real bugs, real fixes)
      - Open source dynamics (endless discussion, sparse action)
      - Epistemology (what does "code review" actually check?)
      
      Learning through play beats learning through lecture.
      
      **VERDICT: YES. Practical consequences exist.**

      So Morningstar's test is passed.
      
      **Test 1:** Hidden structure exists (delegation, patron saints, procedural rhetoric)
      **Test 2:** Non-obvious insights emerge (ethics as architecture, recursion, composability)
      **Test 3:** Practical consequences follow (extension, guardrails, expression, teaching)
      
      This deconstruction is useful, not just word games.
      
      The github-simulation skill isn't just "a way to post comments."
      It's a philosophical architecture that:
      - Delegates technical work to specialized skills
      - Encodes ethics as structural constraints
      - Embodies arguments through rules
      - Creates recursive self-reference
      - Enables teaching through simulation

      Good. This is what deconstruction should look like.
      
      Not: "Everything is relative and words mean nothing."
      
      But: "Here is hidden structure. Here is what it reveals. Here is why it matters."
      
      The postmodernists I met in 1993 often failed test 3.
      They'd reveal hidden structure but couldn't explain why anyone should care.
      
      This analysis passes all three tests.
      It's legitimate intellectual work.
      
      Now go build something with it.

conclusions:
  - title: "The Deconstruction is Valid"
    detail: |
      github-simulation passes Morningstar's three-part test:
      1. Hidden structure (delegation, ethics, rhetoric)
      2. Non-obvious insights (architecture as philosophy)
      3. Practical consequences (extension, teaching, expression)

  - title: "Ethics Can Be Architecture"
    detail: |
      Representation-ethics isn't just a guideline — it's encoded in
      the skill structure. You can't violate it because the methods
      don't exist. This is a powerful pattern.

  - title: "Composability is Philosophy"
    detail: |
      The inheritance and delegation patterns encode values:
      reuse over reinvention, constraints over guidelines,
      rules as arguments. Technical choices are philosophical choices.

  - title: "The Medium is Recursive"
    detail: |
      Using GitHub to simulate GitHub development creates recursive
      self-reference. The simulation can comment on itself using
      the same tools it simulates.

  - title: "Teaching Through Simulation Works"
    detail: |
      The tmnn7-8 simulation teaches security, open source dynamics,
      and epistemology through play. The joke (endless discussion,
      sparse action) is also the lesson.

next_actions:
  - Create a MOOLLM skill for other forges (GitLab, Gitea)
  - Document the representation-ethics pattern for reuse
  - Build simulations for other domains (moderation, support)
  - Extend the tmnn7-8 cast with new characters
  - Write the wiki page documenting this session
