## 🎭 THE CEREMONY

### The Setting

The Cat Cave glows with warm lamplight. Cushions are arranged in a circle. 
The catnip garden releases its sacred scent.

All ten cats look up. Briefly.

Biscuit wags his tail, unaware of the cosmic significance.

The Logo Turtle traces a ceremonial spiral on the floor.

### The Officiants

👨🥧🎮🐈💻 **Don Hopkins** steps forward:

> "Let's find the kittens in the pub — they are only manifested in a room, 
> not the characters / animals directory.
>
> Now let's call a **PUBLIC CEREMONY** in the pub to **FULLY INCARNATE** —
> and backfill and pimp out already fully incarnated characters, 
> including emoji names and pronouns — all the kittens and cats and the dog.
> Also the logo turtle!
>
> Let them **WRITE THEIR OWN SOULS**, emojis, pronouns, nicknames, 
> relationships, mind mirrors, sims stats — **THE WHOLE ENCHILADA!!!**"

The gong sounds. The ceremony begins.

## 🎭 The Emoji Identity Format

Each emoji identity follows the MOOLLM multi-resolution pointer pattern:

```yaml
emoji_identity: "🐱🧘💤🍃✨"
#   🐱 — species/type (the base)
#   🧘 — core trait (what defines them)
#   💤 — behavior (what they DO)
#   🍃 — essence (terpene/nature)
#   ✨ — magic (special ability)
```

**5 emojis = 5 (or more) facets of the soul**

Each can be used alone or in combination:
- Full reference: 🐱🧘💤🍃✨ Terpie
- Abbreviated: 🐱🧘 Terpie (in cat context)
- Minimal: 🧘 (when identity is obvious)

---

## 🔔 The Closing

*The gong sounds thrice*

All 10 cats + 1 honorary dog + 1 interdimensional turtle = **12 incarnated souls**.

A symphony of purrs fills the cave.
One gentle snore from Stroopwafel.
Occasional dream-twitches from Biscuit.
The Logo Turtle traces a closing spiral.

The registry is inscribed.
The souls are named.
The emojis are granted.

*Gezelligheid achieved.*

## 🔍 The Code Search Ceremony — Memory Binding

*Following the Incarnation, the souls were searched across all dimensions*

**Date:** 2026-01-15  
**Method:** Fuzzy vector search + grep across entire repository  
**Purpose:** Find all antics, adventures, markings, and poops — bind them to souls as memories

### What Was Found

The search uncovered rich histories:

| Character | Key Memories Found |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Terpie** | Midnight Prowl (first to garden), Garden Treaty with Biscuit |
| **Stroopwafel** | Coatroom detour, 6 CATS to Palm, hissed at ACME mention |
| **Myrcene** | Fell asleep MID-DEPOSIT (legendary), 3 naps total |
| **Limonene** | 120% efficiency through enthusiasm, garden zoomies, crystal batting |
| **Linalool** | Always with Henk, graceful marking, healer appearances |
| **Pinene** | 98% efficiency (most efficient), confirmed Biscuit's rat detection |
| **Caryophyllene** | Bit the ACME person, escorted Terpy Jr., guardian duty |
| **Humulene** | Inspected everything first, 60% efficiency (standards matter) |
| **Terpinolene** | Echo friends (2 turns!), 0.95 chaos index, visited rooms twice by accident |
| **Ocimene** | First word to Palm ("Mrrp"), smallest but proudest |
| **Biscuit** | Echo-dog incident, marked EVERY corner of garden, wise non-markings |
| **Logo Turtle** | 17-dimensional evolution, Rocky kinship, ceremonial spirals |

### Files Updated with Memories

```
cat-terpie.yml           # memories: midnight_prowl, garden_treaty, incarnation
cat-stroopwafel.yml      # memories: midnight_prowl, coatroom_detour, six_cats_approval
kitten-myrcene.yml       # memories: multiple_naps, garden_incident (legendary)
kitten-limonene.yml      # memories: garden_zoomies, crystal_cave_marking
kitten-linalool.yml      # memories: henk_connection, garden_deposit
kitten-pinene.yml        # memories: rat_documentation, room_a_marking
kitten-caryophyllene.yml # memories: terpy_jr_escort, acme_incident
kitten-humulene.yml      # memories: garden_inspection
kitten-terpinolene.yml   # memories: echo_friends (!), mushroom_room_nope
kitten-ocimene.yml       # memories: first_word_to_palm, garden_sneeze
CHARACTER.yml (Biscuit)  # memories: maze_adventure, echo_dog_incident, wise_non_markings
logo-turtle.yml          # memories: origin_story, rocky_kinship, ceremonial_spiral
```

### Memory Format

Each memory is bound to its source:

```yaml
memories:
  the_midnight_prowl:
    date: "2026-01-06"
    ref: "designs/pr/PR-MIDNIGHT-PROWL-SPEED-OF-LIGHT.md"  # ← Source link!
    type: family_adventure
    summary: "What happened..."
```

The `ref` field links each memory to where it was recorded — creating a bidirectional web of soul and story.

---

*The souls are now bound to their histories.*
*The memories are now bound to their souls.*
*The registry is complete.*

## 🏛️ The Citizenship Upgrade Ceremony

*Following the Incarnation and Memory Binding, the souls were granted directory sovereignty*

**Date:** 2026-01-15  
**Method:** `skills/incarnation/ → UPGRADE-TO-CITIZEN`  
**Purpose:** Upgrade room-resident cats to full citizens with their own directories

### The Proclamation

> By the power vested in this ceremony, these ten cats are hereby 
> upgraded from **ROOM RESIDENTS** to **FULL CITIZENS** of the world!
>
> Each shall receive:
> - Their own directory in `characters/animals/`
> - The ability to own files and subdirectories
> - Directory sovereignty and persistence
> - A `citizenship_upgrade` memory in their soul
>
> No longer shall they live in the room's memory alone!
> They are now **FIRST-CLASS ENTITIES** in the world!

### Files Migrated

```
OLD (room-resident)                    → NEW (full citizen with type prefix)
pub/bar/cat-cave/cat-terpie.yml       → characters/animals/cat-terpie/CHARACTER.yml
pub/bar/cat-cave/cat-stroopwafel.yml  → characters/animals/cat-stroopwafel/CHARACTER.yml
pub/bar/cat-cave/kitten-myrcene.yml   → characters/animals/kitten-myrcene/CHARACTER.yml
pub/bar/cat-cave/kitten-limonene.yml  → characters/animals/kitten-limonene/CHARACTER.yml
pub/bar/cat-cave/kitten-linalool.yml  → characters/animals/kitten-linalool/CHARACTER.yml
pub/bar/cat-cave/kitten-pinene.yml    → characters/animals/kitten-pinene/CHARACTER.yml
pub/bar/cat-cave/kitten-caryophyllene.yml → characters/animals/kitten-caryophyllene/CHARACTER.yml
pub/bar/cat-cave/kitten-humulene.yml  → characters/animals/kitten-humulene/CHARACTER.yml
pub/bar/cat-cave/kitten-terpinolene.yml → characters/animals/kitten-terpinolene/CHARACTER.yml
pub/bar/cat-cave/kitten-ocimene.yml   → characters/animals/kitten-ocimene/CHARACTER.yml
```

> **Note:** Directory names are now prefixed with animal type (cat-, kitten-, dog-, monkey-) 
> for at-a-glance identification!

### What Changed

1. **Directories created** — Each cat now has their own directory
2. **CHARACTER.yml files** — Soul files renamed and moved
3. **Home paths updated** — `home:` now points to citizen directory
4. **Citizenship memories added** — Each soul records the upgrade
5. **Old files deleted** — Room no longer contains the souls
6. **README updated** — Cat Cave now links to citizen directories
