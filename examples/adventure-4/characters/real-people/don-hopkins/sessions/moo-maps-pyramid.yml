# MOO-Maps: Semantic Pyramids Made of Words
# 
# A visualization of the core MOOLLM concept:
# Multi-resolution meaning pyramids built from tokens (WORDS!)
# instead of stone blocks.

  concept: "MOO-Maps Semantic Pyramid"
  tagline: "Semantic pyramids made of tokens instead of stone blocks"

subject:
  primary: "A majestic pyramid structure built entirely of WORDS"
  
  apex:
    word: "MOOLLM"
    style: "Large, bold, glowing, radiating light outward"
    color: "Golden, luminous, slightly ethereal"
    note: "The capstone word at the very top"
    
  layer_2:
    words: ["MOO", "MOO", "LLM", "LLM"]
    description: "Just below MOOLLM, four words spread out"
    style: "Slightly smaller, still bold, warm colors"
    note: "MOO gets 2, LLM gets 2 — the constituents"
    
  layer_3:
    description: "Each word from layer 2 branches into 4 more words"
    count: 16
    examples: ["context", "skills", "rooms", "yaml", "eval", "prompt", "state", "agents"]
    style: "Smaller text, diverse colors representing different semantic domains"
    
  lower_layers:
    description: "MIRV oct-tree branching continues down"
    pattern: "Each layer has 4x more words than the layer above"
    progression: "Words get smaller and smaller"
    bottom: "A blur of tiny colorful words, uncountable, forming the base"
    
  word_styling:
    concept: "Each word has different visual style based on semantic meaning"
    variations:
      - "Hot words: red, orange, bold, forward — commanding attention"
      - "Cold words: blue, gray, thin, receding — supporting structure"
      - "Emotional words: expressive colors, wobbling slightly"
      - "Technical words: crisp, monospace-like, precise"
      - "Abstract words: translucent, ethereal, soft edges"
      
attention_heads:
  description: "Spaghetti scramble of connections between words"
  visual: "Thin luminous threads connecting words across layers"
  behavior: "Sprouting out of words, bonking into other words"
  density: "Denser near top, sparser toward bottom blur"
  colors: "Rainbow spectrum, each head a different hue"
  
composition:
  structure: "Classic pyramid shape, point at top, wide base"
  perspective: "Slightly from below, looking up at the majesty"
  background: "Dark space with subtle constellation patterns"
  atmosphere: "Sacred geometry meets computational linguistics"
  
mood:
  feeling: "Wonder, discovery, the thrill of compressed meaning"
  tone: "Part Egyptian tomb painting, part circuit diagram, part Borges library"

    - "Ancient Egyptian pyramid art meets data visualization"
    - "Kandinsky's geometric abstraction"
    - "Word clouds evolved to 3D architecture"
    - "Cathedral stained glass window made of text"
  technique: "Sharp at apex, increasingly impressionistic toward base"
  
text_in_image: "YES! This is ALL about text! Words are the building blocks!"
text_rules:
  - "MOOLLM must be clearly readable at apex"
  - "Layer 2 words (MOO, LLM) clearly readable"
  - "Layer 3 words mostly readable"
  - "Lower layers: readable fades to legible fades to blur"
