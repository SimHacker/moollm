philosophical_content:
  core_message: |
    MOOLLM is built from words all the way down.
    Each layer reveals more detail.
    Attention connects everything.
    Meaning emerges from structure.
  
  sicp_connection: |
    This is the visual metaphor for SICP-MOOLLM:
    Skills as pyramids of meaning
    Context as layers of resolution
    The LLM as the eval() that interprets
    
prompt_coherence: 92%
notes: |
  The image successfully captures the core MOO-Maps concept:
  semantic pyramids built from words, with multi-resolution reading
  and attention-based connections. The visual hierarchy reinforces
  the GLANCE→CARD→SKILL→README progression.
