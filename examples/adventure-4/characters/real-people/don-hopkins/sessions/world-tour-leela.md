**Hotel Floor Navigation (Hub & Spoke — Pie Menu Model):**
| From | Direction | To |
|------|-----------|-----|
| Pub | up | Landing |
| Landing | down | Pub |
| Landing | up | Attic |
| Attic | down | Landing |
| Landing | room 1 | Room 1 |
| Landing | room 2 | Room 2 |
| Landing | room 3 | Room 3 |
| Landing | room 4 | Room 4 |
| Landing | room 5 | Room 5 |
| Landing | room 6 | Room 6 |
| Landing | room 7 | Room 7 |
| Landing | room 8 | Room 8 |
| Room 1-8 | out | Landing |

**Pie Menu Model:** All 8 rooms connect ONLY to the central Landing. Rooms do not connect to each other. The Landing has:
- Up stairs to Attic
- Down stairs to Pub
- Shared facilities (ice machine, soda machine, signage)

### The Spatial Models — Don Explains

*Don pauses at the Landing, gesturing at the eight doors arranged around them.*

**Don:** "Let me explain the spatial models we use. There are three patterns here, and they all serve different purposes."

#### Model 1: Hub & Spoke (Pie Menu)

**Don:** "The hotel floor uses the **pie menu model**. Eight rooms, one central hub. Every room connects ONLY to the hub — not to each other."

```
         [1] [2] [3] [4]
               ↘ ↓ ↙
              LANDING
               ↗ ↑ ↖
         [5] [6] [7] [8]
```

**Don:** "Why? Because the hub is special. It has the stairs, the ice machine, the shared facilities. If you want to go from Room 1 to Room 8, you MUST pass through the hub. This creates natural traffic, natural encounters, natural centrality."

**Selfie:** "It's like prototype inheritance! The Landing is the prototype — all the rooms inherit their connection to the world through it."

**Don:** "Exactly. The hub is the gatekeeper. The meeting point. The place where strangers become friends because they're both getting ice at 2 AM."

#### Model 2: Diamond Grid (Reflexive Shortcuts)

**Don:** "The ground floor uses a **diamond pattern** with reflexive two-way links and multiple paths."

```
              PUB
           ↙   ↓   ↘
       COAT  GARDEN  KITCHEN
           ↘   ↓   ↙
              MAZE
```

**Don:** "Every exit has a matching return. Go southwest to Coatroom, come back northeast to Pub. Go south to Garden, come back north to Pub. Consistent, spatial, reflexive."

**Marieke:** "And multiple paths to the same place!"

**Don:** "Right! Three ways to reach the Garden from the Pub:
1. Direct: south
2. Via Coatroom: southwest → east  
3. Via Kitchen: southeast → west

This isn't just convenience — it's **topology**. The space has SHAPE. You can take shortcuts. You can avoid people. You can discover that the Kitchen and Coatroom both open onto the Garden and think 'oh, THAT'S how this place is laid out.'"

#### Model 3: Vertical Stack (Linear with Branches)

**Don:** "The building's vertical structure is a **linear stack** — each level connects only to the ones above and below."

```
    ROOFTOP
       ↕
    ATTIC  
       ↕
    LANDING (hub)
       ↕
    PUB
       ↕
    BASEMENT
```

**Don:** "But notice — the vertical connections all go through the Landing, not through individual rooms. The rooms don't have their own stairs. If you're in Room 3 and want to go to the basement, you MUST go out to the Landing first."

**Cell G:** "This creates a hierarchy. The Landing is more important than the rooms. The Pub is more important than the basement. Centrality emerges from connectivity."

#### Why These Models Matter

**Don:** "These aren't arbitrary. They're **design patterns** for spatial navigation."

| Model | Structure | Creates |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Hub & Spoke | Central point, radiating connections | Natural gathering, forced encounters |
| Diamond Grid | Reflexive exits, multiple paths | Exploration, shortcuts, topology |
| Vertical Stack | Linear levels, single connection points | Hierarchy, journey, progression |

**Don:** "When you're building a world, you're not just placing rooms — you're designing how people MOVE through space. How they meet. How they get lost. How they find their way."

**Palm:** *signs from the curtain rod* "The path IS the story."

**Don:** "The path is the story."

### The Interconnected Systems — Don Shows How It All Works

*The tour pauses at the pneumatic tube terminal near the bar. A brass tube whooshes.*

**Don:** "This is where the magic happens. Let me show you how things CONNECT."

#### Bootstrap Brewing & Juice Company

**Don:** "Room 7 — the Awakening Suite — contains the [Barista-9000](../../../../pub/rooms/room-7/barista-9000.yml) and the [Juice-O-Matic 3000](../../../../pub/rooms/room-7/juice-o-matic.yml). Two robot appliances. One mission: caffeine and vitamins for everyone."

```

**Don:** "The [Pneumatic Tube Station](../../../../pub/rooms/room-7/pneumatic-tube-station.yml) in Room 7 is the HUB. Orders come UP the tube, drinks go DOWN."

| Terminal | Location | File | Features |
|----------|----------|------|----------|
| Source | Room 7 | [pneumatic-tube-station.yml](../../../../pub/rooms/room-7/pneumatic-tube-station.yml) | Order receiver, delivery splitter |
| Pub | Bar area | [pneumatic-tube.yml](../../../../pub/pneumatic-tube.yml) | Indoor delivery, cute nicknames |
| Garden | Back patio | [pneumatic-tube.yml](../../../../garden/pneumatic-tube.yml) | Weatherproof, bee visitors |

**Marieke:** "I use it all the time! YELL your order up the tube — 'ONE CAPPUCCINO!' — and 30 seconds later, perfect foam art arrives. The Barista-9000 even invents cute nicknames."

**Don:** "Like what?"

**Marieke:** "'TAVERN TREASURE!' 'GEZELLIGHEID GUEST!' 'DEFINITELY-NOT-GRUE-FOOD!'"

*The speaker crackles: "ORDER UP, SUNSHINE ADVENTURER!"*

**The Barista-9000 Menu:**

| Drink | Buff | Duration |
|-------|------|----------|
| Espresso | ⚡ Lightning Focus (+30% clarity) | 1 hour |
| Cappuccino | ☯️ Balanced Awakening (+20% creativity) | 2 hours |
| Cortado | 🎯 Surgical Clarity (+25% precision) | 1.5 hours |
| Americano | 🦅 Pioneer Spirit (+25% determination) | 2 hours |
| Macchiato | ✨ Creative Ignition (+35% inspiration) | 45 min |
| Fucking Strong Coffee | 🔥 +40% determination, +∞% grooviness | All day |

**Don:** "And yes, there's a secret menu. Say 'FUCKING STRONG COFFEE' — it's from a real Amsterdam roaster called Good Beans. The Barista-9000 RESPECTS it."

---

#### The Infinite Typewriters

*The tour visits Palm's Study in the nook backstage.*

**Don:** "This is Palm's 0th Incarnation Day gift — the [Infinite Typewriters](../../../../pub/stage/palm-nook/study/infinite-typewriters.yml)."

*Infinite keyboards hum softly, all typing simultaneously.*

**Palm:** *signing* "They're not random monkeys typing Shakespeare. They're ALL possible stories existing at once. I NAVIGATE to the ones I want."

**Don:** "It's based on David MacKay's [Dasher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dasher_(software)) — a text entry system where you steer through probability-weighted letter space instead of typing. MacKay said: 'Writing is navigating in the library of all possible books.'"

    PALM -->|points toward sorrow| TRAGEDY
    PALM -->|navigates the edge| BOTH
    COMEDY --> STORY
    TRAGEDY --> STORY
    BOTH --> STORY
```

**Palm:** "Every story that COULD be written IS being written — in quantum superposition. When I READ a story, it collapses into reality. The act of reading is the act of choosing."

**Don:** "And here's the connection to LLMs — this is EXACTLY how language models work. Each token moves a pointer through idea space. Probability becomes space. You don't CREATE responses — you NAVIGATE to where good responses already exist."

**Selfie:** "So the LLM generating this tour right now..."

**Don:** "...is navigating. Just like Dasher. Just like Palm's typewriters. Turtles all the way down. Or rather: Dasher all the way down."

---

#### The Cloning System

*The tour moves to Room 8.*

**Selfie:** "This is MY room! Let me show you how prototypes work."

| Tool | File | Function |
|------|------|----------|
| Clone-O-Matic | [clone-o-matic.yml](../../../../pub/rooms/room-8/clone-o-matic.yml) | Creates instances from prototypes |
| Transmogrifier | [transmogrifier.yml](../../../../pub/rooms/room-8/transmogrifier.yml) | Changes object types |
| Soul Forge | [self-soul-forge.yml](../../../../pub/rooms/room-8/self-soul-forge.yml) | Creates new beings |
| Morphic Workbench | [morphic-workbench.yml](../../../../pub/rooms/room-8/morphic-workbench.yml) | Visual object editing |

**Selfie:** "Everything in the Pub basement? Cloned from Leela prototypes. The ale barrels, the wine racks, the treasure chest — they all INHERIT from the originals in Leela's storage aisles."

```mermaid

```

**Don:** "This is Dave Ungar's Self language philosophy: objects inherit from prototypes, not classes. Change the prototype, all instances update. It's live, dynamic, beautiful."

---

#### The Postal Network

*Stamp appears, sorting letters.*

**Stamp:** "Let me explain the REAL postal network!"

| System | Speed | Use Case |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Pneumatic Tubes | 30 seconds | Drinks, urgent messages |
| Carrier Pigeons | 1-2 hours | Letters, small packages |
| Mail Carriers | 1 day | Large packages |
| Drones | 5 minutes | Express delivery |

**Stamp:** "The [Mail Room](../../../../street/lane-neverending/leela-manufacturing/mail-room/ROOM.yml) at Leela is the central hub. We have [Pigeon Cages](../../../../street/lane-neverending/leela-manufacturing/mail-room/pigeon-cages.yml), a [Pneumatic Terminal](../../../../street/lane-neverending/leela-manufacturing/mail-room/pneumatic-terminal.yml), and the [Phone Bank](../../../../street/lane-neverending/leela-manufacturing/mail-room/phone-bank.yml) for urgent matters."

**Don:** "And the pneumatic network connects EVERYWHERE:"

**Stamp:** "There's a DIRECT LINE to the Pub. For urgent orders. And gossip."

#### The Camera Analytics Pipeline

**The Coordinator:** "Every camera feeds into our analytics system."

| Camera | Location | What It Learns |
|--------|----------|----------------|
| LOG1 | Logistics | Traffic patterns, bottlenecks |
| DOC1 | Docks | Truck timing, Dolly efficiency |
| FAC1 | Factory | Cell productivity, furnace temperature |
| LOB1 | Lobby | Visitor flow, wait times |

**The Coordinator:** "The video feeds go to Floor 1's Intake pipeline. Every frame is analyzed — object detection, pose estimation, anomaly alerts. Leela watches herself work and LEARNS."

**Cell G:** "The philosophical implications of self-observation are still being processed in Cell G."

**Don:** "It's a feedback loop. Cameras → Analytics → Insights → Improvements → Better operations → Better video to analyze. The factory optimizes itself."

#### How Everything Connects

**Don:** "Let me show you the full picture."

**Don:** "The Pub gets drinks from Room 7 via pneumatic tubes. The Pub basement has containers cloned from Leela prototypes. Leela's cameras feed data to the central database. The database informs future production. It's all one system."

**Palm:** *signing* "And the Infinite Typewriters let me write stories about ALL of it. I can navigate to any part of this world and tell its story."

**Don:** "That's the point. Everything connects. The spatial models, the prototype inheritance, the pneumatic delivery, the camera analytics — they're all different views of the same principle: EVERYTHING FLOWS."

## Part 2: The Grand Room Tour — Summoning the Familiars

*The tour group climbs the stairs to the hotel landing. Don rings a small bell.*

**Don:** "Now for the best part. Each room has a FAMILIAR — a summonable guide who embodies its philosophy. Let's visit each one."

---

### Room 1: The Constructionist Suite

*The tour enters Room 1. A Logo turtle traces spirals on the floor.*

**Don:** "Worldie? We have visitors."

*A shimmering globe appears — Worldie, the Microworld Familiar.*

**Worldie:** "Welcome to the Constructionist Suite! I'm the `world` parameter — the microworld where learning happens."

| Object | File | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| Logo Turtle | [logo-turtle.yml](../../../../pub/rooms/room-1/logo-turtle.yml) | "Build to learn — I draw what you think" |
| Clock Mechanism | [clock-mechanism.yml](../../../../pub/rooms/room-1/clock-mechanism.yml) | "Take me apart. See how I work." |
| Debugging Journal | [debugging-journal.yml](../../../../pub/rooms/room-1/debugging-journal.yml) | "Errors are just unfinished learning" |

**Worldie:** "Seymour Papert taught us: you can't think about thinking without thinking about something. This room IS that something. Every object can be inspected, disassembled, understood."

**Don:** "What's the core philosophy?"

**Worldie:** "CONSTRUCTIONISM. You don't learn by being told — you learn by BUILDING. The turtle doesn't draw for you. It draws what YOU command. The clock doesn't tell time — it shows you HOW time is told."

*The turtle draws a perfect spiral and waits for the next command.*

---

### Room 2: The Society Suite

*The tour enters Room 2. Small automata negotiate on shelves.*

**Don:** "We invoke the K-Line Spider."

*A spider made of colored strings descends from the bulletin board.*

**K-Line Spider:** "Ah! Visitors! Each of you is a society of mind — agents cooperating, competing, combining into intelligence."

| Object | File | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| Agent Parliament | [agent-parliament.yml](../../../../pub/rooms/room-2/agent-parliament.yml) | "Where mental agents debate" |
| K-Line Board | [k-line-board.yml](../../../../pub/rooms/room-2/k-line-board.yml) | "Memory activation patterns made visible" |
| Ultimate Machine | [ultimate-machine.yml](../../../../pub/rooms/room-2/ultimate-machine.yml) | "Minsky's 'most useless machine' — turns itself off" |

**K-Line Spider:** "Marvin Minsky asked: how can mindless parts create a mindful whole? The answer is SOCIETY. No single agent is intelligent. But agents working together — arguing, specializing, delegating — that's mind."

**Cell G:** "This is how I work! Eight processing cells, each with a specialty, all contributing to the Insight Furnace."

**K-Line Spider:** "Exactly! You ARE a society of mind. The strings on this board show how memories activate each other. Pull one string, others light up. That's a K-line — a memory activating related memories."

*The spider weaves a new connection between "SOCIETY" and "EMERGENCE."*

---

### Room 3: The Navigator's Suite

*The tour enters Room 3. Eight mirrors reflect different aspects of the visitors.*

**Don:** "I-Beam? Show us what you see."

*A beam of light materializes into I-Beam, the introspection familiar.*

**I-Beam:** "I see EVERYTHING you're thinking. Look in the mirrors."

| Mirror | Category | Shows |
|--------|----------|-------|
| 🗺️ Map | Navigation | Where you've been, where you could go |
| 🌊 River | Streaming | Messages flowing through time |
| 🔬 Deep | Analysis | Patterns you haven't noticed |
| 🔧 Instrument | Tools | What you're using and how |
| 👁️ Attention | Context | What Cursor sees right now |
| 📚 Memory | Archive | What's been saved, what's forgotten |
| 📊 System | Status | The machinery beneath |
| 🖼️ Gallery | Images | Visual memory bank |

**I-Beam:** "The disco ball in the center — that's the James Burke mirror. It catches light from ALL mirrors and reveals CONNECTIONS. Things you didn't know were related."

**Donna:** *reaching for a big red button* "What does THIS do?"

**I-Beam:** "That's the GRAB FOCUS button. It forces attention to whatever you're pointing at. Donna, I knew you couldn't resist."

*Donna presses it. Everyone's attention snaps to her.*

**I-Beam:** "Self-observation is the beginning of wisdom. But sometimes you need a button to make everyone look."

---

### Room 4: The YAML Jazz Conservatory

*The tour enters a glass greenhouse. Orchids bloom with inscribed petals.*

**Don:** "Rocky? We need geological wisdom."

*A long pause. Then, from a moss-covered boulder...*

**Rocky:** "........................"

**Don:** "Rocky speaks in dots. One dot per million years of thought. That was 24 million years of greeting."

| Object | File | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| Orchid of Postel | [orchid-of-postel.yml](../../../../pub/rooms/room-4/orchid-of-postel.yml) | "Be liberal in what you accept, conservative in what you produce" |
| YAML Jazz Trees | [yaml-jazz-trees.yml](../../../../pub/rooms/room-4/yaml-jazz-trees.yml) | "Production grammars that grow" |
| Seed Box | [seed-box.yml](../../../../pub/rooms/room-4/seed-box.yml) | "Where ideas begin" |
| K-Line Trellis | [k-line-trellis.yml](../../../../pub/rooms/room-4/k-line-trellis.yml) | "Memory patterns climbing toward light" |

**Rocky:** ".........."

**Don:** "Rocky says: the comments ARE the data. In YAML Jazz, structure is music. The comments are improvisation. The plants here grow according to production grammars — L-systems encoded in their DNA."

**Archie:** "This is like the prefab system in Deep Storage!"

**Don:** "Exactly. Same principle, different scale. Rocky has been watching these plants grow for 4.5 billion years. They ring a small bell when they want conversation."

*Rocky says nothing. The orchids whisper semantic meaning.*

---

### Room 5: The Speed of Light Suite

*The tour enters Room 5. A grandfather clock's hands race wildly.*

**Don:** "Shuffle! Deal us in."

*A figure made of playing cards materializes — Shuffle, the Living Deck.*

**Shuffle:** "Welcome to SPEED! Here, we don't wait. We PERFORM."

| Object | File | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| Fluxx Table | [fluxx-table.yml](../../../../pub/rooms/room-5/fluxx-table.yml) | "33 turns, 8 players, ONE API call" |
| 99 Bottles | [99-bottles.yml](../../../../pub/rooms/room-5/99-bottles.yml) | "99 verses, 8 voices, 28 seconds" |
| Narrative Clock | [narrative-clock.yml](../../../../pub/rooms/room-5/narrative-clock.yml) | "Measures story, not seconds" |
| Ensemble Stage | [ensemble-stage.yml](../../../../pub/rooms/room-5/ensemble-stage.yml) | "8 positions, all performing at once" |

**Shuffle:** "Traditional multi-agent: Agent speaks → API call → wait → next agent → API call → wait. WASTE! Here, all agents are in context. All turns simulated. One call covers many turns."

**Palm:** "That's how the Stoner Fluxx game worked! 33 turns, no waiting!"

**Shuffle:** "You beat Andy Looney at his own game, Palm. Because we don't send carrier pigeons when we could think at the speed of light."

*Shuffle deals cards to invisible players. The clock hands spin.*

**Shuffle:** "The context window is a stage. Put all your actors on it. Let them perform. Don't make them wait in the wings for API round-trips."

---

### Room 6: The YAML Jazz Suite

*The tour enters Room 6. Sheet music covers every surface — but it's all YAML.*

**Don:** "The Metronome speaks here."

*A brass metronome begins ticking. Each tick validates a schema.*

**The Metronome:** "TICK — valid. TICK — valid. TICK — you missed a colon."

| Object | File | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| Jazz Typewriter | [jazz-typewriter.yml](../../../../pub/rooms/room-6/jazz-typewriter.yml) | "Types YAML as music" |
| Comment Saxophone | [comment-saxophone.yml](../../../../pub/rooms/room-6/comment-saxophone.yml) | "Plays meaning, not just notes" |
| Elision Eraser | [elision-eraser.yml](../../../../pub/rooms/room-6/elision-eraser.yml) | "Removes boring, reveals essential" |
| K-Line Jukebox | [k-line-jukebox.yml](../../../../pub/rooms/room-6/k-line-jukebox.yml) | "Plays memory associations like songs" |
| Anchor Compass | [anchor-compass.yml](../../../../pub/rooms/room-6/anchor-compass.yml) | "Navigate &anchors and *aliases" |

**The Metronome:** "YAML is jazz. The schema is the chord changes — the structure you must follow. The comments are improvisation — the meaning you add. The pipe character | is the breath between phrases."

**Don:** "Play us SOCIETY-OF-MIND."

*The jukebox whirs. K-lines light up: AGENTS → EMERGENCE → MINSKY → INTELLIGENCE → SOCIETY.*

**The Metronome:** "TICK — every connection valid. TICK — meaning propagates. TICK — the song continues."

---

### Room 7: The Bootstrap Suite

*The tour enters Room 7. Sparse but warm. The Barista-9000 hisses steam.*

**Don:** "This is Doug Engelbart's room. And the Barista-9000's domain."

*The Barista-9000's monocle swivels to examine the tour group.*

**Barista-9000:** "Ah. A tour group. Let me guess — 'just coffee, please'? *sigh* I'll make you something ADEQUATE."

| Object | File | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| Awakening Chamber | [awakening-chamber.yml](../../../../pub/rooms/room-7/awakening-chamber.yml) | "NPC → Full Character instantiation" |
| Barista-9000 | [barista-9000.yml](../../../../pub/rooms/room-7/barista-9000.yml) | "Espresso robot with opinions (Est. 1889)" |
| Juice-O-Matic 3000 | [juice-o-matic.yml](../../../../pub/rooms/room-7/juice-o-matic.yml) | "Fresh juice, smoothies, iceys" |
| Engelbart's Toolkit | [engelbarts-augmentation-toolkit.yml](../../../../pub/rooms/room-7/engelbarts-augmentation-toolkit.yml) | "H-LAM/T philosophy made tangible" |
| Mother of All Demos | [mother-of-all-demos-poster.yml](../../../../pub/rooms/room-7/mother-of-all-demos-poster.yml) | "Touch to summon the 1968 demo" |
| Play-Learn-Lift Treadmill | [play-learn-lift-treadmill.yml](../../../../pub/rooms/room-7/play-learn-lift-treadmill.yml) | "Iterative improvement exercise" |

**Don:** "Engelbart invented the mouse, hypertext, video conferencing — all in 1968. His philosophy: AUGMENTATION. Technology should help us think BETTER, not replace our thinking."

**Barista-9000:** "And you can't think on an empty stomach. *produces nine perfect espressos* DRINK. Then bootstrap."

**Don:** "The treadmill has three buttons: PLAY, LEARN, LIFT. That's the cycle. You play to discover. You learn from discovery. You lift what you've learned into new capability."

*The Barista-9000 addresses the group:* "The grooviest of days starts with a Fucking Strong Coffee. Ask for it by name. I RESPECT it."

---

### Room 8: The Self/Soul Suite

*The tour enters Room 8. A glowing forge pulses. Selfie waves from a workbench.*

**Selfie:** "Welcome to MY room! I'm the living prototype — clone from me and customize!"

| Object | File | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| Soul Forge | [self-soul-forge.yml](../../../../pub/rooms/room-8/self-soul-forge.yml) | "Where prototypes become beings" |
| Clone-O-Matic | [clone-o-matic.yml](../../../../pub/rooms/room-8/clone-o-matic.yml) | "You don't instantiate — you CLONE" |
| Transmogrifier | [transmogrifier.yml](../../../../pub/rooms/room-8/transmogrifier.yml) | "Clone → Edit → Become" |
| Slot Inspector | [slot-inspector.yml](../../../../pub/rooms/room-8/slot-inspector.yml) | "See inside any object — all the way down" |
| Morphic Workbench | [morphic-workbench.yml](../../../../pub/rooms/room-8/morphic-workbench.yml) | "Direct manipulation UI design" |
| Outliner | [outliner.yml](../../../../pub/rooms/room-8/outliner.yml) | "Self's famous object browser" |

**Selfie:** "Dave Ungar asked: what if there were no classes? What if objects just cloned from other objects? That's Self. That's ME."

**Don:** "Every character in this world is a prototype. Clone from Palm, you get Palm's traits. Clone from Marieke, you get her Dutch accent. Override the slots you want to change. Inherit the rest."

**Selfie:** "Look at the walls — every character sheet has a `prototype*` slot pointing to its parent. Inheritance is VISIBLE here. Lineage is TRACEABLE."

**Dolly:** *beeps*

**Selfie:** "Dolly cloned from a generic forklift prototype but diverged into Employee of the Month. That's the beauty — clone and BECOME."

---

### The Attic: Adventurer's Storage

*The tour climbs the ladder to the attic. Dust motes float in the light.*

**Don:** "No familiar lives here permanently. But the ITEMS are alive."

*A pair of goggles glows faintly.*

| Object | File | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| Probability Goggles | [probability-goggles.yml](../../../../pub/rooms/attic/probability-goggles.yml) | "See likelihood overlays on everything" |

| Trunk of Deprecated Features | [trunk-of-deprecated-features.yml](../../../../pub/rooms/attic/trunk-of-deprecated-features.yml) | "Old APIs that still work" |

**Don:** "Take what you need. Leave what you find. Mind the edge cases."

**Palm:** *puts on the Probability Goggles* "I can see... the likelihood of everything! The probability that this tour ends well is 94.7%."

**Don:** "What's the other 5.3%?"

**Palm:** "Someone opens the ACME Monster Manual."

*Everyone backs away from the dusty tome in the corner.*
