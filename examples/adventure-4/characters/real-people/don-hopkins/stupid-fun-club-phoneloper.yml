# THE TOOL
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

the_tool:

  name: "Phoneloper"
  created: "~2003"
  context: "Stupid Fun Club robot speech research"
  
  technology:
    language: "Python"
    gui: "Tkinter"
    synthesizer: "CMU Flite (modified)"
    
  what_it_does: |
    A toy/tool for creating and editing expressive speech "Phonelopes."
    
    Don modified CMU's "Flite" open source speech synthesizer so it could
    export and import diphone/pitch/timing as XML "Phonelopes."
    
    You could:
    - Synthesize a sentence to get initial stream of diphones + pitch envelope
    - Edit by selecting and dragging diphones around
    - Add and delete control points from pitch and amplitude tracks
    - Stretch diphones to change duration
    - "Phonoscope" - load audio file, draw spectrogram, match timing to it

    title: "Phoneloper Demo"
    date: "2021-05-29"
    description: |
      Don's demonstration of the Phoneloper tool showing:
      - Diphone editing (hello world)
      - Pitch envelope manipulation
      - Granular synthesis effects (hold spacebar)
      - Phonoscoping a Herbie Hancock lick
      - Real-time pitch manipulation
      - "Drunk" button and speed controls
      - Various expressive test phrases ("dude", "shit", "meow")
      - Template insertion
      - Crowd/chorus effects
      
  key_concepts:
  
    diphones: |
      "Diphones" are the sound of going from one phoneme to another.
      The synthesizer uses these as building blocks.
      You can stretch, move, and rearrange them.
      
    pitch_envelope: |
      The pitch track controls intonation.
      Add/remove control points to inflect speech.
      Drag points up/down to change pitch at that moment.
      
    phonoscoping: |
      Like "rotoscoping" but for audio.
      Load a WAV file, see its spectrogram.
      Drag diphones to match the timing.
      Pitch tracker attempts to follow the original.
      
      Not "fully automatic" but manual tool for matching.
      
    granular_synthesis: |
      Hold spacebar to repeat the current segment.
      Creates granular synthesis effects.
      💬 "It's like having this huge chorus of demons." —Don Hopkins
      
    direct_manipulation: |
      REAL-TIME INTERACTION while synthesizing!
      
      Hold spacebar to auto-repeat the play trigger.
      WHILE IT'S PLAYING:
      - Select one or more keypoints on the pitch envelope
      - Drag them UP/DOWN to change pitch
      - Drag them LEFT/RIGHT to change timing
      - The sound changes LIVE as you sculpt it
      
      Two dimensions of expression: PITCH and TIME.
      Both malleable in real-time during playback.
      
      Perform VERBAL GESTURES:
      - Swoop the pitch up for questioning intonation
      - Drag down for commanding/declarative
      - Wiggle for vibrato or uncertainty
      - Stretch diphones while looping for time manipulation
      
      It's a MUSICAL INSTRUMENT for speech.
      Your mouse movements become vocal expression.
      
      💬 "Oh wow it's real time!" —Don Hopkins (surprised by his own tool)
      
  fun_features:
    - "Drunk button (adds variation)"
    - "Speed control"
    - "Multiple drunk levels"
    - "Template insertion (phrases into other phrases)"
    - "Crowd/chorus generation"
    - "Real-time pitch manipulation"
    - "Goes as low as you want (sub-bass speech)"

      Don't quote me on that but....

# DEEP SCAT — SPEECH SYNTHESIS/RECOGNITION FEEDBACK
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

deep_scat:

  concept: |
    Looping speech synthesizers back into speech recognizers.
    Like audio or video feedback, but with language.
    
  description:
    source: "Don Hopkins, HN comment, April 19, 2016"
    quote: |
      💬 "I played around with looping different speech synthesizers back 
      into different speech recognizers, kind of like audio or video 
      feedback, but with chaotic noise injected like quirks of the 
      synthesizer, the voice, speech speed and pitch, and the audio 
      environment around the microphone (you could talk over it to 
      interfere with the words it was speaking and lay down new words 
      in the loop), working against the lawful pattern matching and 
      error correction behavior of the speech recognizer, and the HMM 
      language model it was trained with." —Don Hopkins
      
  behavior: |
    "It was a lot like beat poetry, in that it tended to rhyme and 
    have the same number of syllables and use plausible sounding 
    sequences of words that didn't actually make any sense, 
    like Sarah Palin."
    
  telephone_game: |
    "You can start it out with a sensible sentence, and it will play 
    the telephone game, distorting it again and again."
    
  speed_effects: |
    "If you slow down the speech rate, words will split into more 
    words or syllables, and if you speed it up, words will collapse 
    into fewer words or syllables."
    
  strange_attractors: |
    "It would wander aimlessly randomly around poetic landscapes, 
    sometimes falling into strange attractors in the speech recognizer's 
    hidden markov model and repeating itself with little or no variation."
    
  interaction: |
    "At any time you can join in with your own voice and add words 
    during the pause at the end of the loop, or talk over its voice, 
    much the way you can hold things in front of the camera during 
    video feedback to mix them in."
    
  psychoanalysis_of_recognizers:
  
    ibm_viavoice:
      trained_on: "Newspaper articles about Watergate hearings"
      personality: "Paranoid, but business-like, as if dictating a memo"
      attractors:
        - "congressional investigation"
        - "burglary and wiretapping"
        - "convicted of conspiracy"
        
    microsoft:
      trained_on: "Newspaper articles about Clinton-Lewinsky scandal"
      personality: "Obsessed with repeatedly chanting about blow jobs"
      behavior: |
        "Whenever you mentioned Clinton this or Clinton that, 
        it would rapidly converge on Clinton Lewinsky, 
        Clinton presidency, Clinton impeachment, etc."

# CHATTERBOTS

chatterbots:

  context: |
    SFC developed chatterbot toys - interactive speech-based toys.
    Multiple versions developed over the years.
    
    🗣️ They were exploring voice assistant feedback loops years before 
    Alexa, Siri, and Google Home existed.

    zen_chatbot:
      also_known_as: "Buddha Chatterbot"
      behavior: "Makes all the other chatterbots keep quiet"
      note: "Says nothing, but influences others"
      philosophy: |
        The bot that speaks by not speaking.
        Its silence creates space for others to stop talking.

        SFC was doing this in 2003 with speech synthesis/recognition.

        it would start chanting phrases like 'congressional investigation,' 
        and 'burglary and wiretapping.'" —Don Hopkins

      💬 "The thing that just occurred to me in this video explaining it 
      is how an AI agent runs in a mutating loop, feedback just like 
      we were doing with Slat's speech synthesizer feeding into its 
      speech recognizers! It would explore the strange attractors of 
      its linguistic training data by generating robot-beat-poetry 
      that surfaced the catch phrases of the time of training." —Don Hopkins

  application:
    quote: |
      💬 "For Leela I'm defining this 'WhyQuest' object that bounces 
      back and forth between the LLM and the user interface, 
      letting each of it mutate and edit and add and elaborate 
      more pieces of evidence and goals and sub-goals and natural 
      language instructions to steer the LLM, which adds feedback 
      to inform the user." —Don Hopkins

    2025: LLM agents - same principle at larger scale
    
    The robots were exploring strange attractors in HMM language models.
    Modern AI explores strange attractors in neural network weights.
    
    Same principle. Different scale.

# THE SPIRIT
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

the_spirit: |
  In 2003, Don made robots speak expressively.
  He fed their words back into their ears.
  They started chanting about Watergate and Lewinsky.
  Beat poetry from training data.
  
  "It was a lot like beat poetry, in that it tended to rhyme 
  and have the same number of syllables and use plausible 
  sounding sequences of words that didn't actually make any sense, 
  like Sarah Palin."
  
  Twenty years later, the same principle scales to LLMs.
  Strange attractors in the weights.
  The feedback loop continues.
  
  The key to AI is synergistic multimedia feedback loops.
  
  Don knew this in 2003.
  He just didn't have the compute.
