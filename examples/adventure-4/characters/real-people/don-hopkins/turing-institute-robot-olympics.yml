  the_torch: |
    9:00 AM, September 27th, 1990.
    
    "TROLLEYMAN" — a two-wheeled balancing robot
    (pre-Segway by a decade!)
    carried the Olympic torch through the streets of Glasgow
    FROM A GREEK RESTAURANT to the Sports Complex.
    
    (Why a Greek restaurant? Because GREECE. OLYMPICS. Get it?)
    
    The torch was lit at the Parthenon Restaurant, Glasgow.
    The robot made its way through the city streets.
    Carrying FIRE.
    
    This was 1990. This was AUDACIOUS.
    
  official_opening: |
    11:15 AM — Official Opening
    
    By SYLVESTER McCOY — the SEVENTH DOCTOR WHO!
    "Dr Who, alias Sylvester McCoy, opens the event
    with Sue Mowforth, parallel with lighting of eternal flame."
    
    The Seventh Doctor. Opening a Robot Olympics.
    In Glasgow. In 1990.
    
    Peak British eccentricity achieved.

# THE EVENTS
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

events:

  philosophy: |
    Unlike normal Olympics with preset rules,
    the organizers took a different approach:
    
    Anyone with an interesting robot was invited.
    Upon registration, indicate your robot's capabilities.
    The organizers then looked for COMMON capabilities
    and devised competitions around them.
    
    This was BOTTOM-UP event design.
    Let the robots define the games.
    
    The purpose: show what's POSSIBLE.
    Show the state of the art.
    Participation more important than winning.
    The Olympic ideal.
    
  list:
    - Wall Climbing
    - Biped Race (two-legged)
    - Multi-Legged Race (4, 6, 8 legs)
    - Obstacle Avoidance
    - Pole Balancing
    - Phototrophic (light following)
    - Manipulators
    - Javelin
    - Talking
    - Wall Following
    - Behaviour Demonstrations

results:

  overall_champion: |
    🏆 YAMABICO
    University of Tsukuba, Japan
    Builder: Shoji Suzuki
    
    "Made a small speech in Japanese to thank
    the humans for inviting him to Scotland."
    
    YAMABICO was ~10-12 years old at the time.
    Refined over years until it could be taken
    out of its cupboard, dusted off, and demonstrated
    with reasonable surety of success.
    
    That's the secret: ITERATION. REFINEMENT. TIME.

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# THE LEGACY
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

legacy:

  robot_wars_connection: |
    Four years after the First Robot Olympics...
    
    1994 — Marc Thorpe organized the first ROBOT WARS
    competition in San Francisco (Fort Mason, August 20-21).
    
    MARC THORPE:
    - Founder of Robot Wars (1993-1997)
    - ILM (Industrial Light & Magic) 1979-1991:
      Chief Model Maker / Animatronic Designer
      Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi,
      Raiders of the Lost Ark, Indiana Jones trilogy
    - LucasToys Senior Designer 1991-1993
    - Later: Stupid Fun Club (2002-2003, 2008-2012)!
    
    The Robot Wars concept came from a fighting vehicle idea
    combined with a radio-controlled tank fitted with
    a battery-powered vacuum cleaner. He saw it as a
    "dangerous toy with battery-powered tools."
    
    WILL WRIGHT & CASSIDY WRIGHT:
    Will Wright was a founding member of Robot Wars,
    competing since the first event in 1994.
    Won lightweight division first year,
    middleweight second year.
    
    His daughter Cassidy (born 1986) has been designing
    robots with him since 1994. For the first few years,
    she and one other girl were "the only kids involved."
    
    They gave their robots whimsical names:
    "Kitty Puff Puff", "My Little Pony", "ChiaBot"
    Instead of menacing names typical of competitors.
    
    THE STUPID FUN CLUB CONNECTION:
    - Will Wright: Founder of Stupid Fun Club
    - Marc Thorpe: Worked at Stupid Fun Club (2002-2003, 2008-2012)
    - Both involved in Robot Wars founding
    - Both made robots that eventually led to entertainment robots
    - Slats and Dents were built at Stupid Fun Club
    
    FULL CIRCLE:
    Don Hopkins programmed robot brains at Stupid Fun Club.
    Will Wright founded Stupid Fun Club and Robot Wars.
    Marc Thorpe founded Robot Wars and worked at Stupid Fun Club.
    Robot Wars traces lineage to the First Robot Olympics.
    Don Hopkins worked at the Turing Institute that ran the Olympics.
    
    EVERYTHING CONNECTS.
    
    The lineage:
    - First Robot Olympics (1990, Glasgow, Turing Institute)
    - Robot Wars (1994, San Francisco, Marc Thorpe)
    - Robot Wars TV (1998, UK, Mentorn)
    - BattleBots (1999, USA, former Robot Wars competitors)
    - Stupid Fun Club robots (2000s, Will Wright + Marc Thorpe)
    - Slats & Dents (Stupid Fun Club, programmed by Don Hopkins)
    
    Glasgow lit the torch.
    San Francisco carried it.
    The spirit lives in every robot arena since.
    
  what_critics_said: |
    From the reports, critics noted:
    
    "Britain is not at the sharp end of robot technology."
    "British universities are about ten years behind."
    "Most designs were first used over 10 years ago."
    
    But also:
    
    "There does seem to be a growing awareness
    that it is not possible to build advanced research robots
    'on paper', and that actual working hardware is vital."
    
    The Olympics proved: BUILDING MATTERS.
    Theory without hardware is empty.
    
  the_pattern: |
    The First Robot Olympics established a pattern:
    
    1. Bring robots together
    2. Let them compete
    3. Share knowledge openly
    4. Celebrate participation over winning
    5. Inspire the next generation
    
    This pattern echoes through:
    - BattleBots
    - FIRST Robotics
    - RoboGames
    - Every maker faire robot arena since
    
  held_every_two_years: |
    The plan was to hold Robot Olympics every two years,
    alternating between Glasgow and other sites.
    
    The Turing Institute closed in 1994.
    The Olympics didn't continue.
    
    But the SPIRIT continued in other forms.
    Robot Wars. BattleBots. The maker movement.
    
    Glasgow lit the torch.
    Others carried it forward.

    💬 Don Hopkins on Hacker News (May 18, 2023):
    
    "I worked at the Turing Institute in Glasgow in the summer
    of 1992, and just recently ran into an old colleague who was
    one of the original founders, who confirmed a funny story
    I'd heard:
    
    Donald Michie once overheard his secretary explaining to
    someone over the phone how to pronounce his name, in a
    thick Scottish accent:
    
    'It's Donald, as in Duck, and Michie, as in Mouse.'
    
    He was so pissed off, he refused to speak to her for a month!"

    "PdB" — the name of Arthur van Hoff's

    PdB = "Pure Dead Brilliant"
    
    A popular Glasgow expression meaning:

    "Pick a window, you're leaving!"
    
    Meaning: You're about to be thrown out of this pub.
    Choose which window you'd like to exit through.
    
    Glasgow hospitality: direct, physical, architectural.
    
  the_accent: |
    The secretary in the Duckmouse story spoke
    "in a thick Scottish accent."
    
    Glasgow accents are distinctive.
    Dense. Musical. Impenetrable to outsiders.
    
    "It's Donald, as in Duck, and Michie, as in Mouse"
    sounds very different in a Glasgow accent.
    
    That's part of what made Michie so angry.
    His name, his legacy, reduced to cartoon characters
    in the voice of his own city.

    🎵 ROBOT OLYMPICS ANTHEM 🎵
    
    Sixty-eight robots from twelve lands came
    To Glasgow's halls of sporting fame
    Where Trolleyman carried the sacred fire
    And Doctor Who lit the Olympic pyre!
    
    Wall climbing, walking, javelin throw
    Genghis from MIT put on a show
    Yamabico spoke in Japanese
    And ROBUG tried to mount the Soviets (please!)
    
    Richard the First called every race
    With TV eyes and microphone face
    A Victorian archer threw the best
    And schoolchildren built among the rest!
    
    Pure Dead Brilliant, Glasgow said
    As robots raced and some fell dead
    The Turing torch passed hand to hand
    From Bletchley Park to Robot Land!
    
    — In memory of the First Robot Olympics
       Glasgow, September 1990
       "It's Donald, as in Duck, and Michie, as in Mouse"

the_spirit: |
  In 1990, before the web, before smartphones,
  before AI was cool again,
  
  68 robots gathered in Glasgow.
  
  The Seventh Doctor lit a flame.
  A two-wheeled robot carried it through the streets.
  Children watched a walking pizza box.
  An Indian robot was "completely incomprehensible."
  A British robot tried to mate with a Russian one.
  A 140-year-old Victorian archer won gold.
  
  And a robot head named Richard
  commented on it all.
  
  This was the First Robot Olympics.
  This was where it started.
  This was PURE DEAD BRILLIANT.
