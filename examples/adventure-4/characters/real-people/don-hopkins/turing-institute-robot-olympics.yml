  the_torch: |
    9:00 AM, September 27th, 1990.
    
    "TROLLEYMAN" — a two-wheeled balancing robot
    (pre-Segway by a decade!)
    carried the Olympic torch through the streets of Glasgow
    FROM A GREEK RESTAURANT to the Sports Complex.
    
    (Why a Greek restaurant? Because GREECE. OLYMPICS. Get it?)
    
    The torch was lit at the Parthenon Restaurant, Glasgow.
    The robot made its way through the city streets.
    Carrying FIRE.
    
    This was 1990. This was AUDACIOUS.
    
  official_opening: |
    11:15 AM — Official Opening
    
    By SYLVESTER McCOY — the SEVENTH DOCTOR WHO!
    "Dr Who, alias Sylvester McCoy, opens the event
    with Sue Mowforth, parallel with lighting of eternal flame."
    
    The Seventh Doctor. Opening a Robot Olympics.
    In Glasgow. In 1990.
    
    Peak British eccentricity achieved.

# THE EVENTS

events:

  philosophy: |
    Unlike normal Olympics with preset rules,
    the organizers took a different approach:
    
    Anyone with an interesting robot was invited.
    Upon registration, indicate your robot's capabilities.
    The organizers then looked for COMMON capabilities
    and devised competitions around them.
    
    This was BOTTOM-UP event design.
    Let the robots define the games.
    
    The purpose: show what's POSSIBLE.
    Show the state of the art.
    Participation more important than winning.
    The Olympic ideal.
    
  list:
    - Wall Climbing
    - Biped Race (two-legged)
    - Multi-Legged Race (4, 6, 8 legs)
    - Obstacle Avoidance
    - Pole Balancing
    - Phototrophic (light following)
    - Manipulators
    - Javelin
    - Talking
    - Wall Following
    - Behaviour Demonstrations

# THE RESULTS

results:

  overall_champion: |
    🏆 YAMABICO
    University of Tsukuba, Japan
    Builder: Shoji Suzuki
    
    "Made a small speech in Japanese to thank
    the humans for inviting him to Scotland."
    
    YAMABICO was ~10-12 years old at the time.
    Refined over years until it could be taken
    out of its cupboard, dusted off, and demonstrated
    with reasonable surety of success.
    
    That's the secret: ITERATION. REFINEMENT. TIME.

    research_context: |
      End product of a 3-year PhD research project investigating
      alternative forms of robot locomotion.
      
      Walking machines have advantages over wheeled/tracked:
      - Reduced energy consumption over rough ground
      - Ability to contend with difficult obstacles
      - Greater autonomy in hazardous environments
      
      Applications: forestry, agriculture, fire fighting, surveillance
      
      💬 "The biped configuration in particular lends itself readily
      to mobile applications, calling for direct replacement of man
      by machine with the minimum of peripheral adaptation."
      
    gold_medal_performance: |
      💬 From Daily Telegraph (Christine McGourty):
      "The world's fastest two-legged robot took a gold medal
      yesterday at the First International Robot Olympics in
      Glasgow after covering the three-metre course in less
      than a minute."
      
      💬 Paul Channon: "It might be possible to match human speed
      within 10 years. The technology is almost there."
      
      (Note: 36 years later, Boston Dynamics would prove him right.)

    components: "One photocell, one transistor, one relay — ONLY"
    cost: "Under thirty pounds"
    result: "GOLD medal (Phototrophic)"  # Corrected from Shadow Group report
    note: |
      Built in 1990 from a 1962 design.
      Brain = photocell + transistor + relay.
      NOTHING else.
      
      Won Gold against sophisticated competitors.
      
      💬 Shadow Group Report: "Dave Bisset, from the University of
      Kent, put in two small buggies which won a silver and a gold
      medal. One vehicle Icarus built to a 1963 design by D Buckley
      contained as its brain only a photocell a transistor and a
      relay yet won a Silver medal!"
      
      (Note: Sources vary on medal color and year — the design
      was either 1962 or 1963. Either way: ANCIENT.)
      
      The lesson: Sometimes the simplest designs work best.

# THE LEGACY

legacy:

  robot_wars_connection: |
    Four years after the First Robot Olympics...
    
    1994 — Marc Thorpe organized the first ROBOT WARS
    in San Francisco (Fort Mason, August 20-21).
    
    THE LINEAGE:
    - First Robot Olympics (1990, Glasgow, Turing Institute)
    - Robot Wars (1994, San Francisco, Marc Thorpe)
    - Robot Wars TV (1998, UK)
    - BattleBots (1999, USA)
    - Stupid Fun Club (2000s, Will Wright + Marc Thorpe)
    - Slats & Dents (programmed by Don Hopkins)
    
    FULL CIRCLE:
    Don Hopkins worked at the Turing Institute (1992).
    Later, he programmed robot brains at Stupid Fun Club.
    Marc Thorpe founded Robot Wars, then joined Stupid Fun Club.
    Will Wright competed in Robot Wars, then founded Stupid Fun Club.
    
    Glasgow lit the torch. San Francisco carried it.
    
    See: stupid-fun-club.yml for the full SFC story.
    
  what_critics_said: |
    From the reports, critics noted:
    
    💬 "Britain is not at the sharp end of robot technology."
    💬 "British universities are about ten years behind the wavefront."
    💬 "Most designs were first used over 10 years ago."
    
    THE CARPET PROBLEM (Shadow Group Report):
    
    💬 "The carpet later proved to be exceedingly troublesome to most
    of the robots; the small ones got stuck in the pile, larger ones
    navigating by dead-reckoning can only have been confused by the
    pile-induced drift (much as a rug on a carpet seems to have a mind
    of its own migrating purposely in some inconvenient direction)."
    
    THE TWO ATTITUDES (Shadow Group):
    
    💬 "Half [the teams], in charge of robots which didn't look so much
    designed as assembled in the University workshop from parts chosen
    at random from a machinery catalogue, were apparently bored to death
    by the whole affair. Whilst the others in charge of machines,
    working or not, which they had either built themselves or been closely
    involved in the building of, were enthusiastically demonstrating,
    discussing or repairing them."
    
    THE SECRET (Shadow Group on Yamabico):
    
    💬 "Yamabico won the overall prize for the best robot, it is now about
    ten or twelve years old and was refined over the first half of its life
    until now it can be taken out of its cupboard, dusted off and demonstrated
    with reasonable surety of success."
    
    But also:
    
    💬 "There does seem to be a growing awareness
    that it is not possible to build advanced research robots
    'on paper', and that actual working hardware is vital."
    
    The Olympics proved: BUILDING MATTERS.
    Theory without hardware is empty.
    
  the_pattern: |
    The First Robot Olympics established a pattern:
    
    1. Bring robots together
    2. Let them compete
    3. Share knowledge openly
    4. Celebrate participation over winning
    5. Inspire the next generation
    
    This pattern echoes through:
    - BattleBots
    - FIRST Robotics
    - RoboGames
    - Every maker faire robot arena since
    
  held_every_two_years: |
    The plan was to hold Robot Olympics every two years,
    alternating between Glasgow and other sites.
    
    The Turing Institute closed in 1994.
    The Olympics didn't continue.
    
    But the SPIRIT continued in other forms.
    Robot Wars. BattleBots. The maker movement.

# DON HOPKINS' CONNECTION

  when_he_was_there: |
    Don Hopkins worked at the Turing Institute
    in the summer of 1992 — two years after the Olympics.
    
    But the Olympics were still fresh in memory.
    The robots were still there.
    The stories were still told.

    — Don Hopkins on Richard 1st robot head
    
    The Olympic commentator robot became Don's digital face.
    Thirty years later, still representing.

    💬 Don Hopkins on Hacker News (May 18, 2023):
    
    "I worked at the Turing Institute in Glasgow in the summer
    of 1992, and just recently ran into an old colleague who was
    one of the original founders, who confirmed a funny story
    I'd heard:
    
    Donald Michie once overheard his secretary explaining to
    someone over the phone how to pronounce his name, in a
    thick Scottish accent:
    
    'It's Donald, as in Duck, and Michie, as in Mouse.'
    
    He was so pissed off, he refused to speak to her for a month!"

# GLASGOW CULTURE

glasgow_culture:

  pure_dead_brilliant: |
    "PdB" — the name of Arthur van Hoff's
    C to PostScript compiler at the Turing Institute.
    
    PdB = "Pure Dead Brilliant"
    
    A popular Glasgow expression meaning:
    "Absolutely fantastic." "Totally excellent."
    
    💬 arethuza on HN: "One of my favourite's was the name
    of the C to PostScript compiler PDB - being Glasgow:
    'Pure Dead Brilliant'."
    
    The compiler was used on HyperLook and SimCity.
    A piece of Glasgow slang compiled into history.
    
  pick_a_window: |
    Another Glasgow expression from the era:
    
    "Pick a window, you're leaving!"
    
    Meaning: You're about to be thrown out of this pub.
    Choose which window you'd like to exit through.
    
    Glasgow hospitality: direct, physical, architectural.
    
  the_accent: |
    The secretary in the Duckmouse story spoke
    "in a thick Scottish accent."
    
    Glasgow accents are distinctive.
    Dense. Musical. Impenetrable to outsiders.
    
    "It's Donald, as in Duck, and Michie, as in Mouse"
    sounds very different in a Glasgow accent.
    
    That's part of what made Michie so angry.
    His name, his legacy, reduced to cartoon characters
    in the voice of his own city.

# CELEBRATION

celebration:

  song: |
    🎵 ROBOT OLYMPICS ANTHEM 🎵
    
    Sixty-eight robots from twelve lands came
    To Glasgow's halls of sporting fame
    Where Trolleyman carried the sacred fire
    And Doctor Who lit the Olympic pyre!
    
    Wall climbing, walking, javelin throw
    Genghis from MIT put on a show
    Yamabico spoke in Japanese
    And ROBUG tried to mount the Soviets (please!)
    
    Richard the First called every race
    With TV eyes and microphone face
    A Victorian archer threw the best
    And schoolchildren built among the rest!
    
    Pure Dead Brilliant, Glasgow said
    As robots raced and some fell dead
    The Turing torch passed hand to hand
    From Bletchley Park to Robot Land!
    
    — In memory of the First Robot Olympics
       Glasgow, September 1990
       "It's Donald, as in Duck, and Michie, as in Mouse"

# THE SPIRIT

the_spirit: |
  In 1990, before the web, before smartphones,
  before AI was cool again,
  
  68 robots gathered in Glasgow.
  
  The Seventh Doctor lit a flame.
  A two-wheeled robot carried it through the streets.
  Children watched a walking pizza box.
  An Indian robot was "completely incomprehensible."
  A British robot tried to mate with a Russian one.
  A 140-year-old Victorian archer won gold.
  
  And a robot head named Richard
  commented on it all.
  
  This was the First Robot Olympics.
  This was where it started.
  This was PURE DEAD BRILLIANT.
