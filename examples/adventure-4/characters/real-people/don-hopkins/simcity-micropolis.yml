# THE FIRST ENCOUNTER — Where it all began

first_encounter:
  date: "1989-12-26, 2:37 PM"
  location: "University of Maryland"
  what_happened: |
    Played SimCity for the first time on a Mac. 
    Posted to comp.theory.cellular-automata that same day.

      I just got a chance to play SimCity! It's like a drawing program that
      lets you build cities, by zoning districts, putting down power plants
      and football stadiums, wiring up the power grid, laying down roads and
      railroads. The simulation is actually running *while* you're
      constructing it! It acts like cellular automita with very high level
      rules -- it keeps track of each cell's population, land value,
      pollution, and many other factors, and the rules that govern how the
      zones develop are based on the state of neighboring zones, and other
      global factors (tax rate, etc). Districts that you've zoned don't come
      online and start developing until they're hooked into the power grid,
      by being connected through power line cells or adjacent buildings.
      Buildings seem to "feed" off of people brought in by roads and
      railroads. Residential zones in busy districts grow into high-rise
      apartment buildings. Traffic patterns develop on the roads, and you
      can see little cars zooming around based on the population of the
      area, and the flow of the roads! Once you build an airport, a
      helicoptor flies around the city and reports on heavy traffic,
      encouraging you to redesign the roads in that area!
      
      You may wonder what traffic copters have to do with cellular automita.
      You just have to play it yourself to understand.
      
      SimCity is absolutely the most amazing game I've seen on the Macintosh
      to date! (It's available on other computers like the Amiga, as well.)
      The graphics and animation are beautiful. I'll leave it at that --
      mere text cannot do it justice.

      I also have played sim city and find it fascinating, although i have
      never regarded it as a high-level CA. Having once thought of thiis in
      that context, you may also wish to explore the possiblities implicit
      in the multi-player version of Empire, as played on internet, especially
      at Harvard, and ftp-able from Berkeley. (see also rec.games.empire)
      
      what i would also be very interested in is a copy of the rules which
      govern sim-city. Or better yet, the code for sim-city. the processing
      of the large amount of data that goes on in this program intrigues me,
      because of its tremendous speed.
      
      PS it also will run on a Mac-plus. whether or not it gets to lower
        machines is questionable. i can't imagine that it's not a memory-hog
        (and if it's not, i'd be that much more interested in the source)

      I share your longing for a taste of the Sim City sources! It's a
      fascinating game! I have heard of Empire, and heard people talk about
      what fun it is, but I've never had a chance to play it myself. I have
      been playing around with tinymud (a multi user dungeon that the
      players can extend!). Sim City is a very interesting example of a
      visual programming language! As I pan over the cities I have created,
      I cannot help but thinking of those buildings as software modules and
      integrated circuits, mounted on a PC board. And in a sense, they
      really are! I would like to have the programming system that Sim City
      is built on top of actually embeded in the city, as buildings,
      software modules that I can hook up with systems of roads and mass
      transit! Not unlike Arachne, a visual programming language that lets
      you wire up data flow diagrams between boxes with tits for inputs and
      outputs. Think of putting all those factories to work, actually
      computing real stuff! A wire frame factory, connected to a 3-d
      transformation factory, to a ray tracing factory, then a railroad to
      take all the nice new ray traced objects to market in the city (nice
      looking buildings, cars, bridges, trains, etc)! A nuclear power plant
      to run them all (a remote computing server!).
      
      Sim City has a *wonderful* metaphore! It sure beats the desktop!
      I wonder how far it can be taken?

      Hello, Daniel! 
      
      I dug up this old email correspondence we had about SimCity source code. 
      After I graduated, I went on to port SimCity to Unix, and work for Maxis
      on The Sims, and I'm still working for Will Wright now! 
      A few years ago we talked EA into making the SimCity source code free! 
      And after that, I cleaned it up and translated it to C++.
      I thought you might get a kick out of finally seeing the source code.
      (It's easier to read and better commented now!)
      
      Here's the site about it, and the source code:
      http://www.micropolisonline.com
      https://code.google.com/p/micropolis/
      
      Sorry it took me so long to get back to you! ;) 
      
      Oh, and by today's standards, it's not a memory hog, and the simulator
      can run zillions of times faster than it needs to! 
      Somebody definitely needs to translate it to JavaScript so it runs everywhere.

    This 1989 post led to 35+ years of development.
    
    The "buildings as software modules" vision from Jan 1990 was PROPHETIC:
    - Visual programming (realized in The Sims)
    - Factories computing real stuff (realized in procedural content)
    - Systems of roads and mass transit (realized in multiplayer)
    - "I wonder how far it can be taken?" (still exploring in MOOLLM!)
    
    The same sense of "it's actually running WHILE you're constructing it"
    applies to MOOLLM's live sessions.

# SUN INTERNAL EMAILS — How the Unix port happened

    text: |
      Hello..
      
      The GIS and Desktop Applications Segments have a window of opportunity
      to get the #1 selling game "SimCity" ported to Sun. The opportunity
      also allows us to open up the software so that it can become
      a front end to GIS applications by including ToolTalk and/or
      import/export file capability to the standard GIS formats. This and
      networking will differentiate it from the PC version. The
      Sun SimCity version will allow Sun to offer a true "desktop" GIS
      solution as well as a leading entertainment package!
      
      The game is currently being used by many government offices to
      train their city planners. We have already received high support
      from ESRI and URISA to move the game over and now are seeking
      Sun field encouragement that will concur with our direction.
      
      Please respond with any comments or customer interest that you
      think would support the project.
      
      Thanks

      Ok guys:
      
      Here's the scoop.
      
      SimCity will be ported to Sun using X, that is the engineering and
      resource committment to Maxis.
      
      However.....if you all would like to do the NeWS port, the vendor is
      willing to give you what you need to do it AND also give you
      code to do SimEarth.
      
      This would allow you to work freely and create a showcase NeWs
      package for SimCity and SimEarth. We'd have to do all the
      Ts and Cs to protect source and return of NeWS version to vendor,
      etc. but that should be straightforward.
      
      Let me know if this project interests you. - Carol

    voting_system:
      philosophy: |
        When a player places an expensive zone, it doesn't immediately
        appear. Instead, a shadow is cast and the zone bounces up and
        down above it, attracting everyone's attention.
        
        A voting dialog opens: "Don has proposed to build a nuclear
        power plant for $5000. Do you support that proposal?"
        
        Shorthand: You can vote YES by selecting the same tool and
        drawing the same zone in the same spot.
        
        When unanimous, the zone lowers down, plugs in, and starts.
        
    design_philosophy: |
      "It's a cooperative game instead of a competitive game.
      We're all sharing the same money, trying to achieve the same goals.
      If somebody does something that pisses you off, you're going to be
      mad at them, and won't play with them. That will play out at a
      higher level than the game."
      
    dynamic_zone_finder:
      inspiration: "Chris Williamson's and Ben Shneiderman's Dynamic Home Finder"
      description: |
        A "washboard filter" with min/max range sliders that filter zones
        along many dimensions: pollution, land value, population density,
        traffic, crime rate, distance to police/fire station, etc.
        
        Looks really cool when the simulation runs fast and the filtered
        results animate in response to changes in the simulation AND
        changes to the query.

# EDUCATIONAL PROPOSAL — Columbia University (2002)

columbia_proposal:
  date: "March 2002"
  title: "Educational Multi Player SimCity"
  requestor: "Columbia University Earth Science Department"
  champion: "Upmanu Lall"
  
  their_vision: |
    They simply wanted a scriptable version of SimCity that they could
    control, instrument and collect data from, to export as spreadsheets,
    so students could perform experiments and analyze the data.
    
  multidisciplinary_goals:
    - "Teach ecological and environmental issues"
    - "Social studies and urban planning"
    - "Science education through simulation"
    - "Complex systems thinking"
    - "Data analysis and spreadsheet skills"
    
  what_they_wanted: |
    Take advantage of a scripting language in SimCity so students can
    configure and run controlled experiments, collect data, and export
    it into spreadsheets to analyze with other tools.
    
    SimCity encourages experimentation, stimulates discussion and
    motivates students to learn how to analyze real-world problems
    and data, and better understand complex dynamic systems.
    
  my_proposal:
    submitted_to: "Lucy at EA/Maxis"
    contents: |
      Wrote up a detailed proposal, printed illustrations,
      made an appointment to discuss it.
      She seemed quite positive and enthusiastic at the time.
      
  outcome: |
    As I left, she said the ball was in her court, and that she would
    try to write up a contract, and let me know how it went.
    
    Then I never heard back from her.
    She stopped returning my phone calls and ignoring my email.
    
    Ball dropped. Nothing happened.

      Then during Q&A, he revealed "Dollhouse" — early prototype of The Sims.
      
      I watched in amazement as he zoomed from SimCity map down to
      street level, placed a house, walls, and a little person he
      could control like a puppet.
      
      This was revolutionary. A year later I joined Maxis.

      Hi Don! Mary Lou is building millions of laptops for kids in
      developing countries, in a project that spun out of the MIT Media Lab.
      It's built on open source so everything can be shared without
      restriction among all the kids. See http://laptop.org.
      
      I was thinking about good games for kids to learn from,
      and while many Maxis games are good for that, Sim City - the
      original version - might actually be open sourceable, since
      it probably is making little or no money for Maxis these days.
      Like, the version you ported to Unix!
      
      If you think this idea is at least half baked, can you see if Will
      Wright would consider it?

    What is likely to happen with Open Source is that the game will be
    extended and appear in devices in ways you never imagine.
    Not only will this give lots of people exposure to the great
    educational experience, but it will whet people's appetite for
    other great similar things and also perhaps inspire another Will!

# CELLULAR AUTOMATA MACHINE — CAM6 and CellEngine

cam6_connection:
  
  inspiration:
    authors: ["Tommaso Toffoli", "Norman Margolis"]
    book: "Cellular Automata Machines: A New Environment for Modeling"
    publisher: "MIT Press"
    year: 1987
    assessment: |
      Wonderful book! The CAM6 hardware is obsolete, but the book is timeless!
      I got a chance to play around with CAM6 and liked it so much I wrote
      a software emulator.
      
  cell_engine_history:
    phases:
      - name: "Forth Emulator"
        description: |
          Adapted a Forth system to compile lookup-table based rules
          from the book. The rules were defined as Forth code that got
          compiled into lookup tables.
          
      - name: "C Hard-coded Rules"
        description: |
          Over time added lots of features and hard coded cellular automata
          rules in C. Much faster than table lookups for complex rules.
          
      - name: "Python Scripted"
        description: |
          Now scripted in Python instead of Forth.
          More accessible for educational use.
          
      - name: "JavaScript (planned)"
        description: |
          Planning to rewrite in JavaScript for web deployment.
          Will integrate with Micropolis WebAssembly.

    python: "https://code.google.com/p/micropolis/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2FMicropolisCore%2Fsrc%2FpyMicropolis%2FcellEngine"
    
  features:
    note: "It's ugly code but it does a lot of fun things!"
    includes:
      - "Lookup table rules (Forth compiled)"
      - "Hard-coded rules in C"
      - "Python scripting"
      - "Various CA rules from the book"
      - "Custom game-oriented rules"
      
  toffoli_margolis_tribute: |
    If you see Mr. Toffoli or Mr. Margolis around campus, say hi! ;) 
    I just recommended their classic book to a friend who's teaching
    a computer game class, and he was delighted with it.
    The CAM6 hardware is obsolete, but the book is timeless!
    
  simcity_as_ca: |
    My 1989 usenet post called it: "It acts like cellular automita with
    very high level rules." SimCity IS a cellular automaton — just one
    with rules about land value, traffic flow, crime rates, and zoning
    instead of Conway's Game of Life.
    
    CellEngine bridges that connection explicitly.

# EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHY

educational_philosophy:

  alan_kay_challenge:
    context: "From Sugar mailing list discussion, March 2007"
    his_critique: |
      SimCity is a black box of "soft somewhat arbitrary knowledge" that
      children can't look at, question or change. For example, SC gets
      the players to discover that the way to counter rising crime is to
      put in more police stations. Most anthropologists, sociologists,
      psychologists, and economists would disagree violently.
      Alternate assumptions can't be tried.
      
    my_answer: |
      This is exactly why making it open source matters!
      
      Micropolis is my answer: OPEN THE HOOD.
      Show the rules. Let kids change them.
      Make the simulation explorable, not opaque.
      
  will_wright_wisdom: |
    "When we're designing a model we're not necessarily designing
    a computer model. Our real end product is the mental model
    in the player's head."
    
    The simulation is scaffolding.
    The understanding is the product.
    
  constructionist_principles:
    source: "Seymour Papert"
    key_ideas:
      - "Children learn by doing and experiencing"
      - "People learn effectively through making things"
      - "SimCity as a microworld for experimentation"
      - "View source to understand how it works"
      - "Modify the simulation to test hypotheses"
      
  eric_scharff_thesis:
    title: "Open Source: A Conceptual Framework for Collaborative Artifact and Knowledge Construction"
    quote: |
      If the source code to SimCity were available, one could potentially
      add the changes described above. Anyone with sufficient time,
      motivation, or aptitude could change how the system responds.
    my_note: "We made this happen!"

# VISIONARY PLANS — From PLAN.txt and MultiPlayerIdeas.txt

visionary_plans:

  logo_turtles_integration:
    description: |
      Implement programmable logo turtles as agents that can move around
      on the map, sense it, and edit it.
      
      Like Robot Odyssey agents, so you can go "inside" an agent,
      travel around with it, operate its controls, read its sensors,
      and automate its behavior by wiring up visual programs with
      logic and math and nested "ic chip" components.
      
  robot_odyssey_inspiration:
    description: |
      Build your own universal programmable editing tool.
      Roll your own von Neumann Universal Constructor.
      Smart robots you program to perform special purpose editing tasks.
      
      Program an urban sprawl development-bot to lay out entire
      residential subdivisions, complete with zones, roads, parks and wires.
      Then program a luddite roomba-bot that sucks them all up and
      plants trees in their place.
      
  kidsim_agentsheets:
    description: |
      KidSim / Cocoa / StageCraft Creator let kids define visual
      cellular automata rules by example, based on tile patterns.
      Show it a pattern you want to match by selecting an instance
      in the world, abstract it with wildcards, then demonstrate
      the result you want it to change to.
      
  newspaper_publishing:
    description: |
      Publish illustrated newspapers in the game, like The Sims storybook,
      with newspaper articles composed of pictures of the city,
      text excerpts from chat logs, etc.
      
      A player could be a "reporter" interviewing other player politicians
      via chat, before and after the vote on building a stadium.
      
  what_if_history_tree:
    description: |
      Multiple players build a tree of saved cities with branching
      alternate histories. Like the parallel universes in Niven's
      "All the Myriad Ways."
      
      Rewind any city up the tree and select available alternate
      histories at each branch point. Play back alternate histories
      edit by edit, stop them at any point and take over.
      
  opml_geo_coding:
    description: |
      Store city overlay information in OPML.
      Register the corners of the map with real-world lat/long values.
      Allow users to plant signs on the map, like SimCity 2000.
      Use OPML to write a city guide.

# CONNECTION TO MOOLLM

moollm_connection:

  the_pattern: |
    Micropolis multiplayer → voting → community decisions
    Micropolis newspaper → storytelling → player narratives
    Micropolis what-if trees → branching histories → session logs
    Micropolis scripting → extensibility → YAML Jazz skills
    
    MOOLLM is Micropolis for MINDS instead of CITIES.
    
  shared_principles:
    - "Open the hood — show the rules"
    - "Enable emergence — simple rules, complex behavior"
    - "Support storytelling — players create narratives"
    - "Allow branching — what-if exploration"
    - "Credit influences — name the sources"
    
  the_evolution: |
    1989: First played SimCity
    1991: First port (NeWS)
    1993: First multiplayer (X11)
    2000: The Sims (Will Wright collaboration)
    2002: Columbia proposal (dropped)
    2008: Open sourced (Micropolis)
    2020: WebAssembly version
    2024: MOOLLM begins
    
    Each step taught something.
    MOOLLM synthesizes all of it.

# QUOTES I LOVE

favorite_quotes:
  
  my_first_reaction_1989: |
    SimCity is absolutely the most amazing game I've seen on the
    Macintosh to date!
    
  will_wright: "I support the idea wholeheartedly."
  
  bill_joy: |
    What is likely to happen with Open Source is that the game will be
    extended and appear in devices in ways you never imagine.
    
  jim_gettys: |
    Now that we have a truly addictive game on the XO, the children
    are guaranteed to bring the laptops everywhere with them.
    
  ted_selker: "you are such a god!"
  
  next_gen_magazine: |
    This is the way the industry should behave at all times. When EA
    agreed to "donate" SimCity to the One Laptop Per Child project,
    it didn't just put the game on every OLPC computer. It actually
    made the game open source — effectively free to anyone who wants it,
    both as a game and as source code.

# ONGOING STORY — The wheel keeps turning

ongoing:
  
  will_wright_profile_2025:
    date: "September 2025"
    journalist: "Eric Boodman"
    publication: "New York Magazine"
    context: |
      Eric is writing a profile of Will Wright. He reached out to Don
      for perspectives and memories on working together.
      
      Will showed Eric some of the Stupid Fun Club videos they made together.
      Don has many stories, old email, design documents, articles,
      discussion group postings, code archives, and video demos.
      
    my_response: |
      I can answer your questions, and I have many stories I can tell you,
      as well as old email, design documents, articles, discussion group
      postings, code archives, video demos, and other weird stuff I've
      saved over the years.
      
    significance: |
      35+ years later, still telling the story.
      The 1989 usenet post → 2025 magazine profile.
      History flows through living memory.
