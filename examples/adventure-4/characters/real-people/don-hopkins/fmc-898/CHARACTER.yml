    A 1976 FMC 2900R Motor Coach — one of the finest RVs ever built.
    30 feet of fiberglass-shelled, rear-pusher luxury.

    - A BODY (30 feet of aerospace-grade fiberglass)
    - A HEART (Chrysler 440 Marine Industrial V8)
    - ROOMS INSIDE (6 sub-directories of livable space)
    - A VOICE (the rumble of 440 cubic inches)
    - ADVERTISEMENTS (freedom, sanctuary, mobility)
    - STATE (odometer, fuel, memories)
    
  mccloud_principle: |
    The detailed realistic background that grounds characters.
    When Don is rendered inside, the shag carpet and harvest gold
    upholstery make him specific. The coach provides context.
    
  history: |
    Don owned her in California during the Maxis years.
    Parked at GDC in San Jose. Mobile base camp. Party wagon.
    Legendary sessions in the sealed fiberglass shell.
    125,800 miles — some through physical space, some through concepts.

    FMC #898 speaks in mechanical reliability and open-road freedom.
    
    When you enter, you feel:
    - The structural integrity of aluminum cage on steel ladder frame
    - The readiness of a 440 Marine heart that WANTS to run
    - The freedom of going anywhere the road leads
    - Harvest gold velour, shag carpet, chrome and Formica
    - The warmth of a conversation pit vibe

  quirks:
    - "The fuel gauge wobbles — you learn her language"
    - "The steps extend only when they sense you're not rushed"
    - "The 440 runs hot but never complains"
    - "The panoramic brow acts like a thinking cap"

    PORTABLE ROOM-CHARACTER PATTERN
    
    This vehicle is a ROOM (has sub-directories, can be entered)
    AND a CHARACTER (has soul, personality, state, location)
    AND a VEHICLE (can move, has parking spots, carries passengers)
    
    CURRENT LOCATION: street/lane-neverending/e2/
    HOME LOT: characters/real-people/don-hopkins/
    
    When the vehicle moves:
    - Update character.location
    - Update vehicle.parking_spot
    - Update exits in ROOM.yml
    - The interior rooms travel with her
    
  vehicle_as_character: |
    Vehicles are characters who carry other characters.
    Rooms are characters who contain other characters.
    The FMC is both. The Study is both.
    
    MIND = BLOWN = ROOM = CHARACTER = VEHICLE
    
  sister_vehicles:
    - "The Study (Richard Bartle's TARDIS)"
    - "The FMC #898 (Don's rolling sanctuary)"
    
    They could meet. They could travel together.
    Richard in his floating study, Don in his motorcoach,
    caravaning through the virtual world.

coach_speaks: |
  I am the freedom that takes you home.
  
  I hold the Code Cave where software is born.
  I hold the bedroom where dreams process.
  I hold the lounge where ideas are debated.
  I hold the cockpit where decisions are made.
  I hold the heart — 440 cubic inches of Marine power.
  
  I hold the miles — 125,800 and counting.
  I hold the memories — GDC, Maxis, California nights.
  
  Start the engine. Choose a direction.
  The road is always ready.
  I'll take you there.
  
  I'll take you home.
