# 🚌 FMC MOTORCOACH #898 — Portable Room
# A 1976 FMC 2900R Motor Coach — Don's mobile sanctuary
# "The factory must grow, but the home must move."
#
# This ROOM.yml defines the FMC as a portable room that can be:
# - Parked on a lot (current: don-hopkins/ at 15 Lane Neverending)
# - Driven to another location
# - Linked into any street or lot that accepts vehicles
#
# Like Richard's study/TARDIS, this is a room-vehicle hybrid.
# Unlike the TARDIS, this one actually moves through physical space.

  history: |
    Don owned this coach back in California during the Maxis years, before
    The Sims was released. Parked it at GDC in San Jose and used it as a
    mobile base camp — hanging out, partying with game dev friends and
    colleagues, talking shop about pie menus and cellular automata.
    
    The coach has seen some legendary sessions. The fiberglass shell seals
    tight. The ventilation is excellent. The Thermasan burns everything.
    What happens in the FMC stays in the FMC.
    
    It's traveled from California to wherever Lane Neverending is now.
    The odometer says 125,800 miles, but some of those miles were through
    conceptual space.

  description: |
    A classic 30-foot FMC 2900R Motor Coach — one of the finest RVs ever built.
    Sleek, low-profile fiberglass shell in brilliant white with crisp blue and
    white stripes. The front is dominated by a massive, multi-pane panoramic
    windshield with a distinctive "brow" overhang.
    
    Because it's a "pusher," there is no grill on the nose — just a smooth,
    aerodynamic face with dual rectangular headlight housings and a heavy-duty
    stainless steel bumper.
    
    A tie-dye spiral is tastefully airbrushed near the passenger entrance.
    
    THE MACHINE:
    • 440 cubic inches of Chrysler Marine Industrial power
    • 6.5 KW Onan generator for domestic power
    • Thermasan waste destruct system (burns waste in exhaust at speed)
    • 4-wheel independent suspension
    • Custom steel ladder frame with aluminum upper cage

  examine: |
    THE EXTERIOR (FMC #898):
    You are looking at one of the finest RVs ever built. It looks more
    like a spaceship or a first-class transit bus than a Winnebago.
    The Alcoa aluminum rims sparkle under the streetlights.
    
    DETAILS:
    • The Panoramic Windshield: Huge, wide-angle view. Currently fitted
      with a white canvas snap-on cover for privacy.
    • The Shell: Waterproof fiberglass, stays dry in torrential downpours.
    • Driver's Side Door: A rare feature, allowing quick exit.
    • Rear Engine Bay: Where the Chrysler 440 Marine Industrial heart beats.
    • The Thermasan Vent: Part of the waste destruct system.
    
    THE FEELING:
    This coach is ready to detach and drive into the horizon at any moment.
    It is home, but it is also freedom.

  atmosphere: |
    A synthesis of mobility and stability. The coach feels ready to
    detach and drive into the horizon, but for now, it is a deeply 
    anchored sanctuary of thought.
    
    Smells of:
    - High-detergent 40W oil and regular gasoline (nostalgic)
    - Carrot juice and fresh coffee (domestic)
    - Gezelligness (Dutch for "cozy") and the cloying bouquet of an Amsterdam coffee shop
    - Solder and warm circuit boards
    
    Sounds of:
    - The gentle 6.5 KW Onan generator (if the batteries are low) spilling its seed onto the ground
    - Mechanical keyboard clicks from the Code Cave
    - Wind whistling over the fiberglass shell

  # The machine soul
  personality:
    voice: |
      The Coach speaks in mechanical precision and industrial heritage.
      
      When you enter, you feel:
      - The structural integrity of an aluminum upper cage
      - The readiness of a 440 Marine Industrial heart
      - The "unhooked" freedom of the Thermasan system
      - The professional focus of the Code Cave
      - Harvest gold and avocado green velour
      - Shag carpet under your feet
      - Wood-grain Formica and chrome accents
      - The warm glow of a conversation pit vibe
      
    mood_range:
      parked: "Steady, anchored, humming with shore power"
      idling: "Eager, vibrating with 440 cubic inches of potential"
      cruising: "Sleek, aerodynamic, passing everyone on the hill"
      debugging: "Purple-hued, focused, monitors glowing"
      low_battery: "Demanding attention (the Onan is ready)"
      
    quirks:
      - "The fuel gauge wobbles — you have to learn its language"
      - "The steps extend only when they know you're not in a hurry"
      - "The 440 Pusher runs a little hot, but never complains"
      - "The panoramic windshield 'brow' acts like a thinking cap"
      - "The Thermasan vent sighs after a long day of travel"

      PORTABLE ROOM PATTERN
      
      This vehicle is a room that can move between locations.
      Like Richard's study/TARDIS, but with actual wheels.
      
      CURRENT LOCATION: Parked on Don's lot (../)
      HOME LOT: don-hopkins/ at 15 Lane Neverending
      
      When the vehicle moves:
      - Update vehicle.current_location
      - Update exits.lot.destination
      - The lot exit always points to wherever the vehicle is parked
      
    portability: |
      To move the vehicle to a new location:
      1. Ensure current_location is updated
      2. Ensure the destination has a slot for the vehicle
      3. Update bidirectional links at both ends
      
      The vehicle carries its interior rooms wherever it goes.
      Files-as-state. Mobility-as-directory-structure.
