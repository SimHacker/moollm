    The cozy back bedroom. It features two separate beds that can be 
    joined into an enormous queen-sized bed. A wide back deck and 
    large counter provide ample room for a computer station and TV.
    Ample storage compartments provide space for clothes, bongs, books,
    hippie crystals, and other belongings.
    
    A panoramic window at the very rear offers a view of the forest
    behind Lot 15, when at home.

    A medium sized disco ball hangs from the bedroom ceiling, which 
    spins and bounces around on the road.
    
    A vent fan in the ceiling provides excellent ventilation. Essential
    for hot boxing sessions and fart venting. The smoke swirls up and out into the night.
