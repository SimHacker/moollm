    The main living area of the coach. On the left side is a long, 
    versatile sofa-lounge. On the right, a Fore 'N Aft travel seat
    provides comfortable couch-like seating for two while traveling,
    and converts to an L-shaped sofa or dining area when parked.
    
    The kitchen unit is integrated along the side wall, featuring
    compact but high-quality appliances. The ceiling has a purple
    glow from custom lighting.

  atmosphere: |
    A perfect synthesis of a 1970s luxury motorhome and a 2020s 
    hacker space. It smells of fresh coffee and carrot juice.
