  purpose: |
    Documentation of the Neptune/VJ music visualization project
    at Stupid Fun Club, extracted from primary source emails.
    
    This was a Unity3D music world with terrain, pie menus,
    and video playback — pitched to Apple.

# PROJECT OVERVIEW
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

project:
  names:
    - "Neptune"
    - "VJ"
    - "FunPlace"
    - "FunWorld"
  
  what_it_was: |
    A music visualization world where songs are represented as icons
    scattered across a zoomable 3D terrain. Users navigate like Google Maps
    (drag to pan, double-click to zoom, mousewheel zoom).
    
    Pie menus appear when clicking on songs, with options to play,
    show video, view photos, etc.
    
    Built in Unity3D with C# scripts.
    
  key_features:
    - "Zoomable terrain world (like Google Maps)"
    - "Song icons draped over landscape"
    - "Pie menus for song interaction"
    - "Video playback (YouTube sources)"
    - "Rollover audio preview"
    - "Particle effects ('party explosions')"
    - "Multiple zoom levels with tile caching"
    
  pitch_target: "Apple"
  pitch_date: "April 23, 2010"

      Icons draped over terrain have perspective displacement

      or use orthogonal projection.

  january_2010:
    date: "January 18, 2010"
    description: |
      First screencast demo uploaded. Testing terrain model, zooming/panning,
      physics simulation, dynamically loaded images.
      
      "You can pan and zoom over the terrain, and create three types of objects
      texture mapped with random icons: sphere, cube and cylinder."
      
      Objects fall, bounce on terrain, swell/throb, push each other,
      "spill over into nearby valleys and rivers through the terrain,
      a lot like water particles!"
    will_response: "Sounds great, look forward to seeing it."
    
  march_2010:
    date: "March 24, 2010"
    description: "10,000 icons demo"
    will_feedback: |
      "Let's now drop to about 5K icons with somewhat of a 'clumpy' distribution.
      -and focus on a fast (mousewheel) zooming control.
      -again, interface like google maps (left-drag scroll, double left click zoomin)"
      
  v6_april_2010:
    date: "April 12, 2010"
    version: "V6"
    feedback:
      - "Take out the sphinx for now"
      - "Expose mousewheel velocity multiplier"
      - "PC keyboard behavior buggy"
      - "Double-click zoom anywhere"
      - "Keep icons roughly uniform size"
      - "Put song name near cursor (in-world)"
    next_steps:
      - "Pie menu on click-and-hold"
      - "New terrain asset pipeline"
      
  v19_june_2010:
    date: "June 28, 2010"
    version: "V19"
    tester: "Lisa Winter"
    feedback:
      menu_confusion: "Not sure how to use this menu"
      zoom: "Odd that clicking once zoomed in, but I got used to it fast"
      pie_menu_issue: |
        "The circle menu looks nice, but I don't like how it disappears
        when I try to click on an icon. Also, the icon moves away when
        I try to click it, so I must continue until I can catch the icon."
      camera_icons: "When I click the left camera or joystick icons a circle of photos appears. Not sure what this does."
      explosions: |
        "When each icon is clicked it produces an explosion;
        not a 'destroying explosion', but more of a 'party explosion'.
        It's fun, though I feel that only the bomb icon should cause an explosion,
        cuz I wasn't sure if I was blowing the song up or not."
      timing: "The time between 'holding the mouse over an icon' and 'when the song plays' seems slightly non-uniform."
    will_feedback:
      - "I'd like the rollover delay to be shorter, about 1/3 current value"
      - "This build doesn't seem to have the new music (Lady Gaga, etc)"

    Complete C# script preserved from email.
    This is the navigation/camera controller for the VJ world.
    
    Key patterns:
    - Animated zoom/pan with easing
    - Mouse drag with velocity "throw"
    - Song hover detection
    - Pie menu integration
    - Terrain clamping

# MOOLLM CONNECTIONS
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

moollm_connections:

  pie_menus: |
    VJ/Neptune used pie menus for song interaction.
    Same pattern as SimCity, The Sims, and now MOOLLM room navigation.
    
  zoomable_worlds: |
    The terrain-based zoomable world concept prefigures
    MOOLLM's room hierarchy navigation.
    
  content_visualization: |
    Songs as icons on terrain → YAML files as rooms in adventure.
    Same problem: how to navigate large content collections.
    
  will_wright_collaboration: |
    These emails document the day-to-day working relationship
    between Don and Will — the creative feedback loop that
    produced The Sims and these later experiments.
    
  the_dsb_concept: |
    Will's "song lyrics → Google image search → slideshow" idea
    is essentially what MOOLLM does with semantic search and
    context assembly. The thread continues.
