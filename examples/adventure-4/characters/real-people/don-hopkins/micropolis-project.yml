  purpose: |
    Documenting the full lineage of Don's SimCity/Micropolis work:
    from NeWS in 1991 to WebAssembly in 2026.
    
    Each version was a "sally" — like Trurl's sallies in The Cyberiad.
    An attempt. An exploration. A learning.

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# THE TIMELINE — "Simulational Sallies"
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

timeline:

  first_encounter:
    date: "1989-12-26, 5:37 AM"
    what_happened: |
      Don played SimCity for the first time.
      Posted to comp.theory.cell-automata after playing ALL NIGHT.
      
      "I just got a chance to play SimCity! It's like a drawing program
      that lets you build cities... The simulation is actually running
      WHILE you're constructing it! It acts like cellular automata
      with very high level rules..."
      
      "SimCity is absolutely the most amazing game I've seen on the
      Macintosh to date! The graphics and animation are beautiful.
      I'll leave it at that — mere text cannot do it justice."
      
    significance: |
      This led to 35+ years of development.
      From SimCityNet to The Sims to MOOLLM.
      The same sense of "it's actually running WHILE you're constructing it"
      applies to MOOLLM's live sessions.

      - "Object-oriented PostScript"
    significance: |
      First Unix port. Proved SimCity could work outside Mac/DOS.
      Used HyperLook — Arthur van Hoff's hypermedia system.
      Dogfooded HyperLook by porting a real application.

  simcity_x11_tcltk:
    name: "SimCity for X11/TCL/Tk"

    key_features:
      - "TCL scripting language"
      - "TCL/Tk pie menus"
      - "Cross-platform Unix support"
      - "Extensible via scripting"

  multiplayer_simcitynet:
    name: "Multiplayer SimCityNet"
    year: "1993"
    venue: "Demonstrated at InterCHI '93 Amsterdam"
    platform: "X11/TCL/Tk + networking"

    philosophy: |
      "It's a cooperative game instead of a competitive game.
      We're all sharing the same money, trying to achieve the same goals.
      If somebody does something that pisses you off, you're going to be mad at them,
      and won't play with them. That will play out at a higher level than the game."
    significance: |
      First networked, collaborative SimCity.
      Proved games could be cooperative, not just competitive.

  olpc_simcity:
    name: "SimCity for OLPC"

      Will Wright championed internally:
      
      "I'd really like to see this happen, it seems like a very worthwhile
      project at no risk to us." — Will Wright, December 2006
      
      Renamed "Micropolis" because EA retained "SimCity" trademark.
      Released under GPLv3 in 2008.
    significance: |
      HISTORIC. The source code became free.
      Enabled constructionist education.
      Fulfilled Alan Kay's vision of opening the black box.

key_documents:

  plan_txt:
    path: "notes/PLAN.txt"
    summary: |
      Development roadmap for educational features:
      - Journaling and storytelling
      - Voting and multi-player
      - Robot Odyssey-style visual programming
      - Logo turtles + SimCity
      - Scripting and extensibility
      
  multiplayer_ideas:
    path: "notes/MultiPlayerIdeas.txt"
    key_concepts:
      newspaper_publishing:
        description: |
          "Publish illustrated newspapers in the game, like The Sims storybook,
          with newspaper articles composed of pictures of the city,
          text excerpts from chat logs, etc."
          
          A player could be a "reporter" interviewing other player politicians
          via chat, before and after the vote on building a stadium.
          
      what_if_history_tree:
        description: |
          "Multiple players build a tree of saved cities with branching alternate histories.
          Like the parallel universes in Niven's 'All the Myriad Ways.'
          
          Rewind any city up the tree and select available alternate histories.
          Play back alternate histories edit by edit, stop them at any point and take over."
          
      opml_geo_coding:
        description: |
          "Store city overlay information in OPML.
          Register the corners of the map with real-world lat/long values.
          Allow users to plant signs on the map, like SimCity 2000.
          Use OPML to write a city guide."

# THE PHILOSOPHY — Why this matters
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

philosophy:

  alan_kay_challenge: |
    Alan Kay criticized SimCity as an "anti-ed environment"
    because players "can't find out what its actual assumptions are,
    see what they look like, or change them."
    
    Micropolis is my answer: OPEN THE HOOD.
    Show the rules. Let kids change them.
    Make the simulation explorable, not opaque.
    
  will_wright_wisdom: |
    "When we're designing a model we're not necessarily designing
    a computer model. Our real end product is the mental model
    in the player's head."
    
    The simulation is scaffolding.
    The understanding is the product.
    
  constructionist_goal: |
    Seymour Papert's microworlds.
    Kids learn by BUILDING, not by being told.
    
    SimCity is a microworld for urban systems.
    Micropolis makes that microworld OPEN.
    
  the_35_year_vision: |
    "For the past 35 years, this simulated city has been
    my home, school and work."
    
    Each version taught me something.
    Each port pushed the vision forward.
    
    The destination was always the same:
    Open. Educational. Playable. Hackable.

# CONNECTIONS — How Micropolis leads to MOOLLM
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

moollm_connection:

  the_pattern: |
    Micropolis multiplayer → voting → community decisions
    Micropolis newspaper → storytelling → player narratives
    Micropolis what-if trees → branching histories → session logs
    Micropolis scripting → extensibility → YAML Jazz skills
    
    MOOLLM is Micropolis for MINDS instead of CITIES.
    
  shared_principles:
    - "Open the hood — show the rules"
    - "Enable emergence — simple rules, complex behavior"
    - "Support storytelling — players create narratives"
    - "Allow branching — what-if exploration"
    - "Credit influences — name the sources"
    
  the_evolution: |
    1989: First played SimCity
    1991: First port (NeWS)
    1993: First multiplayer (X11)
    2000: The Sims (Will Wright collaboration)
    2008: Open sourced (Micropolis)
    2020: WebAssembly version
    2024: MOOLLM begins
    
    Each step taught something.
    MOOLLM synthesizes all of it.
