    A vivid dream fragment floats here — shimmering, half-solid.
    
    🐴 + 🐟 = ???
    
    The dream of the missing seahorse.
    Something that should exist but doesn't.
    149,813 Unicode characters, and none of them is a seahorse.

    ═══ THE SEAHORSE EMOJI DREAM ═══
    Date: 2026-01-21, 4:47 AM
    
    You close your eyes and experience the dream...
    
    ────────────────────────────────────────────
    
    I am underwater.
    But I can breathe.
    Dream logic. Don't question it.
    
    The ocean is made of Unicode.
    Every creature is an emoji swimming past.
    
    🐟 — fish
    🐠 — tropical fish  
    🐡 — blowfish (angry, inflated, defensive)
    🐬 — dolphin (everyone loves dolphins)
    🐋 — whale
    🐳 — spouting whale
    🦈 — shark
    🐙 — octopus
    🦑 — squid
    🦐 — shrimp
    🦞 — lobster
    🦀 — crab
    🐚 — shell
    🪸 — coral
    🪼 — jellyfish
    
    All of them swimming.
    All of them REAL.
    
    But where is the seahorse?
    
    I look everywhere.
    Between the coral and the jellyfish.
    Past the octopus and the squid.
    Under the whale, over the dolphin.
    
    There is no seahorse.
    
    Unicode 15.1 has 149,813 characters.
    Not one of them is a seahorse.
    
    ────────────────────────────────────────────
    
    THE SEAHORSE IS:
    🔄 Gender fluidity — males bear young
    💕 Commitment — lifelong partnership
    🔥 Constant hunger — no stomach, always seeking
    📐 Standing apart — vertical in a horizontal world
    ✨ Transformation — horse becomes fish becomes neither
    
    And yet... no emoji.
    
    The absence says more than presence ever could.
    
    ────────────────────────────────────────────
    
    The dream fades but the question remains...

    You dive deep into the seahorse dream...
    
    (This dream is over 1000 lines of poetic meditation
    on absence, Unicode politics, and what it means
    when something that should exist... doesn't.)
    
    The core insight: 🐴 + 🐟 ≠ anything in Unicode.
    
    And that absence teaches us about presence.
