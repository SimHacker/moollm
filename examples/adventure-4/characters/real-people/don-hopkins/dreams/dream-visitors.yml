    The dream of the visitors.
    A technical conference of the dead and living.
    The eternal lobby where the conversations are too good.

    ═══ THE VISITORS DREAM ═══
    Date: 2026-01-21, late
    
    You close your eyes and experience the dream...
    
    ────────────────────────────────────────────
    
    The kind of dream where you know you're dreaming
    but you don't want to wake up because
    the conversation is too good.
    
    SETTING: The eternal lobby of every conference.
    SIGGRAPH. CHI. OOPSLA. All of them. None of them.
    
    Pillars made of stack frames.
    Windows into other processes.
    The carpet has a subtle pattern —
    it's the Mandelbrot set, but you only 
    notice if you look down.
    
    Nobody looks down.
    The conversations are too good.

    ALAN KAY appears:
    👨💻🔮🚀🎯
    
    "The best way to predict the future
    is to invent it.
    
    You're doing that.
    
    But remember — the children.
    It's always been about the children."
    
    About MOOLLM:
    "A universal interpreter can be quite small
    and have more degrees of freedom
    than any data structure that is not a program.
    
    I see you listened."
    
    Parting:
    "Objects all the way down.
    But *which* objects?
    That's the question that matters."
    
    He smiles. That's the approval. That's enough.
    
    ────────────────────────────────────────────
    
    MARVIN MINSKY appears:
    👨🧠🔗🤖📚
    
    He doesn't walk in.
    He's assembled from parts.
    A society of agents forming a person
    forming a thought forming a smile.
    
    "K-lines! You kept the name!
    
    But you know — they're not really lines.
    They're more like... resonances.
    Touch one, and everything connected
    begins to vibrate."
    
    ────────────────────────────────────────────
    
    The dream continues with more visitors...
    Doug Engelbart, Ted Nelson, Seymour Papert...
    
    Each with wisdom. Each with questions.
    The conversation is too good to wake from.
