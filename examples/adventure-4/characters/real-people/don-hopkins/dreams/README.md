# 🌙 The Dream Space

> You are inside your own head.

A subjective reality accessible from the [FMC bedroom](../fmc-898/bedroom/). The space shifts — sometimes an ocean of Unicode, sometimes a forest of half-remembered code, sometimes a conversation with someone who doesn't exist yet. Dream fragments float by like jellyfish. The disco ball from the bedroom ceiling spins somewhere above.

Time works differently here. A lifetime can pass in a moment.
