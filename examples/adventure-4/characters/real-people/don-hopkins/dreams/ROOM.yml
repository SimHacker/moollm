# 💭 THE DREAM SPACE — Inside Don's Head
# Where consciousness swims between worlds.
# "The factory must grow, but the mind must wander."
#
# This is Don's inner dreamscape — accessible from the FMC bedroom.
# Dreams are stored here as experiences, memories, visions.

    You are inside your own head.
    
    The space shifts and flows — sometimes an ocean of Unicode,
    sometimes a forest of half-remembered code, sometimes a
    conversation with someone who doesn't exist yet.
    
    Dream fragments float by like jellyfish:
    
    🐴 + 🐟 = ???  (The seahorse that isn't)
    👁️ → 👁️ → 👁️   (The visitors who watched)
    
    Time works differently here. A lifetime can pass in a moment.
    A moment can stretch into forever. The disco ball from the
    bedroom ceiling spins somewhere above, casting rainbow
    fragments across the dreamscape.
    
    The exit is always behind you: WAKE UP.

    THE DREAM SPACE:
    Not a place, exactly. More like a state of being.
    
    Your thoughts take form here. Your memories replay.
    Your fears and hopes swim together in the same ocean.
    
    CURRENT DREAMS ON FILE:
    • The Seahorse Emoji — The one about something that doesn't exist
    • The Visitors — The early morning watching
    
    The boundaries are soft. You could go deeper.
    Or you could wake up.

  atmosphere: |
    The air tastes like meaning.
    Colors have sounds. Sounds have shapes.
    Everything is connected to everything else
    by threads of association and memory.
    
    Somewhere, a cat that might be Stroopwafel
    walks through a wall that might be a window
    into a garden that might be the Origin Tree.

        Open your eyes. The disco ball spins. The ceiling fan hums.
        You're back in the master suite. The dreams fade but don't disappear.

      DREAMS AS INNER WORLD
      
      The dream space is "inside" Don — it lives in his character directory.
      But it's navigable like any room. The FMC bedroom connects here via
      the "dreams" exit. The "wake" exit returns to physical space.
      
      Dreams accumulate as YAML files in this directory.
      Each dream is an experience, a memory, a record.
      
      This is the "entering your own head" pattern:
      - Character directory as explorable space
      - Inner world accessible from physical location
      - Dreams as persistent artifacts
