# 👨🥧💤 DON'S DREAM — The Visitors
# Date: 2026-01-21
# Time: Late. Too late. Finally asleep.
#
# The kind of dream where you know you're dreaming
# but you don't want to wake up because
# the conversation is too good.

  date: 2026-01-21
  dreamer: 👨🥧🎮🐈💻
  type: technical_conference_of_the_dead_and_living
  mood: grateful
  
  setting:
    location: 🏛️💻∞
    # Not a room. A lobby. The eternal lobby
    # of every conference I've ever attended.
    # SIGGRAPH. CHI. OOPSLA. All of them. None of them.
    # The coffee is perfect. It's a dream.
    
    architecture: |
      Pillars made of stack frames.
      Windows into other processes.
      The carpet has a subtle pattern —
      it's the Mandelbrot set, but you only 
      notice if you look down.
      
      Nobody looks down.
      The conversations are too good.

        "K-lines! You kept the name!

        The one who was cursed to grant wishes.

      Like I'm talking to the textbook

      But the textbook is warm now.
      It has a handshake.

      They taught us that humility

        MOOLLM works the same way.
        You give the LLM enough structure

        The user testing — where is it?

        The accessibility — have you checked?
        
        Rigor. Rigor. Rigor.

        Be careful with that power."
