# THE THREAD — What connects it all

the_thread: |
  Every job taught me something that fed into the next.
  
  Apple II Forth → understanding how machines work
  UMD HCIL → pie menus, hypertext, empirical HCI
  Sun/NeWS → PostScript, networked graphics, visual debugging
  Kaleida → distributed objects, multimedia, Memory Palace concept
  Maxis → simulation, games, user-generated content, The Sims
  SFC → robotics, speech, storytelling, AI personalities
  TomTom → shipping at scale, content distribution
  Pantomime → AR/VR, Unity, JSON everywhere
  Leela → AI, LLMs, symbolic systems
  
  The thread: making complex systems understandable through play.
  
  "Code is philosophy. Every parameter is a hypothesis about how minds work."
