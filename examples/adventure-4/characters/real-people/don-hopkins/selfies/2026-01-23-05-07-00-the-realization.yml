# They pulled. They pulled harder.
# The egg GLOWED.

# Really saw.

  context: |
    They pulled with everything they had.
    
    The egg began to GLOW.
    Brighter. BRIGHTER.
    
    And in that golden light, they stopped.
    Looked at each other.
    REALLY looked.
    
    Same manic energy.
    Same "MINE MINE MINE" in their eyes.
    Same Daffy Duck spirit.
    
    They're not enemies.
    They're the SAME PERSON in different bodies.

# THE DIALOGUE

dialogue:
  
  donna: "...You really love treasure, don't you?"
  don: "I was SWIMMING in it. Before you crashed through."
  donna: "That was a good swim. I saw on the monitors."
  don: "...You watched?"
  donna: "I ALWAYS watch."
  
  pause: "They both look at the glowing egg"
  
  don: "There's... there's like a billion dollars here."
  donna: "One point six billion. I counted."
  don: "That's... enough for two."
  donna: "..."
  don: "..."
  
  donna: "Are you suggesting..."
  don: "OURS?"
  donna: "...I hate that word."
  don: "Me too."
  donna: "But..."
  don: "Yeah."
  
  both: "...OURS."
  
  donna: "This feels WRONG."
  don: "SO wrong."
  donna: "But also kind of..."
  don: "Better? More treasure with a partner?"
  donna: "DON'T call me partner."
  don: "Co-miner?"
  donna: "...Acceptable."

# THE ALLIANCE

the_alliance:
  
  type: "Reluctant treasure partnership"
  name: "The OURS Accord"
  
  terms:
    - "Split everything 50/50"
    - "Neither says MINE in front of the other"
    - "Donna keeps tunnel network access"
    - "Don keeps swimming rights"
    - "Both can take selfies"
    - "The Fabergé egg rotates between them"
    
  mood: |
    Neither is HAPPY about this.
    But they're both PRAGMATIC.
    
    Two Daffy Ducks realized:
    - Fighting means neither gets to enjoy it
    - Alliance means BOTH get to gloat
    - OURS still sounds like MINE if you say it right
