  Abstract Pixar-adjacent 3D render, joyful protest aesthetic:
  
  An anthropomorphic grey rabbit wearing a PINK INFLATABLE BUNNY COSTUME — the big puffy silly kind with an air-filled round body and oversized floppy ears.
  
  THE META MOMENT:
  - Real grey rabbit face visible through the costume's face hole
  - Real grey rabbit ears POKING UP THROUGH the pink inflatable costume ears
  - A rabbit IN a rabbit costume — the recursion is intentional
  - Subtle eyeliner still visible on real face
  
  THE COSTUME:
  - Classic pink inflatable bunny — round puffy body
  - Giant pink floppy ears (with real grey ears visible inside/through)
  - Silly buck teeth on the costume face
  - Stubby inflatable arms raised in celebration
  - Slightly deflating on one side (authentic protest wear)
  
  ACCESSORIES:
  - Hand-drawn cardboard protest sign: "PLAY IS PROTEST"
  - Tie-dye combat boots visible underneath the inflatable
  - Maybe a punk patch safety-pinned to the costume
  
  SETTING:
  - Cobblestone street at night outside a cozy pub
  - Warm street lamp lighting, pub windows glowing
  - Background: another protester in inflatable T-Rex costume
  - Background: another in inflatable FROG costume (Frog Brigade!)
  - Background: older bearded man (Richard) with pint, looking bemused
  
  EXPRESSION:
  - PURE JOY — huge genuine smile, eyes crinkled
  - Not performing — FEELING the absurdist happiness
  - This is play as protest, joy as resistance
  
  MOOD: Joyful political absurdity, Operation Inflation energy, Portland Frog Brigade spirit, recursive identity humor, play is protest, de-escalation through silliness, party as demonstration
