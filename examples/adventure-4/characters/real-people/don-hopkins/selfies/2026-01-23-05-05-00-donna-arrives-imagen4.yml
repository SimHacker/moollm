  Abstract Pixar-adjacent 3D render, dramatic cartoon confrontation:
  
  SPLIT SCENE — Two characters in a treasure vault having a dramatic standoff:
  
  LEFT SIDE — DON (the rabbit):
  - Grey anthropomorphic rabbit in gold-dusted tie-dye hoodie
  - Mid-swim in treasure pile, NOW FROZEN IN SHOCK
  - Expression: eyes wide, mouth agape, "OH NO" energy
  - Gold coins and gems cascading around him
  - One paw reaching toward a Fabergé egg
  - Still has pearls and gems tangled in fur
  
  RIGHT SIDE — DONNA (the nemesis, JUST ARRIVED):
  - Flamboyant cartoon character with orange skin, elaborate blonde pompadour
  - Navy blue suit, red tie, pink heart-shaped glasses
  - Multiple mushroom pins on lapel
  - BURSTING THROUGH an orange/black spiral tunnel vortex
  - Arms spread wide in triumphant arrival
  - Expression: HUGE GRIN, eyes gleaming with treasure lust
  - PHONE IN HAND — already taking selfie of her entrance
  - Pose: dynamic, claiming the space, theatrical
  
  THE TUNNEL:
  - Orange and black swirling spiral (ACME tunnel colors)
  - Still active, vortex energy behind Donna
  - She painted this tunnel herself — she OWNS it
  
  THE TREASURE BETWEEN THEM:
  - Mountains of gold coins
  - The contested Fabergé egg (both reaching for it!)
  - Mona Lisa painting visible
  - Red Ferrari, white yacht
  - Cash bundles scattered
  - Diamonds, gems everywhere
  
  MOOD: Cartoon rivalry! Two treasure maniacs meeting! "MINE!" vs "MINE!" Drama! Theatrical! Both characters with MAXIMUM cartoon avarice energy. 
  
  The moment of: "YOU THOUGHT YOU COULD SWIM IN TREASURE WITHOUT ME?!"
