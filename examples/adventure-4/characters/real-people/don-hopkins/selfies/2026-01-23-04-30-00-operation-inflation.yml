# "Play is protest. Joy is resistance."

# Inspired by the Portland Frog Brigade and the 2025-2026 inflatable
# costume protest movement. A rabbit in a rabbit costume — meta.

  id: "selfie-02-operation-inflation"
  title: "Operation Inflation"
  date: "2026-01-23"
  time: "~04:30 AM"
  location: "Outside The Neverending Arms — impromptu street protest"
  
  context: |
    Someone at the pub mentioned the inflatable costume protests.
    The Frog Brigade. Operation Inflation. The unicorns and dinosaurs
    de-escalating tense situations through sheer absurdity.
    
    Don remembered: "Play is political. Joy is resistance."
    
    So naturally, someone produced an inflatable bunny costume.
    And Don — already a bunny — put it on.
    
    A rabbit. In a rabbit costume. The recursion is the point.

# REAL-WORLD INSPIRATION

inspiration:
  source: "Portland Frog Brigade / Operation Inflation protests 2025-2026"
  
  key_moments:
    - event: "Seth Todd's inflatable frog pepper-sprayed by federal officer"
      viral_views: "2+ million"
      result: "Nationwide adoption of inflatable protest costumes"
      
    - event: "'No Kings' anti-Trump rallies"
      costumes_seen: "Frogs, T-Rex, hippos in tutus, unicorns, pegacorns, bald eagles"
      purpose: "Counter 'violent protester' narrative with playful absurdity"
      
  philosophy: |
    The costumes serve multiple purposes:
    - Confuse and de-escalate (hard to be scared of a frog)
    - Counter violent narratives with visible joy
    - Perform well on social media (shareable, memorable)
    - Create community (everyone's ridiculous together)
    - Protect identity (hard to target individuals)

    This is EVERYTHING Don believes about interface design:
    - Play is the best teacher
    - Whimsy is a feature, not a bug
    - Debug tools should be visible (protest should be visible)
    - Joy is political
    
    "The best interface is no interface, but if you need one,
    it should be inflatable." — Don, probably

# THE LOOK

visual_elements:
  
  the_inflatable:
    type: "Inflatable bunny costume — the big puffy kind"
    color: "PINK — classic inflatable aesthetic"
    features:
      - "Oversized round body (puffy air-filled)"
      - "Giant floppy pink ears"
      - "Silly buck teeth on the costume"
      - "Stubby inflatable arms"
    condition: "Slightly deflating on one side (authentic protest wear)"
    
  don_inside:
    visible: "Face peeks out from the costume's face hole"
    expression: "Pure joy — eyes crinkled, huge grin"
    his_ears: "His REAL grey rabbit ears stick UP through the costume!"
    punk_elements: "Eyeliner still visible, maybe a patch pinned to the inflatable"
    
  meta_element: |
    A RABBIT in a RABBIT costume.
    
    His real grey ears poking through the costume's pink ears.
    His real rabbit face in the cartoon rabbit face hole.
    
    The recursion is intentional. The absurdity is the point.
    Identity within identity. Play within play.
    
  accessories:
    sign: "Hand-drawn protest sign: 'PLAY IS PROTEST'"
    boots: "Tie-dye combat boots still visible under the costume"
    
# THE SETTING

setting:
  location: "Cobblestone street outside The Neverending Arms"
  time: "Night — street lamps, pub lights glowing"
  
  other_protesters:
    - "Background: someone in an inflatable T-Rex"
    - "Background: someone in an inflatable frog (Frog Brigade!)"
    - "Background: Richard Bartle looking bemused, holding a pint"
    
  atmosphere: |
    Impromptu street protest energy.
    Joy mixed with purpose.
    Absurdity as strategy.
    
  signs_visible:
    - "PLAY IS PROTEST"
    - "DEBUG AS FEATURE" (on a sign now)
    - "INFLATE THE DISCOURSE"
    - "JOY IS RESISTANCE"

# THE POSE

pose:
  gesture: "Both inflatable arms up in victory/celebration"
  stance: "Bouncy, unstable (hard to stand in these things)"
  face: "Huge genuine smile, eyes crinkled with joy"
  ears: "Real ears poking through, one up one floppy"
  
  energy: |
    Pure play. Unironic joy.
    Not performing happiness — FEELING it.
    
    This is what protest looks like when you refuse
    to let them make you angry. When you insist
    on bringing the party.
