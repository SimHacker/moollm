# THE TUG-OF-WAR — MINED
#
# "IT'S MINE!"
#
# One caption. Two claimants. Perfect dramatic irony.

  scene: "selfie-05-tug-of-war"

  emergent_caption: "IT'S MINE!"
  caption_genius: |
    The image generated ONE caption: "IT'S MINE!"
    
    But WHO is saying it?
    DON? DONNA? BOTH?
    
    Answer: BOTH. SIMULTANEOUSLY.
    
    They're saying the EXACT SAME THING.
    They're fighting over who gets to say MINE.
    They ARE the same energy.
    
    The caption floats above the egg — NEUTRAL.
    It belongs to whoever wins.
    (Nobody wins. They're both Daffy Duck.)

# THE EGG

layer_egg:
  
  item: "Fabergé Imperial Egg"

  position: "Dead center — THE PRIZE"
  
  status: "Being pulled by BOTH"
  
  value: "$33,000,000"
  
  symbolic_meaning: |
    The egg is EVERYTHING they're fighting over.
    
    It's not just an egg.
    It's the right to say MINE.
    It's victory.
    It's being RIGHT.
    
    $33 million, but really: PRICELESS to their egos.

# THE CHAOS

  flying_currency:
    cash_bills: "Multiple $100 bills swirling through air"

    trajectory: "Radiating outward from their struggle"
    
  the_pile:
    status: "Disturbed — mountains of gold beneath them"
    implication: "They're standing in MORE wealth than the egg"
    irony: "Fighting over $33M while standing in $1.6B"
    
  radial_burst:
    source: "Behind the egg"
    color: "Golden/orange dramatic rays"
    meaning: "THE SPOTLIGHT — this is the moment"

# THE DRAMATIC IRONY

layer_irony:
  
  observation_1: |
    They're standing in $1.6 BILLION of treasure.
    Fighting over a $33 million egg.
    
    There's ENOUGH FOR BOTH.
    But "enough" isn't the point.
    MINE is the point.
    
  observation_2: |
    "IT'S MINE!"
    
    They're saying the same words.
    They have the same energy.
    They're BOTH Daffy Duck.
    
    Maybe... they're the same?
    
  observation_3: |
    Neither has noticed:
    - The Mona Lisa is unguarded
    - The Ferrari is just sitting there
    - The yacht is available
    
    They're so focused on THIS egg
    they've forgotten EVERYTHING ELSE.
    
    Classic cartoon tunnel vision.
    (Pun intended, given Donna's entrance method.)

    strength: "Relentless, won't back down"

      probability: "25%"
      result: "While they fight, someone ELSE takes the egg"
      candidates: ["Richard Bartle", "The Instigator", "A THIRD tunnel traveler"]
      
  narrative_preference: |
    The most satisfying next beat:
    
    They pull so hard the egg GLOWS brighter...
    Then they BOTH realize they're exactly the same.
    
    "Wait. We're both screaming MINE."
    "We're both Daffy Duck."
    "There's $1.6 billion here."
    "...We could SHARE."
    "OURS?"
    
    The birth of the world's most reluctant partnership.
