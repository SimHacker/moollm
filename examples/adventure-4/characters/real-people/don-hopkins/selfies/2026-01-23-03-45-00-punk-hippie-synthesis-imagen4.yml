prompt: |
  Abstract Pixar-adjacent 3D render, stylized cartoon aesthetic:
  
  Anthropomorphic grey rabbit taking a bathroom mirror selfie. Confident smirk, owns his look completely.
  
  OUTFIT - THE SYNTHESIS:
  - Tie-dye hoodie in purple/blue/orange spirals (Grateful Dead aesthetic)
  - Safety pins decorating the seams (punk addition)
  - Hand-stitched black patches with white text: "DEBUG AS FEATURE"
  - Red anarchist-style patch on sleeve
  - Worn combat boots with TIE-DYE LACES (the key synthesis detail)
  
  ACCESSORIES:
  - Studded leather band wrapped around ONE ear only (asymmetric, punk)
  - Subtle smudged eyeliner on rabbit eyes (Siouxsie meets Bugs Bunny)
  - One ear standing up alert, one flopped relaxed (asymmetric energy)
  
  POSE:
  - Peace sign with one paw
  - Devil horns (rock gesture) with the other paw
  - Both gestures at once — hippie AND punk
  
  SETTING:
  - Pub bathroom mirror
  - Harsh fluorescent lighting
  - Background: graffiti'd wall, band stickers, punk venue energy
  - Slightly steamy mirror
  
  MOOD: Confident self-expression, joy in transformation, "I own this now" energy, playful defiance, warm punk aesthetic
  
  Character has just accepted a major transformation and is now STYLING it — making it his own. Pride without arrogance. Punk without anger. Hippie without passivity. THE SYNTHESIS.
