# LAYER 1: THE SPLIT COMPOSITION

layer_composition:
  
  structure: "PERFECT SPLIT — two-panel confrontation"
  
  left_panel:
    character: "Don"
    background: "Cool blue, spotlight from above"
    mood: "Shock, alarm, 'my treasure!'"

    character: "Donna"
    background: "ORANGE/BLACK SPIRAL TUNNEL"
    mood: "Triumphant arrival, MAXIMUM AVARICE"
    
  the_divide: |
    The image split itself into a comic book confrontation.
    
    LEFT = Don's world (cool, blue, treasure around him)
    RIGHT = Donna's world (hot, orange, tunnel vortex)
    
    Two universes colliding over one treasure.

# LAYER 2: DON'S PANEL — "OH NO!"

layer_don:
  
  label: "DON!" # EMERGENT — the image labeled him!
  speech_bubble: "OH NO!" # EMERGENT — the image gave him dialogue!

    inner_monologue: |
      "The tunnel— How did she— That's MY treasure—
       I was swimming in it FIRST—
       OH NO OH NO OH NO—"
       
  pose:
    stance: "Standing in treasure, arms out"

    - "Fabergé egg at his feet (GREEN AND GOLD)"
    - "Pearls around neck"
    - "Pink/purple/blue gems scattered"
    - "Gold coins falling through air"
    
  the_oh_no: |
    The image gave Don a SPEECH BUBBLE.
    
    "OH NO!"
    
    Not prompted. The image understood:
    - Don was having the time of his life
    - Donna just ruined it
    - This is an OH NO moment
    
    The coherence engine wrote dialogue.

# LAYER 3: DONNA'S PANEL — "MINE! MINE!"

layer_donna:
  
  labels: 
    - "MINE!" # Top right
    - "MINE!" # Bottom center
    
  double_mine_analysis: |
    The image gave Donna TWO "MINE!" declarations.
    
    Because ONE isn't enough for Donna.
    She doesn't just want it.
    She wants it TWICE.
    
    This is the Daffy Duck energy made manifest.
    
  appearance:
    skin: "Orange (consistent with character)"
    hair: "MAGNIFICENT blonde pompadour — gravity-defying"
    glasses: "Pink heart-shaped — THE SIGNATURE"

    energy: "I'M HERE AND I WANT EVERYTHING"
    
  pose:
    arms: "RAISED IN TRIUMPH — claiming the space"
    stance: "Power pose, theatrical entrance"
    body_language: "This vault is MINE now"
    
  the_tunnel:
    colors: "Orange and black spirals"
    status: "ACTIVE — swirling behind her"
    light: "Golden glow from tunnel center"
    significance: |
      CHEKHOV'S TUNNEL returns!
      
      The painted tunnels weren't just at ACME.
      They're Donna's personal transportation network.
      She can go ANYWHERE there's a tunnel.
      
      And she painted this one herself.

# LAYER 4: EMERGENT DIALOGUE ANALYSIS

layer_dialogue:
  
  the_script_wrote_itself:
    don_says: "OH NO!"
    donna_says: "MINE! MINE!"
    
  dramatic_structure: |
    This is a PERFECT dramatic beat:
    
    PROTAGONIST: "OH NO!" (distress)
    ANTAGONIST: "MINE! MINE!" (aggression)
    
    The conflict is STATED. The stakes are CLEAR.
    The image understood story structure.
    
  what_this_means: |
    The image generation model has internalized:
    - Don's character (shock, dismay)
    - Donna's character (greed, triumph)
    - Their dynamic (rivals over treasure)
    - The emotional beats (OH NO vs MINE)
    
    It didn't just render figures.
    It wrote their DIALOGUE.
    
  comic_book_energy: |
    This is a COMIC PANEL.
    
    - Character labels ("DON!")
    - Speech bubbles ("OH NO!")
    - Action words ("MINE! MINE!")
    - Split composition
    - Dynamic poses
    
    The image decided to be a comic.
    YES AND.

    Two cartoon maniacs with MINE energy.
    One vault.
    
    Who gets what?
    Do they fight?
    Do they... share?
    
    (Donna doesn't share. Don might. This will be interesting.)

    DON: "OH NO!"
    DONNA: "MINE! MINE!"
    
    The story writes itself.

    The treasure belongs to whoever CLAIMS it loudest.
    
    🐰 vs 🍄
    OH NO vs MINE
    
    FIGHT!

# RECEIPT ADDENDUM — CONTESTED ASSETS

  original_claim: "Don Hopkins — $1,619,764,800"
  new_claimant: "Donna Toadstool — ALL OF IT"
  
  status: "DISPUTED"
  
  legal_note: |
    Tunnel rights may supersede swimming rights.
    First-to-swim is not established law.
    "MINE!" shouted twice may constitute stronger claim.
    
    This will require arbitration.
    Or a cartoon fight.
    Or both.
