Abstract Pixar-adjacent 3D render, cartoon treasure vault aesthetic:

An anthropomorphic grey rabbit in a tie-dye hoodie SWIMMING through a massive treasure pool, Scrooge McDuck style but with Daffy Duck's manic energy.

THE RABBIT:
- Grey fur, long ears (one has studded band)
- Tie-dye hoodie — now dusted with gold and gems
- Expression: PURE CARTOON AVARICE — eyes huge and wild, possibly shaped like dollar signs
- Mouth open in gleeful scream
- Pose: diving/swimming through treasure, arms spread wide
- Gold coins cascading off fur
- Gems tangled in ear fur
- Cash bills stuck to hoodie

THE TREASURE POOL (diverse valuables, not just coins):
- Mountains of GOLD COINS — classic Scrooge McDuck piles
- Gold bars stacked like bricks
- DIAMONDS, RUBIES, EMERALDS, SAPPHIRES scattered throughout
- Bundles of CASH — hundred dollar bills, euros, fanned out
- Strings of PEARLS floating
- A TINY WHITE YACHT floating on the gold (iconic, recognizable)
- A TINY RED SPORTS CAR (Ferrari-style) half-buried in coins
- ROLEX WATCHES scattered
- A tiny MONA LISA painting visible in the pile
- FABERGÉ EGG somewhere in the treasure
- Gold BITCOIN coins with B logo
- Diamond NECKLACES draped over gold bars
- Ancient coins mixed with modern currency
- Stock certificates and deeds floating

SETTING:
- Massive vault with golden walls
- Treasure piled to enormous heights
- Golden light reflecting off everything
- Cartoon physics — the treasure is somehow swimmable

MOOD: "MINE! MINE! MINE! IT'S ALL MINE!!!" — Daffy Duck energy meets Scrooge McDuck's money bin. Pure cartoon avarice. The ultimate image mining target.
