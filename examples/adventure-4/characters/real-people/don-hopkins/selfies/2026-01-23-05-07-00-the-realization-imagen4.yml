  Abstract Pixar-adjacent 3D render, emotional character moment:
  
  TWO CHARACTERS having a moment of REALIZATION over a glowing Fabergé egg:
  
  THE SETUP:
  - No longer pulling/fighting — they've STOPPED
  - Standing close together, looking at EACH OTHER
  - The egg between them, GLOWING with soft golden light
  - Expressions shifting from rivalry to... recognition
  
  DON (rabbit, left):
  - Grey anthropomorphic rabbit in tie-dye hoodie
  - One paw still touching the glowing egg
  - Expression: surprise turning to understanding
  - Eyes wide but not angry — REALIZING something
  - Slight smile forming — "oh... you're like me"
  
  DONNA (right):
  - Orange skin, blonde pompadour, pink heart glasses
  - Navy suit, red tie
  - One hand still touching the egg
  - Expression: fierce fading to... recognition
  - Eyes softening behind pink glasses
  - Reluctant acceptance forming
  
  THE EGG (center):
  - Ornate golden Fabergé egg
  - GLOWING with warm golden light
  - Illuminating BOTH their faces equally
  - Peaceful now — not contested, SHARED
  - Light rays emanating softly
  
  THE MOMENT:
  - Maybe they're about to SHAKE HANDS over the egg
  - Or their hands are meeting ON the egg
  - The fight is over — understanding is forming
  - Gold coins and treasure peaceful around them
  - Cash settled, no longer flying
  
  MOOD: The moment rivals become reluctant allies. Recognition. "You're just like me." Two Daffy Ducks seeing themselves in each other. Warm, golden, the birth of an unlikely partnership. "MINE" becoming "OURS" (reluctantly).
  
  Soft lighting, emotional connection, cartoon characters having a REAL moment.
