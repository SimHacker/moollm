Abstract Pixar-adjacent 3D render, dramatic cartoon confrontation:

SPLIT SCENE — Two characters in a treasure vault having a dramatic standoff:

LEFT SIDE — DON (the rabbit):
- Grey anthropomorphic rabbit in gold-dusted tie-dye hoodie
- Mid-swim in treasure pile, NOW FROZEN IN SHOCK
- Expression: eyes wide, mouth agape, "OH NO" energy
- Gold coins and gems cascading around him
- One paw reaching toward a Fabergé egg
- Still has pearls and gems tangled in fur

RIGHT SIDE — DONNA (the nemesis, JUST ARRIVED):
- Flamboyant cartoon character with orange skin, elaborate blonde pompadour
- Navy blue suit, red tie, pink heart-shaped glasses
- Multiple mushroom pins on lapel
- BURSTING THROUGH an orange/black spiral tunnel vortex
- Arms spread wide in triumphant arrival
- Expression: HUGE GRIN, eyes gleaming with treasure lust
- PHONE IN HAND — already taking selfie of her entrance
- Pose: dynamic, claiming the space, theatrical

THE TUNNEL:
- Orange and black swirling spiral (ACME tunnel colors)
- Still active, vortex energy behind Donna
- She painted this tunnel herself — she OWNS it

THE TREASURE BETWEEN THEM:
- Mountains of gold coins
- The contested Fabergé egg (both reaching for it!)
- Mona Lisa painting visible
- Red Ferrari, white yacht
- Cash bundles scattered
- Diamonds, gems everywhere

MOOD: Cartoon rivalry! Two treasure maniacs meeting! "MINE!" vs "MINE!" Drama! Theatrical! Both characters with MAXIMUM cartoon avarice energy. 

The moment of: "YOU THOUGHT YOU COULD SWIM IN TREASURE WITHOUT ME?!"
