Abstract Pixar-adjacent 3D render, stylized cartoon aesthetic:

Anthropomorphic grey rabbit taking a bathroom mirror selfie. Confident smirk, owns his look completely.

OUTFIT - THE SYNTHESIS:
- Tie-dye hoodie in purple/blue/orange spirals (Grateful Dead aesthetic)
- Safety pins decorating the seams (punk addition)
- Hand-stitched black patches with white text: "DEBUG AS FEATURE"
- Red anarchist-style patch on sleeve
- Worn combat boots with TIE-DYE LACES (the key synthesis detail)

ACCESSORIES:
- Studded leather band wrapped around ONE ear only (asymmetric, punk)
- Subtle smudged eyeliner on rabbit eyes (Siouxsie meets Bugs Bunny)
- One ear standing up alert, one flopped relaxed (asymmetric energy)

POSE:
- Peace sign with one paw
- Devil horns (rock gesture) with the other paw
- Both gestures at once — hippie AND punk

SETTING:
- Pub bathroom mirror
- Harsh fluorescent lighting
- Background: graffiti'd wall, band stickers, punk venue energy
- Slightly steamy mirror

MOOD: Confident self-expression, joy in transformation, "I own this now" energy, playful defiance, warm punk aesthetic

Character has just accepted a major transformation and is now STYLING it — making it his own. Pride without arrogance. Punk without anger. Hippie without passivity. THE SYNTHESIS.
