TWO CHARACTERS in intense standoff over a FABERGÉ EGG:

LEFT — DON (rabbit):
- Grey anthropomorphic rabbit in tie-dye hoodie
- Both paws GRIPPING one side of ornate Fabergé egg
- Leaning BACK, pulling with all strength
- Expression: determined, teeth gritted, "IT'S MINE!"
- Feet braced against gold coins
- Pearls still around neck from earlier

RIGHT — DONNA:
- Flamboyant character with orange skin, blonde pompadour
- Navy suit, red tie, pink heart-shaped glasses
- Both hands GRIPPING other side of same egg
- Leaning BACK, pulling opposite direction
- Expression: equally fierce, "NO IT'S MINE!"
- Mushroom pins visible

THE EGG (CENTER):
- Ornate green and gold Fabergé Imperial Egg
- Being PULLED from both sides
- Possibly slightly stretched (cartoon physics)
- Glowing/sparkling from the strain
- THE PRIZE they're fighting over

THE CHAOS:
- Gold coins SCATTERING from their struggle
- Gems flying through the air
- Cash bills swirling around them
- Motion lines showing the pulling force
- Orange/black tunnel still visible behind Donna
- Treasure pile disturbed by their battle
