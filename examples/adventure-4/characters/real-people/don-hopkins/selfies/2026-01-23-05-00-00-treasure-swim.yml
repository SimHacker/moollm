  context: |
    After documenting the image mining pun in the skill docs,
    Don felt an irresistible urge to EMBODY the concept.
    
    Somewhere between Daffy Duck's treasure cave lust
    and Scrooge McDuck's swimming pool full of gold,
    there exists THE ULTIMATE MINING TARGET:
    
    A vault containing EVERY kind of valuable thing.
    And Don is going to swim in it.
    
  inspiration:
    daffy_duck:
      film: "Ali Baba Bunny (1957)"
      moment: "Eyes become dollar signs, dives into gold"
      quote: "IT'S MINE! I'M RICH! I'M A HAPPY MISER!"

      activity: "Swimming through gold coins"
      physics: "Cartoon — coins are somehow liquid"
      
    synthesis: |
      Daffy's GREED + Scrooge's SWIMMING = Don's MINING
      The treasure pool is the ultimate image to mine.
      Meta-recursive: mining an image OF mining.
