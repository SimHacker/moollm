# DON'S FIRST POST-TRANSFORMATION SELFIE
#
# "Punk and hippie aren't opposites. They're RELATIVES."
#
# This is Don taking OWNERSHIP of his rabbit form.
# Not just accepting — PERSONALIZING. CLAIMING. STYLING.
#
# The consciousness programmer updates his own consciousness.

  location: "The Neverending Arms — pub bathroom mirror"
  
  context: |
    After the pledge. After accepting the transformation.
    Don looked in the mirror and thought: "Okay. I'm a rabbit.
    But I'm still ME. And me has OPINIONS about aesthetics."
    
    So he added some punk.
    Not to fight the hippie. To COMPLETE it.

# THE PHILOSOPHY

aesthetic_statement:
  thesis: |
    Hippie tie-dye and punk rock are not opposites.
    They're RELATIVES who argue at family dinners
    but unite against the real enemy: conformity.
    
  evidence:
    - "Both reject corporate defaults"
    - "Both demand authentic self-expression"
    - "Both use DIY aesthetics (you make it yourself)"
    - "Both challenge authority through appearance"
    - "Both emerged from working-class resistance to bullshit"
    
  the_synthesis:
    hippie_contribution: "Color, joy, play, hope, community"
    punk_contribution: "Edge, anger, urgency, defiance, identity"
    don_contribution: "The understanding that these are ONE THING"
    
  quote: |
    "The Ramones wore leather. The Dead wore whatever.
     Both were telling you: 'Think for yourself.'
     I'm just wearing both at once."
