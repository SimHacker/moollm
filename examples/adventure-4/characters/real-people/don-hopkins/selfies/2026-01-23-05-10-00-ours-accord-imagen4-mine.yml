# THE PERFECT SELFIE

layer_composition:
  
  format: "Classic partnership selfie"
  photographer: "Donna Toadstool"
  mood: "Triumphant alliance"
  
  positioning:
    don: "Left, slightly behind"
    donna: "Right, holding phone high"

# DON'S ACCEPTANCE

  appearance:
    form: "Grey rabbit"
    outfit: "Tie-dye hoodie — THE CONSTANT"
    expression: "Slight smile — ACCEPTANCE achieved"

  pose:
    gesture: "PEACE SIGN — his signature"
    body: "Leaning in for the photo"
    energy: "Awkward but willing"
    
  inner_state: |
    Don didn't want a partner.
    Don didn't want to share.
    Don didn't want to be in a selfie.
    
    But here he is.
    Peace sign up.
    Slight smile on.
    
    Because sometimes OURS is okay.
    And because Donna wouldn't take no for an answer.

    Donna LOVES this.
    
    - She got the treasure (half)
    - She got a partner (useful)
    - She got the selfie (eternal documentation)
    - She's going to POST this (OPSEC? What OPSEC?)
    
    Peak Donna energy.

# THE ACCESSORIES

  the_phone:
    type: "iPhone (or equivalent)"
    case: "BEDAZZLED — covered in rhinestones/diamonds"
    sparkle: "Visible light glinting off the gems"
    significance: |
      Donna's phone is AS EXPENSIVE as her taste.
      Of COURSE it's bedazzled.
      Of COURSE it sparkles.
      
      The phone that documented every OPSEC violation
      is itself a statement piece.
      
  mushroom_pins:
    count: "2-3 visible"
    style: "Red cap with white spots — classic toadstool"

      Donna Toadstool wears her name.
      The mushroom pins are her BRAND.
      
      In every render, the pins appear.
      Sometimes more, sometimes fewer.
      But always PRESENT.

# DONNA'S POST

  caption: |
    From MINE to OURS. 
    Found my co-miner. 
    
    He's a rabbit now but he gets it.
    We both get it.
    
    $1.6 billion is better with someone 
    who understands the MINE energy.
