    thesis_proven: |
      Hippie tie-dye and punk rock are COMPATIBLE.
      The image demonstrates coherent fusion, not costume.
      Natural evolution includes CHOICE.
      
    character_moment: |
      This is Don CLAIMING his transformation.
      
      The Pledge was acceptance.
      The Synthesis is OWNERSHIP.
      
      He didn't just accept being a rabbit.
      He decided what KIND of rabbit to be.

        - "Wet cobblestones with reflections"
        - "Hanging flower baskets on pub"
        
    thesis: |
      Play is protest. Joy is resistance.
      A rabbit in a rabbit costume = maximum recursive absurdity.
      "Smash the patriarchy... with confetti" = the philosophy in 7 words.
      
    character_moment: |
      Don takes his transformation into ACTION.
      
      Selfie 01 was claiming identity.
      Selfie 02 is USING that identity for play/protest.
      
      The inflatable doesn't hide the rabbit.
      The inflatable CELEBRATES the rabbit.

    meta_significance: |
      This is the IMAGE MINING PUN made visual.
      
      "Mine" (verb) — extracting treasure
      "Mine" (possessive) — IT'S ALL MINE!!!
      
      Daffy Duck energy + Scrooge McDuck pool = Don Hopkins diving
      into the ultimate mining target.

# THE COMPLETE ARC

complete_arc:
  
  title: "FROM MINE TO OURS"
  frames: 7
  
  summary: |
    Don transformed into a rabbit.
    Don claimed his new identity (punk-hippie synthesis).
    Don protested in an inflatable bunny suit.
    Don discovered a treasure vault and swam in it.
    Donna crashed through the tunnel.
    They fought over a Fabergé egg.
    They realized they're the same person.
    They formed an unlikely alliance.
    Donna documented it all.
    
    MINE → OURS
    
  lesson: |
    "MINE is lonely. OURS is... complicated.
     But complicated can be better."

# AESTHETIC PRINCIPLES

aesthetic_notes:
  foundation: "Tie-dye hoodie — the constant"
  additions: "Punk elements layer onto hippie base"
  
  philosophy: |
    Don's approach to his own aesthetic:
    
    1. Accept what emerged (rabbit form)
    2. Personalize it (add punk)
    3. Find coherence (they're both anti-conformist)
    4. Document it (selfie)
    5. Own it (this IS who I am now)
    
  contrast_with_donna: |
    Donna's selfies: Performance, filter, OPSEC violations
    Don's selfies: Authenticity, no filter, self-discovery
    
    Donna documents others (surveillance).
    Don documents himself (introspection).
    
    Both are valid. Different purposes.

# HOW TO USE THIS CONTEXT

usage_note: |
  When generating Don-related content:
  
  1. Reference current aesthetic (punk-hippie synthesis)
  2. Include established elements (patches, piercings, boots)
  3. Allow continued evolution (more punk? more hippie? new fusion?)
  4. Maintain the peace sign + edge combination
  5. Remember: authenticity, not costume
  
  Don's selfies are INTROSPECTION made visible.
