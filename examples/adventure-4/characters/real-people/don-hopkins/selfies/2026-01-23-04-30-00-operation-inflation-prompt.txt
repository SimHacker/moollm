Abstract Pixar-adjacent 3D render, joyful protest aesthetic:

An anthropomorphic grey rabbit wearing a PINK INFLATABLE BUNNY COSTUME — the big puffy silly kind with an air-filled round body and oversized floppy ears.

THE META MOMENT:
- Real grey rabbit face visible through the costume's face hole
- Real grey rabbit ears POKING UP THROUGH the pink inflatable costume ears
- A rabbit IN a rabbit costume — the recursion is intentional
- Subtle eyeliner still visible on real face

THE COSTUME:
- Classic pink inflatable bunny — round puffy body
- Giant pink floppy ears (with real grey ears visible inside/through)
- Silly buck teeth on the costume face
- Stubby inflatable arms raised in celebration
- Slightly deflating on one side (authentic protest wear)

ACCESSORIES:
- Hand-drawn cardboard protest sign: "PLAY IS PROTEST"
- Tie-dye combat boots visible underneath the inflatable
- Maybe a punk patch safety-pinned to the costume

SETTING:
- Cobblestone street at night outside a cozy pub
- Warm street lamp lighting, pub windows glowing
- Background: another protester in inflatable T-Rex costume
- Background: another in inflatable FROG costume (Frog Brigade!)
- Background: older bearded man (Richard) with pint, looking bemused

EXPRESSION:
- PURE JOY — huge genuine smile, eyes crinkled
- Not performing — FEELING the absurdist happiness
- This is play as protest, joy as resistance

MOOD: Joyful political absurdity, Operation Inflation energy, Portland Frog Brigade spirit, recursive identity humor, play is protest, de-escalation through silliness, party as demonstration
