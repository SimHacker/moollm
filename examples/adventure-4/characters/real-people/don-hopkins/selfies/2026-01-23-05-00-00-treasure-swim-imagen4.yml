  Abstract Pixar-adjacent 3D render, cartoon treasure vault aesthetic:
  
  An anthropomorphic grey rabbit in a tie-dye hoodie SWIMMING through a massive treasure pool, Scrooge McDuck style but with Daffy Duck's manic energy.
  
  THE RABBIT:
  - Grey fur, long ears (one has studded band)
  - Tie-dye hoodie — now dusted with gold and gems
  - Expression: PURE CARTOON AVARICE — eyes huge and wild, possibly shaped like dollar signs
  - Mouth open in gleeful scream
  - Pose: diving/swimming through treasure, arms spread wide
  - Gold coins cascading off fur
  - Gems tangled in ear fur
  - Cash bills stuck to hoodie
  
  THE TREASURE POOL (diverse valuables, not just coins):
  - Mountains of GOLD COINS — classic Scrooge McDuck piles
  - Gold bars stacked like bricks
  - DIAMONDS, RUBIES, EMERALDS, SAPPHIRES scattered throughout
  - Bundles of CASH — hundred dollar bills, euros, fanned out
  - Strings of PEARLS floating
  - A TINY WHITE YACHT floating on the gold (iconic, recognizable)
  - A TINY RED SPORTS CAR (Ferrari-style) half-buried in coins
  - ROLEX WATCHES scattered
  - A tiny MONA LISA painting visible in the pile
  - FABERGÉ EGG somewhere in the treasure
  - Gold BITCOIN coins with B logo
  - Diamond NECKLACES draped over gold bars
  - Ancient coins mixed with modern currency
  - Stock certificates and deeds floating
  
  SETTING:
  - Massive vault with golden walls
  - Treasure piled to enormous heights
  - Golden light reflecting off everything
  - Cartoon physics — the treasure is somehow swimmable
  
  MOOD: "MINE! MINE! MINE! IT'S ALL MINE!!!" — Daffy Duck energy meets Scrooge McDuck's money bin. Pure cartoon avarice. The ultimate image mining target.
