  context: |
    Don was having the time of his life.
    Swimming in $1.6 billion of treasure.
    MINE MINE MINE echoing off the golden walls.
    
    Then: a RUMBLING.
    
    The painted tunnel on the vault wall — the one Don
    assumed was decorative — began to SWIRL.
    
    And through it burst DONNA TOADSTOOL.
    
    Pink glasses. Mushroom pins. Phone already out.
    Already taking a selfie of her dramatic entrance.
    
    "SURPRISE, BUNNY BOY!"

      - "Those tunnels? I PAINTED THEM!"
      - "ALL OF THIS IS MINE NOW!"
      - "*already posting selfie* #VaultCrash #TreasureQueen"
      
  dynamic: |
    Two cartoon maniacs.
    One treasure vault.
    Both screaming MINE MINE MINE.
    
    This is going to get MESSY.

# TREASURE DIVISION CONFLICT

  don_claim: "I was here FIRST!"
  donna_claim: "I BUILT the tunnel network!"
  
  contested_items:
    mona_lisa: "BOTH want it"
    faberge_egg: "BOTH reaching for it"
    bitcoin: "Donna: 'Crypto is MINE'"
    yacht: "Don: 'I already named it!'"
    ferrari: "Donna: 'Red matches my tie!'"
    
  escalation: |
    Neither will back down.
    Both have Daffy Duck energy.
    The treasure pile is about to become a BATTLEFIELD.
    
    Or... an unlikely alliance?
    
    There's enough treasure for two.
    But MINE MINE MINE doesn't share easily.
