# OTHER PLANNED FILMS

other_films:

  slats_reproduction:
    title: "Untitled Reproduction Film"
    star: "Slats"
    premise: |
      After being fired as a waiter, Slats decided
      his one true goal in life was to REPRODUCE HIMSELF.
      
      "Speed Dating meets Demon Seed."
      
      Slats approaches strangers in Berkeley,
      asking for their genetic material.
      
    finding: |
      It turns out to be a lot easier for a robot
      to talk a man out of his sperm
      than to talk a woman out of her eggs.
      
    status: "Filmed but not produced for broadcast"
    
  # [SKELETON — Other films TBD from Don's memory]

# WHY THEY NEVER AIRED

why_never_aired: |
  Contractual problems between NBC and SAG (Screen Actors Guild).
  
  The humans in the films were real unsuspecting people.
  They weren't actors. They weren't paid. They didn't sign releases upfront.
  
  SAG rules about using non-actors became complicated.
  The legal issues couldn't be resolved.
  
  The footage exists.
  The experiments succeeded.
  The broadcast didn't happen.
  
  But the robots remember.
  And Don has the footage.
  
# LEGACY

legacy: |
  The One Minute Movies were ahead of their time.
  
  Hidden camera + AI + social experiment + one-minute format.
  
  Before viral videos. Before YouTube (founded 2005).
  Before "Will It Blend?" Before "What Would You Do?"
  
  Will Wright and Don Hopkins were testing:
  - Human reactions to artificial beings
  - Empathy thresholds for machines
  - The uncanny valley in real life
  - What it takes to get a 10
  
  The footage lives on YouTube now.
  View counts are low.
  But the questions they asked still matter.
