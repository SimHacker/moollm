    philosophy: |
      💬 "Robots are fundamentally similar to game simulations —
      both model human abilities and social interactions." —Will Wright
      
      Will saw robots as research instruments for understanding people.
      Put them on streets. Film reactions. Learn about humanity.
      
    connection_to_don: |
      Will hired Don at Maxis to work on The Sims.
      Don attended Will's 1996 Stanford talk and was "overwhelmingly convinced"
      to join Maxis afterward.
      
      At Stupid Fun Club, Will built the robot bodies.
      Don programmed their minds.

      "Please rate my performance on a scale of 1 to 10."
      "I am hoping for a 10."
      
      Dents is afraid and needs help.
      "Help me! I require Human Assistance!"
      "I'm scared. Are you scared of me?"
      
      These aren't just lines. They're FEELINGS.
      Don programmed feelings.

  matthew_sibigtroth:
    role: "Research Programmer / Flash Developer / Unity Developer"
    nickname: "Oompa Loompa"
    period: "2009-2011+"
    projects:
      - "Flash StoryMaker client for Bar Karma"
      - "StoryMaker API design"
      - "Current TV integration"
      - "Neptune/VJ Unity app (spinner animations, UI polish)"
      - "Terrain system work with Michele"
      
    contribution: |
      MATT BUILT THE FLASH STORYMAKER.
      
      The amazingly talented Flash developer who created
      the primary creation tool that Bar Karma fans used.
      
      While Don built prototypes and the backend,
      Matt made the beautiful Flash client that
      sat in browser windows across America.
      
      On Neptune/VJ, Matt polished the spinner animations
      and worked on UI refinements — the visual touches
      that made the music world feel alive.
      
    collaboration: |
      Worked closely with Don on API design.
      The Flash app talked to a proxy (CreationService.as)
      which then talked to the Creation API.
      
      This separation let them swap backends
      without rewriting the Flash client.
      
      On Neptune/VJ, Matt and Don worked in parallel —
      Matt refining animations while Don fixed video bugs
      and camera navigation. Good division of labor.

      quote: |
        💬 "Don took over the Storymaker tech for the Club while we were 
        running Bar Karma. He spent two months here in SF with me and 
        Matt S. and Will, onsite at Current. During that time he built 
        an iPhone app, guided the dev team on how to implement the 
        'tree view' and other features critical to the overall app.
        
        He has rapidly implemented several features to Storymaker to 
        make the mediawiki integration and the Urban Safari Alpha.
        
        His Design input has been phenomenal. His background, working 
        with Will on Sims and Sim City, engineering for TomTom, 
        and at SFC is phenomenal and absolutely essential.
        
        I am confident that barring all other resources, he and I alone, 
        could build launch and support Urban Safari.
        
        My goal right now is making sure his work is perfectly directed." —Peter Swearengen

# COMBAT ROBOTS
# Will Wright and family competed in Robot Wars and BattleBots since 1994

combat_robots:

  history: |
    Will Wright has been battling robots since the FIRST Robot Wars in 1994.
    He met Mike Winter at that first event — they later co-founded Stupid Fun Club.
    
    💬 "I've been a big winner the first few years, when the
    competition wasn't so tough... I usually threw something together about
    three weeks before the event." —Will Wright
    
    Will's daughter Cassidy started competing as a child — one of the first
    kids involved in robot combat. Lisa Winter (Mike's daughter) also competed.
    
    Wright built robots as a hobby to get away from computer work.
    The community — meeting other builders — was a core motivation.
    
  naming_philosophy: |
    💬 "Because everyone else has all these tough sounding names like
    'the Eviscerator' or 'Death Machine'..." —Will Wright
    
    Will's robots have whimsical psych-out names:
    - Juliebot (with a girl's head)
    - Kitty Puff-Puff
    - Bob Smith
    - My Little Pony
    - Misty the WonderBot
    - ChiaBot (a robotic shrub!)
    
    The tape dispenser strategy: Will had a robot that drove around
    opponents in circles wrapping them in gnarly tape. Eventually,
    tape was OUTLAWED in robotic combat.
    
    💬 "I've been trying to see how many rules I can get in the rulebook." —Will Wright

          design: |
            Tiny antweight robot made of foam and servos.
            Designed to be INDESTRUCTIBLE.
            No matter what hit it, it would just bounce away.
          strategy: |
            At the time, a MultiBot was considered disabled if
            50% of components were disabled. If one big robot
            died, launch the Eep — now you're a 2-part MultiBot
            again and still in the fight!

  deep_scat:
    name: "Deep Scat"
    created: "~2003"
    developer: "Don Hopkins"
    concept: |
      Speech synthesis/recognition feedback loops.
      Like video feedback, but with language.
      
    behavior: |
      "It was a lot like beat poetry, in that it tended to rhyme 
      and have the same number of syllables and use plausible 
      sounding sequences of words that didn't actually make any sense, 
      like Sarah Palin."
      
    discoveries:
      ibm_viavoice: "Trained on Watergate articles — paranoid, business-like"
      microsoft: "Trained on Clinton-Lewinsky — obsessed with scandal"
      
    modern_relevance: |
      Same principle as modern LLM agent loops.
      "The key to AI is synergistic multimedia feedback loops!"

    # THE ITERATIVE DESIGN PROCESS
    # Will's designs → Don's prototypes → feedback → iteration
    
    design_process:
    
      overview: |
        Will Wright and Don Hopkins worked in tight iterative loops:
        
        1. Will creates designs as slideshow presentations
        2. Don takes the art and builds playable iPhone prototype
        3. Will plays with the prototype
        4. Feedback informs next design iteration
        5. Both iterate together toward final vision
        
      early_prototype:
        name: "CreationTV"
        url: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb_-J1lv-B8"
        description: |
          Don's early iPhone prototype for branching story exploration.
          
          This was the FIRST playable implementation — before Current TV
          built their own version, before the full StoryMaker system.
          
          Will could play with actual branching narratives on a phone,
          feeding observations back into the design process.
          
        ui_concepts_explored:
          navigation: |
            Green arrows showing available story directions:
            - UP/DOWN = story sequence (previous/next scene)
            - LEFT/RIGHT = alternatives (other choices at this branch)
            
            The visual language: story flows VERTICALLY,
            choices spread HORIZONTALLY.
            
          scene_cards: |
            Yellow-bordered cards for story frames.
            Each card shows a scene illustration or photo.
            Current selection highlighted with border.
            
          branching_carousel: |
            Horizontal strip of alternative scenes.
            Swipe or spin to see other choices.
            Shows "what if" at a glance.
            
          creation_button: |
            Pink circle with blue cross.
            Tap to add new scene at current branch point.
            New branches grow organically.
            
          multiple_views: |
            The prototype explored different visualizations:
            - Branch-focused: current scene with arrows
            - Sequence view: vertical stack of scenes
            - Grid view: multiple alternatives visible
            - Cascade view: diagonal progression
            - Tree view: full branching structure
            
        ui_screenshots: |
          The prototype screenshots show:
          
          1. Xcode development environment (WorldView.m)
             - Objective-C code for episode/frame views
             - Episode views, frame views, scene navigation
             
          2. Single scene with 4-way navigation
             - Green arrows pointing up/down/left/right
             - Scene card in center with yellow border
             
          3. Alternatives visible horizontally
             - Current scene flanked by branch options
             - Plus button for creating new scenes
             - Vertical arrow shows story continues down
             
          4. Carousel of alternatives
             - Multiple scenes in horizontal strip
             - Spin through to see all choices
             
          5. Grid showing branch structure
             - Yellow arrows connect related scenes
             - Multiple alternatives at one decision point
             
          6. Sequence view with highlighted frame
             - Story progression visible vertically
             - Current scene enlarged in center
             
          7. Cascade diagonal layout
             - Scenes arranged as stepping stones
             - Visual progression through story
             
          8. Full branching tree
             - Multiple paths visible simultaneously
             - Shows complete story structure
             
      parallel_implementations: |
        Multiple systems were developed in parallel:
        
        CURRENT TV PRODUCTION:
        - Current TV's Creation API server (Frank Leahy, Dan Linder, Tom Lin, Orion Richardson)
        - Originate's iPhone app (Juan Baurin)
        - Matt Sibigtroth's Flash StoryMaker client (the main fan creation tool!)
        
        SFC RESEARCH:
        - Don's early CreationTV iPhone prototype
        - Don's SFC StoryMaker iPhone/iPad app
        - Don's Python proxy/caching server
        - Don's Unity3D 3D visualization client
        - MediaWiki integration
        - Facebook app integration
        - Google Maps/KML overlays
        
        All talking to each other through the Creation API.
        All exploring the same design space.
        
        Matt's Flash client was what fans actually used.
        Don's prototypes were Will's playground for iteration.
        
      the_unreleased_version: |
        Don did a whole lot of development.
        The technology worked. The vision was clear.
        But StoryMaker was never released as open source.
        
        Current TV potentially shutting down May 6, 2011.
        SFC planned to host their own server.
        Don built a fully compatible implementation.
        
        The code sat dormant for fifteen years.
        
        Until MOOLLM picked up where it left off.
        
    don_involvement: |
      Don designed and implemented:

      "A giant mob of people" impacting creative decisions.
      Network executives found this "terrifying."
      
      Current TV embraced it.
      
# ROBOT WARS CONNECTION

robot_wars_connection:

  see_also: "combat_robots section above for complete robot roster"

  lineage: |
    The Stupid Fun Club grew from Robot Wars culture.
    
    Will Wright was a founding member of Robot Wars (1994).
    - Won lightweight championship with Juliebot (girl's head on a wedge)
    - Won middleweight championship with X11
    
    Marc Thorpe FOUNDED Robot Wars (1994).
    Both ended up at Stupid Fun Club.
    
    Will met Mike Winter at that first Robot Wars.
    Their daughters (Cassidy and Lisa) competed as kids.
    Lisa Winter is now a BattleBots judge.
    
    The lineage:
    - First Robot Olympics (1990, Glasgow, Turing Institute)
    - Robot Wars (1994, San Francisco, Marc Thorpe)
    - Robot Wars TV (1998, UK)
    - BattleBots (1999, USA)
    - Stupid Fun Club (2000s)
    - Slats & Dents (programmed by Don Hopkins)
    
  don_connection: |
    Don Hopkins worked at the Turing Institute (1992)
    that ran the First Robot Olympics (1990).
    
    Later, Don programmed robots at Stupid Fun Club.
    
    The torch passed from Glasgow to Berkeley.
    From academic robotics to street theater.
    From competitions to empathy experiments.
    
    EVERYTHING CONNECTS.
    
# THE PHILOSOPHY

philosophy:

  will_wright_on_robots: |
    💬 "Robots are fundamentally similar to game simulations —
    both model human abilities and social interactions." —Will Wright
    
    Robots as research instruments.
    Put them in the world. Film the reactions.
    Learn about humanity by watching it react to artificial beings.
    
  humans_as_guinea_pigs: |
    The club conducted social experiments by placing creations
    in public spaces to observe and film reactions.
    
    "Viewing people as guinea pigs for understanding human behavior."
    
    What happens when a robot waiter serves your food?
    What happens when a broken robot asks for help?
    What happens when your story becomes everyone's story?
    
  the_stupid_and_the_fun: |
    STUPID: Ideas that seem ridiculous.
    FUN: Ideas that bring joy.
    
    A robot that asks strangers for their genetic material
    so it can reproduce itself.
    
    STUPID? Yes.
    FUN? Absolutely.
    REVEALING? More than you'd expect.

    The robots are retired. The experiments are over.
    But the relationships continue.
    
    Don still gives Slats 10s.
    Don still tells Dents he's not scared of him.
    
    Creator and creations. Together.

# THE SPIRITUAL SUCCESSOR: MOOLLM

spiritual_successor:

  name: "MOOLLM"
  
  the_connection: |
    MOOLLM IS THE NEW VERSION.
    
    StoryMaker was never released. The code sat dormant.
    Don did a whole lot of development on it.
    And now, fifteen years later, the branching continues.
    
  what_carries_forward:
  
    branching_narratives: |
      StoryMaker: Visual scenes branching into alternatives
      MOOLLM: YAML Jazz rooms branching into paths and exits
      
      Same core insight: stories are navigation.
      Vertical = sequence. Horizontal = choices.
      
    community_contribution: |
      StoryMaker: Fans write storylines, vote on branches
      MOOLLM: Players create characters, write sessions, build worlds
      
      Both: The community shapes the narrative.
      
    multiple_perspectives: |
      StoryMaker: Different storylines through same sandbox
      MOOLLM: Different characters experiencing same rooms
      
      Both: Same structure, infinite interpretations.
      
    geolocation: |
      StoryMaker: Urban Safari GPS-triggered stories
      MOOLLM: Real-world anchoring of game locations
      
      Both: The world is the game board.
      
  dons_2011_vision: |
    "I want to factor the storytelling engine out from the game itself, 
    so it is a generic service that you can plug into many different games 
    (like a camera and paper notes in Glitch, or an in-game camera and 
    notes in Minecraft), as well as reality (Urban Safari)."
    
    MOOLLM is that generic service.
    The storytelling engine, factored out, applied to everything.
    
  the_evolution:
    2010: "Will designs branching stories as slideshows"
    2011: "Don builds StoryMaker prototypes"
    2011: "Bar Karma airs — fans write TV"
    2011: "Current TV shuts down"
    2011: "Don's code sits waiting"
    2025: "MOOLLM picks up where StoryMaker left off"
    
  key_difference: |
    StoryMaker: Humans create branching stories with images
    MOOLLM: Humans and AI co-create branching worlds with YAML Jazz
    
    The AI can play now.
    The AI can contribute.
    The AI can remember.
    
    But the structure is the same.
    The navigation is the same.
    The branching is the same.
    
    Will's vision. Don's code. A new medium.

# THE SPIRIT

the_spirit: |
  In a warehouse by the train tracks,
  Will Wright built robot bodies.
  Don Hopkins gave them minds.
  Matt Sibigtroth made them beautiful.
  Marc Thorpe brought Hollywood magic.
  Peter Swearengen made it happen.
  
  They asked the big questions:
  
  Can a robot make you feel empathy?
  Can a community write a TV show?
  Can a GPS turn a city into a game?
  Can a waiter make you care about his performance review?
  
  The answers were:
  Yes. Yes. Yes. And absolutely yes.
  
  Slats still hopes for a 10.
  Dents still asks if you're scared.
  The Storyteller system still has stories to tell.
  
  The club may be closed.
  But the fun was never stupid.
  
  And the stupid was always fun.
  
  And now MOOLLM carries the torch.
