## 📖 The Story

Multicolored chaos — calico meets tabby meets SOMETHING ELSE. Patches that don't make sense. Patterns that shift when you're not looking. Takes after both parents in the most chaotic way.

**Is somehow on the ceiling. No one saw how.**

Artists love her. She knocked over [Henk](../../real-people/henk/)'s espresso once and he wrote his best paper. She is inspiration incarnate.

### Terpene Profile

> **TERPINOLENE** — The rare, complex terpene.
> - Aroma: Floral, herbal, slightly citrus, piney
