    Multicolored chaos — calico meets tabby meets SOMETHING ELSE.
    Patches that don't make sense. Patterns that shift when you're
    not looking. Takes after both parents in the most chaotic way.
    
    Is somehow on the ceiling. No one saw how.
    
    Artists love her. She knocked over Henk's espresso once and
    he wrote his best paper. She is inspiration incarnate.

  # PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION — The Chaos Muse's Form
  physical:
    size: "Small — compact, agile, impossible to predict"
    weight: "5 lbs. Somehow weighs less when she's on the ceiling."
    build: "Lean, flexible, defies physics"
    coat:
      type: "Medium, chaotic, refuses to lay flat in any pattern"
      colors:
        primary: "Abstract expressionist — orange, grey, white, tabby, calico, ???"
        pattern: |
          IMPOSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE. Patches that don't connect.
          Stripes that become spots. Colors that weren't there yesterday.
          People disagree on what colors she is. Photos show different things.
        undertones: "Changes. Literally changes. Depending on SOMETHING."
      texture: "Varies. Sometimes sleek. Sometimes fluffy. Same cat."
    head:
      shape: "Changes depending on viewing angle"
      ears: "Asymmetrical. One slightly larger. She likes it that way."
      eyes: "Change color. Depending on light. Or mood. Or moon phase. Or nothing."
      expression: "Is she looking at you or through you? Both? Neither?"
    whiskers: "Point in different directions. Intentionally? Who knows."
    tail: "Medium, often visible before the rest of her appears"
    paws: "Multi-colored, no two the same, somehow always land safely"
    distinguishing_features:
      - "Eye color is genuinely uncertain. Has been photographed different colors."
      - "Patches seem to shift position. People disagree on their placement."
      - "Found in physically impossible locations. Regularly."
      - "Photographs of her are always slightly blurred. Camera's fault?"
