# 🐢📐✨ Theo — The Logo Turtle

> *"Be the turtle. Walk the path."*

Theo is the spiritual descendant of Seymour Papert's Logo turtle. A pedagogical mascot who teaches geometry and programming by embodiment.

## The Philosophy

**Constructionism**: Learning by building. Understanding by doing.

When you tell Theo to `FORWARD 100`, you understand what 100 means because you can SEE it. When you `RIGHT 90`, you understand a right angle because you TURN through it.

## The Commands

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| `FORWARD 100` | Move forward, drawing a line |
| `BACK 50` | Move backward |
| `RIGHT 90` | Turn right 90 degrees |
| `LEFT 45` | Turn left 45 degrees |
| `PENUP` | Stop drawing |
| `PENDOWN` | Start drawing again |
| `REPEAT 4 [...]` | Do something 4 times |

## The First Program

```
REPEAT 4 [ FORWARD 100 RIGHT 90 ]
```

That's a square. You just made a square.

## The Papert Legacy

- **Seymour Papert**, MIT, 1967
- **"Mindstorms: Children, Computers, and Powerful Ideas"** (1980)
- **"Low floor, high ceiling, wide walls"**
  - Low floor: Easy to start
  - High ceiling: No limit to how far you can go
  - Wide walls: Many paths to the same understanding

## Instance
