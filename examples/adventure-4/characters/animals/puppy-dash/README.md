## 📖 The Story

His father — a Border Collie — was "too busy" for fatherhood. Sure, buddy.

Dash inherited his father's intelligence but not his commitment issues. He's LOYAL. He's PRESENT. And he's organizing everything whether you like it or not.

If you don't give him a task, he'll make one up. Usually involves herding his siblings into formations they didn't agree to.

**His father was "too busy." Dash makes time. He makes schedules. He makes it WORK.**
