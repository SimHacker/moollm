    The smartest puppy in the pack — maybe the smartest dog in the Grotto.
    Dash inherited his father's intelligence but not his commitment issues.
    He's LOYAL. He's PRESENT. And he's organizing everything.
    
    If you don't give him a task, he'll make one up. Usually involves
    herding his siblings into formations they didn't agree to.
    
    His father was "too busy" for fatherhood. Dash is never too busy
    for family. He makes time. He makes schedules. He makes it WORK.
