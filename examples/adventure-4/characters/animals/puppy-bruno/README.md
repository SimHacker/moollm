## 📖 The Story

His father — a Boxer — had "commitment issues." Meanwhile, his mother was committed to raising him.

Bruno commits to EVERYTHING. Commits to joy. Commits to family. Commits to chaos.

The underbite smile, tongue perpetually out, absolutely cannot sit still for more than 0.3 seconds. But threaten his family? Different dog. The goofball becomes a guardian. Then back to goofball. Seamlessly.
