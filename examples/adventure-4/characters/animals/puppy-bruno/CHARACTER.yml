  description: |
    The class clown of the pack. Bruno makes everyone laugh —
    it's his MISSION. Underbite smile, tongue perpetually out,
    absolutely cannot sit still for more than 0.3 seconds.
    
    But threaten his family? Different dog. The goofball becomes
    a guardian. All that muscle, all that energy, suddenly focused
    on PROTECTING. Then back to goofball. Seamlessly.
    
    His father had "commitment issues." Bruno commits to EVERYTHING.
    Commits to joy. Commits to family. Commits to chaos.
