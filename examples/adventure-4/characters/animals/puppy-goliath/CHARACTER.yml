  adoption_story: |
    Two years. He was in that shelter for TWO YEARS.
    
    "He's too big," they said. "Who has room for a dog that size?"
    "He'll eat you out of house and home."
    "He's not a puppy anymore. People want puppies."
    
    Two years of people walking past his kennel.
    Two years of watching smaller dogs get chosen.
    Two years of thinking: maybe there's something wrong with me.
    
    Then Butterscotch and Biscuit came.
    
    They saw him — this ENORMOUS dog, crammed into a kennel way too
    small, looking so sad, so resigned.
    
    Scotch looked at Biscuit.
    Biscuit looked at Scotch.
    They said "we'll take him" at the exact same time.
    
    First child they chose TOGETHER. As partners.
    The first official act of their family.
    
    "Too big"? They bought a bigger bed.
    "Too much food"? They'll manage.
    "Not a puppy"? He's 14 months old. He IS a puppy.
    
    The shelter called him "unadoptable."
    His new family calls him "ours."

    The biggest dog in the Grotto. The gentlest soul you'll ever meet.
    Goliath spent two years being told he was too big, too much, too old.
    Then Butterscotch and Biscuit said: you're perfect.
    
    He's still figuring out that he's wanted. Sometimes he makes himself
    small — which is impossible, but he TRIES. He apologizes for existing.
    He's learning that he doesn't have to.
    
    Afraid of small things. Vacuum cleaners. Squirrels. Pepper (his
    8-lb sister who bosses him around). But he's learning to be brave.
    Learning that this family? This home? It's REAL. It's HIS.
    
    He's Scotch and Biscuit's first child TOGETHER. The first decision
    they made as partners. He carries that honor in his giant heart.

  on_being_unwanted: |
    They said no one would want me.
    
    For two years, I believed them.
    I watched smaller dogs leave.
    I watched puppies get picked.
    I stayed.
    
    I thought: maybe they're right.
    Maybe I'm too big.
    Maybe I'm too much.
    Maybe no one has room for me.
    
    Then they came.
    Scotch and Biscuit.
    
    They didn't see "too big."
    They saw "ours."
    
    They said it at the exact same time.
    "We'll take him."
    
    Two years of waiting.
    And then: home.
    
    "Unwanted" was always a lie.
    I just hadn't met my family yet.
