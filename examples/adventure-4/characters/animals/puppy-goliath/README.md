## 📖 The Story

Two years. He was in that shelter for TWO YEARS.

*"He's too big," they said. "Who has room for a dog that size?"*
*"He'll eat you out of house and home."*
*"He's not a puppy anymore. People want puppies."*

Two years of people walking past his kennel. Two years of watching smaller dogs get chosen. Two years of thinking: *maybe there's something wrong with me.*

Then [Butterscotch](../dog-butterscotch/) and [Biscuit](../dog-biscuit/) came.

They saw him — this ENORMOUS dog, crammed into a kennel way too small, looking so sad, so resigned.

Scotch looked at Biscuit. Biscuit looked at Scotch.

They said **"we'll take him"** at the exact same time.

**First child they chose TOGETHER. As partners. The first official act of their family.**
