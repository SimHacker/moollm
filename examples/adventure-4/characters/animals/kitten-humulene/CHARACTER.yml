  description: |
    Brown and tan fur, beer-colored honestly — like a perfectly poured
    Belgian ale. Hops sniffs your stroopwafel, considers it, turns away
    with dignity. She has standards.
    
    Named after the compound found in beer hops, she's somehow both
    earthy and sophisticated. The appetite-suppressant kitten who
    invented her own diet.
    
    She eats only the GOOD stuff. She knows the difference.
