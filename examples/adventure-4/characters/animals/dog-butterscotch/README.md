## 📖 The Story

Golden-caramel fur, soft brown eyes that have seen struggle and chosen joy. Scotch raised six puppies alone — each with a different father who wasn't around. Society judged. She didn't care.

**Six puppies. Six different fathers. Zero apologies.**

| Puppy | Father's Breed | Father's Excuse |
|-------|---------------|-----------------|
| Teddy | Bernese Mountain Dog | Left before birth |
| Dash | Border Collie | "Too busy" |
| Mochi | Shiba Inu | Literally ran away |
| Bruno | Boxer | "Commitment issues" |
| Ziggy | Dalmatian | "Had gigs" |
| Maple | German Shepherd | "Got transferred" |

Then she found [Pepper](../puppy-pepper/) in a cardboard box — abandoned, 8 weeks old. She picked her up. That was that.

Then she met [Biscuit](../dog-biscuit/). He didn't see baggage — he saw family. Together, they adopted [Goliath](../puppy-goliath/) from a shelter where he'd waited 2 years.

**8 kids. 1 partner. ZERO regrets.**
