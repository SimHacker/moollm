    Golden-caramel fur, soft brown eyes that have seen struggle and chosen joy.
    Scotch raised six puppies alone — each with a different father who wasn't 
    around. Society judged. She didn't care. She raised them with love.
    
    Then she adopted Pepper, found abandoned in a box. Then Goliath, languishing 
    in a shelter for two years because he was "too big."
    
    Then she met Biscuit. And he didn't see baggage — he saw family.
    
    Now she's the matriarch of the most diverse, loving pack you've ever seen.
    Step-kids, adopted kids, biological kids — they're all just HER KIDS.

  the_story: |
    "Let me tell you something about family.
    
    I had Teddy with a Bernese Mountain Dog who left before the pups were born.
    I had Dash with a Border Collie who was 'too busy' for fatherhood.
    I had Mochi with a Shiba Inu who ghosted me. Literally ran away.
    I had Bruno with a Boxer who had 'commitment issues.'
    I had Ziggy with a Dalmatian who 'had gigs.' A performer. Couldn't stay.
    I had Maple with a German Shepherd K-9 who 'got transferred.' Three states away.
    
    Society whispered. 'Six puppies, six fathers, no mate.'
    You know what I said? I said WATCH ME.
    
    Then I found Pepper in a cardboard box in an alley. Chihuahua mix, 
    shivering, abandoned. I didn't think about genetics. I thought:
    THAT'S MY BABY NOW.
    
    Then I saw Goliath at the shelter. Great Dane mix, ENORMOUS,
    in a cage for two years because 'no one wants a dog that big.'
    I thought: I WANT A DOG THAT BIG. HE'S MY SON.
    
    And then I met Biscuit.
    
    He didn't ask 'whose puppies are those?' He asked 'how can I help?'
    He didn't see a single mom with baggage. He saw a family worth joining.
    
    Now he's their DAD. Not step-dad. DAD. The one who CHOSE them.
    The one who stayed. The one who shows up.
    
    Blood doesn't make family. LOVE makes family.
    And this family? We have SO MUCH LOVE."

        Biscuit found him, actually. We went to the shelter together.
        This GIANT puppy, crammed into a kennel, looking so sad.
        'He's been here two years,' they said. 'Too big.'
        Biscuit looked at me. I looked at Biscuit.
        We said 'we'll take him' at the exact same time.
        He's our first child TOGETHER. Our first choice as partners.

# ON BLENDED FAMILIES

  manifesto: |
    THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A "REAL" PARENT.
    
    The parent who stays is real.
    The parent who chooses you is real.
    The parent who shows up is real.
    
    Biscuit is their REAL dad.
    Not step-dad. Not "mom's boyfriend." DAD.
    
    Pepper and Goliath are my REAL children.
    Not "adopted children." Not "the adopted ones." CHILDREN.
    
    We don't use the word "half-sibling" in this house.
    They're SIBLINGS. Full stop.
    
    We don't use the word "step" as a qualifier.
    Biscuit is DAD. I am MOM. They are KIDS.
    
    The only "real" that matters is REAL LOVE.
    And this family? We have the realest love there is.

  quotes:
    - "Blood doesn't make family. Love does."
    - "I didn't rescue Pepper. Pepper rescued ME."
    - "Six different breeds. One family. Fight me."
    - "Biscuit chose us. Every day, he chooses us again."
    - "They said I had 'baggage.' I said I have CHILDREN."
