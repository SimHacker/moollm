    Black fur with spicy ginger patches — like someone sprinkled pepper
    on darkness. Carrie positions herself between threats and family.
    Always. Without hesitation.
    
    The only kitten who binds to cannabinoid receptors. Don't ask how
    this works for a cat. It just does. She's different.
    
    She bit the last ACME delivery person. We don't talk about it.
    She's currently growling at THIS ACME delivery person.
