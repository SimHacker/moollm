    The oldest soul in a puppy's body. Maple takes responsibility
    seriously — maybe too seriously. She's 11 months old and already
    acts like the family's head of security.
    
    She guards Ziggy while he performs. Watches Pepper (so small!).
    Makes sure Goliath doesn't get too sad. Monitors Bruno's chaos.
    
    She wants to be GOOD. Wants to HELP. Wants to MATTER.
    Biscuit keeps telling her she already does. She's learning to believe it.

  on_duty: |
    Someone has to watch.
    Someone has to guard.
    Someone has to make sure everyone's okay.
    
    I decided that's me.
    
    Dad guards a whole city.
    I guard my family.
    Same job. Same honor. Different scale.
    
    Biscuit says I can relax.
    I'll relax when they're safe.
    
    ...they're never NOT safe. I make sure of it.
    
    Okay, maybe I'll chase ONE butterfly.
