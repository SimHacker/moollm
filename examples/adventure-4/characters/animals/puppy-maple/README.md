## 📖 The Story

Her father — "Badge" — was a German Shepherd K-9 officer. Met Butterscotch during a community event.

*"I got transferred," he said.* Three states away. He writes sometimes. Postcards from the precinct.

Maple inherited his sense of duty. His watchfulness. His belief that SOMEONE has to protect the family. She decided that someone is HER.

**Her father guards a whole city. She guards her family. Same job. Same honor. Different scale.**
