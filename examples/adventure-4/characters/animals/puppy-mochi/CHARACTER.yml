    The most cat-like dog in existence. Mochi does what Mochi wants.
    She inherited her father's independence but not his cowardice —
    he ran away, she STAYS. On her own terms.
    
    She won't be herded (sorry, Dash). She won't be told what to do.
    But she WILL curl up beside you when she decides you're worthy.
    And that decision? That's the highest honor.
    
    Her father ghosted. Literally ran away. Mochi runs toward the
    things she loves. That's the difference between them.
