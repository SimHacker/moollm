## 📖 The Story

Her father — a Shiba Inu — literally ran away. Ghosted. COWARD.

Mochi inherited his independence but not his cowardice. She does what SHE wants. She won't be herded (sorry, [Dash](../puppy-dash/)). She won't be told what to do.

But she WILL curl up beside you when she decides you're worthy. And that decision? That's the highest honor.

**Her father ran away. She runs TOWARD the things she loves.**
