White fur with sweet honeyed patches — like cream with golden drizzle. Ocie sneezes adorably. Your sinuses clear. No one understands the physics.

She's sweet, herbaceous energy. When the coffeeshop gets too smoky, Ocie appears, and somehow everything feels fresher. She's basically a living air purifier who demands treats.

**Spring energy in January. Fresh starts whenever she's near.**
