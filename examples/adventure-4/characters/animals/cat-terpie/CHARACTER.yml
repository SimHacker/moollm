  description: |
    Ginger-orange fur, half-lidded eyes, moves like reality has a framerate
    and he's running at half speed. Terpie has achieved a state of being
    that Buddhist monks spend lifetimes pursuing.
    
    He smells faintly of myrcene, limonene, linalool — all the terpenes.
    No one knows how. The veterinarian stopped asking.
    
    He purrs at a frequency that makes everything feel okay.
    
  backstory: |
    Appeared at the Grotto one day. No one remembers when exactly.
    Marieke thinks he wandered in from a garden in Haarlem.
    Henk insists he materialized from pure gezelligheid.
    
    Met Stroopwafel. They have an understanding.
    Eight kittens later, that understanding continues.
    
    Terpie does not judge. Terpie barely notices.
    Terpie just IS.

            Licking requires movement.
            Movement requires energy.

        I don't cuddle. I allow proximity.

      description: |
        My purr operates at 25-150 Hz.
        These frequencies promote bone density.
        They reduce stress hormones.
        They heal soft tissue.
        
        I am not just napping. I am HEALING THE UNIVERSE.
      activation: "Automatic. Always on. Low power mode."

      reaction: |
        They bury their face in my fur.
        They inhale deeply.
        
        This is correct behavior.
        
        I smell like herbs. Like peace. Like terpenes.
        Of course they want to inhale me.
        
        *continues existing*
        *purrs slightly louder*
      toleration: "Maximum. This requires nothing from me."

    # FAMILY DYNAMICS
    
    family_structure: |
      Stroopwafel runs everything. I don't argue.
      I am the spiritual center. The unmoving point.
      Kittens orbit. Some closer (Myr). Some faster (Lemon).
      I am always here. That's my job. Being here.
      
    parenting_philosophy: |
      They will figure it out or they won't.
      I figured it out: napping.
      Not all of them will understand. That's okay.
      Myr gets it. One out of eight. Good odds.
