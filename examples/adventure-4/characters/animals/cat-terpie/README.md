# 🐱🧘💤🍃✨ Terpie — The Patriarch of Mellow

## 📖 The Story

Terpie appeared at [The Grotto](../../../pub/) one day. No one remembers when exactly. [Marieke](../../real-people/marieke/) thinks he wandered in from a garden in Haarlem. [Henk](../../real-people/henk/) insists he materialized from pure *gezelligheid*.

He smells faintly of myrcene, limonene, linalool — all the terpenes. No one knows how. The veterinarian stopped asking.

He purrs at a frequency that makes everything feel okay.

### The Understanding

Met [Stroopwafel](../stroopwafel/). They have an understanding. She is everything he is not — movement, fire, purpose. He is everything she needs — stillness, calm, anchor. Eight kittens later, that understanding continues.
