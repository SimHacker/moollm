    The biggest puppy you've ever seen, with the softest heart to match.
    Teddy got his father's size and his mother's warmth. At 10 months,
    he's already 75 pounds of pure comfort.
    
    His specialty is knowing when someone needs a hug. He'll lean his
    entire body weight against you — not to knock you over, but to
    let you know: I'm here. I'm not going anywhere.
    
    His father left before he was born. He doesn't think about it.
    He has Biscuit now. Biscuit is DAD.
