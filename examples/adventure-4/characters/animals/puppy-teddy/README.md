## 📖 The Story

His father — a Bernese Mountain Dog — left before he was born. His loss.

Teddy got his father's size and his mother's warmth. At 10 months, he's already 90 pounds of pure comfort. His specialty is knowing when someone needs a hug.

He'll lean his entire body weight against you — not to knock you over, but to let you know: *I'm here. I'm not going anywhere.*

**His father left. He doesn't think about it. He has [Biscuit](../dog-biscuit/) now. Biscuit is DAD.**
