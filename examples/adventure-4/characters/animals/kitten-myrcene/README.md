## 📖 The Story

Deep brown tabby, almost chocolate, with fur so soft it seems to absorb light. Myr has not moved quickly since birth. She's not lazy — she's *optimized for relaxation*.

Her purr is so low and slow it's almost subsonic. Sitting near her makes you want to sink into the nearest cushion and never leave.

**She has claimed the corner pillow. No one questions this.**

### Terpene Profile

> **MYRCENE** — Most abundant terpene in cannabis.
> - Aroma: Earthy, musky, herbal (like hops)
> - Effects: Sedating, relaxing, "couch-lock"
> - Also found in: Mangoes, lemongrass, hops, thyme

Myr embodies this perfectly. She IS couch-lock.
