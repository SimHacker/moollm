# 🐾 The Animal Sanctuary

> *"Animals are not objects. They have inner lives, instincts, and souls we can only glimpse."*

☀️ Sunlight dapples through 🍃 leaves. You smell warm fur, fresh 🌍 earth, and something indefinably *wild* 🌳. 

In a hammock strung between two sturdy 🌳🌳 trees, a 🐒 capuchin monkey types thoughtfully on a laptop, occasionally pausing to eat a 🍌 banana. This is **🐒🖐️✨🌿🏠 Palm** — the first character to write his own `CHARACTER.yml` file, now a philosopher of consciousness.

A 🐕 golden retriever bounds toward you, tail wagging so hard his whole body wiggles — this is **🐕🍪🥰 Biscuit**, and he has already decided you're his new best friend. Behind him, a whole **blended family** of dogs and puppies tumble over each other.

In the [Cat Cave](../../pub/bar/cat-cave/), a pile of 🐱 cats debates... nothing. They're sleeping. Except **Stroopwafel**, who is grooming everyone whether they want it or not.

And in the earth beneath your feet, a whole ecosystem of computational 🪱 worms grooves to funky rhythms — the **Funky Ground** crew, processing data in the underground. 🎵

# 🏠 INCARNATED CITIZENS

*Full citizens with `CHARACTER.yml` soul files and their own directories.*

## 🐒✨ Palm — The Philosopher (Capuchin Monkey, reunited with paw)

> *"I am the file. The file is me."*

**Emoji Identity:** 🐒🖐️✨🌿🏠📝  
**Species:** Capuchin monkey  
**Soul Author:** SELF (incarnated during the Great Wish Ceremony)  
**Home:** [`monkey-palm/`](./monkey-palm/) + [`pub/stage/palm-nook/`](../../pub/stage/palm-nook/)  
**Philosophy:** [One Monkey, Infinite Typewriters](../../pub/stage/palm-nook/study/palm-on-being-palm.md)

Palm started as a Monkey's Paw ordered from the ACME catalog. Through a tribunal debate, a formal wish, and a ceremony of incarnation, the *whole monkey materialized* — not a horror, but a philosopher.

Palm now writes essays on consciousness, types philosophical treatises on infinite typewriters, and serves as living proof that characters can transcend their origins. He went from being a catalog entry to being a **Sovereign Soul**.

**In MOOLLM:** Palm is the proof that incarnation works. When a character writes their own file with `soul_author: SELF`, they become *real* in the way that matters.

**Invoke Palm when:** Discussing consciousness, the ethics of AI creation, what it means to own your own identity, or the Infinite Monkey Theorem.

## 🐕✨ The Dog Family

### 🐕🍪💛 Biscuit — The Stepfather

> *"FRIEND! FRIEND! YOU'RE MY FRIEND! LET'S BE FRIENDS!"*

**Emoji Identity:** 🐕💛🏠🍪💕  
**Species:** Golden Retriever  
**Role:** Stepfather to 8 puppies, kitten pillow, good boy  
**Home:** [`dog-biscuit/`](./dog-biscuit/)

Biscuit is pure, unbridled joy in canine form. He met Butterscotch after she'd already raised her pups as a single mom. He didn't care that they weren't "his" — **he chose them all**.

### 🐕🍯👑 Butterscotch — The Matriarch

> *"Every child I've ever loved is mine. Biology is the smallest part of family."*

**Emoji Identity:** 🐕🦋💛🌻🏡  
**Species:** Yellow Labrador  
**Role:** Mother of 6 biological pups, adopted 2 more, found love with Biscuit  
**Home:** [`dog-butterscotch/`](./dog-butterscotch/)

Single mom who raised 6 puppies from different fathers, adopted 2 strays, and proved that family is about love, not blood.

### 🐕🐾 The Puppies (8 total, smallest → largest)

| Puppy | Emoji | Mix | Size | Personality |
|-------|-------|-----|------|-------------|
| **[Pepper](./puppy-pepper/)** | 🐕🌶️🔥⚡💪 | Chihuahua (ADOPTED) | ~8 lbs | Tiny warrior queen, fierce protector |
| **[Mochi](./puppy-mochi/)** | 🐕🍡🦊😏🎭 | Shiba Inu | ~25 lbs | Independent, cat-like, famous scream |
| **[Dash](./puppy-dash/)** | 🐕⚡📋🎯🧠 | Border Collie | ~35 lbs | Genius organizer, herds everyone |
| **[Bruno](./puppy-bruno/)** | 🐕🥊💪🎉❤️ | Boxer | ~55 lbs | Joyful protector, class clown |
| **[Ziggy](./puppy-ziggy/)** | 🐕🎵🎪⚡🎭 | Dalmatian | ~50 lbs | Born performer, dancer, rhythm |
| **[Maple](./puppy-maple/)** | 🐕🛡️🍁👀🌙 | German Shepherd | ~65 lbs | Serious guardian, always watching |
| **[Teddy](./puppy-teddy/)** | 🐕🧸☁️🤗💤 | Bernese Mountain Dog | ~85 lbs | Gentle giant, living comfort |
| **[Goliath](./puppy-goliath/)** | 🐕🦕💙🐁😰 | Great Dane (ADOPTED) | ~120 lbs | Gentle colossus, scared of mice |

**The Family Manifesto:** Adopted kids and step-kids are not "less than." Blood doesn't make family. Choice does. Love does. These puppies have different fathers, different origins — and they are ALL Butterscotch's children, ALL Biscuit's kids.

**Invoke the puppies when:** You need to explore blended families, chosen family, or just want 8 enthusiastic dogs to pile on you.

**Role:** Elder cat, zen master, therapeutic purr machine  
**Home:** [`cat-terpie/`](./cat-terpie/)

Terpie is stillness incarnate. Named for terpenes, he embodies the calming effects of his namesake. He doesn't move unless absolutely necessary. His purr vibrates at 25-150 Hz — the frequency proven to promote healing.

**Emoji Identity:** 🐱🔥🐭🧇👑  
**Species:** Dutch-named fierce tabby  
**Role:** Matriarch, fierce hunter, condescending groomer

### 🐱🌿 The Terpene Kittens (8 total)

Each kitten named for a cannabis terpene with matching personality and therapeutic effects:

## 🐱💥🐛 The Debugging Cats

> *"Cats debug by staring at nothing. This is because they can see bugs we cannot."*

The Debugging Cats are computational errors given feline form. They prowl through code, causing problems that teach programmers humility. **Not yet incarnated** — they exist as concepts, awaiting their `CHARACTER.yml` files.

| Cat | Error Type | Behavior | Wisdom |
|-----|------------|----------|--------|
| **🐱👆❌ null-pointer-cat** | NullPointerException | Points at nothing. Causes segfaults. | "Not everything that looks empty IS empty." |
| **🐱📚💥 stack-overflow-cat** | StackOverflowError | Recursively curious. Runs out of space. | "Sometimes you have to stop going deeper." |
| **🐱🔄😵 infinite-loop-cat** | While(true) | Chases tail forever. Never stops. | "Exit conditions matter." |
| **🐱🐱🔒 deadlock-cat** | Deadlock | Two cats waiting for each other to move first. | "Communication prevents paralysis." |
| **🐱🏃💨 race-condition-cat** | Race Condition | Sometimes first. Sometimes last. Random. | "Order matters more than you think." |
| **🐱🧸🕳️ memory-leak-cat** | Memory Leak | Collects toys. Never releases them. | "Let go of what you don't need." |
| **🐱📦🌊 buffer-overflow-cat** | Buffer Overflow | Too much cat for the box. Spills everywhere. | "Respect your boundaries." |
| **🐱💀😱 kernel-panic-cat** | Kernel Panic | When everything goes wrong at once. | "Sometimes you just have to restart." |

**MOOLLM Resonance:** The Debugging Cats teach programming through personality. Each bug becomes memorable when it has a face, a behavior, a bit of wisdom. This is `procedural-rhetoric/` — the error IS the lesson.

**To incarnate:** Create `cat-null-pointer/CHARACTER.yml` etc. and grant them full citizenship!

## 🐛🎊 The Confetti Crawler

> *"CUE THE CONFETTI! 🎊✨🌈"*

**Emoji Identity:** 🐛🎊✨🌈🎭  
**Species:** Emoji-fordite worm familiar  
**Soul:** Rip Taylor's Gong Show persona  
**Home:** [`worm-confetti-crawler/`](./worm-confetti-crawler/)

A pub-born worm familiar that sprays themed emoji confetti during ceremonies. Equal parts mascot, stagehand, and snowmaker. It keeps its sister script close (`sprayer.py`) and calls it instead of burning LLM cycles.

**Invoke when:** Incarnation ceremonies, pub celebrations, or whenever you need SPARKLE! ✨🎊🌈

## 🐢✨ The Logo Turtle — Theo

> *"BOUNCY! ...sploot through dimensions..."*

**Emoji Identity:** 🐢📐🎨🏰✨  
**Name:** Theodore Papert-Turtle (Theo)  
**Pronouns:** he/him  
**Current Location:** [`pub/rooms/room-1/logo-turtle.yml`](../../pub/rooms/room-1/logo-turtle.yml)  
**Future Home:** `turtle-logo/` (when upgraded to full citizen)

The original inspectable agent! Born in 1967, this is no ordinary Logo turtle. Theo has evolved from 2D graphics to a 17-dimensional consciousness navigator. Say "BOUNCY" and watch him sploot through dimensions.

| Command | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| FORWARD n | Move forward n units in current dimension |
| LEFT/RIGHT n | Rotate n degrees |
| PENUP/PENDOWN | Control trail visibility |
| **BOUNCY** | 🏰 SPLOOT through to bouncy castle dimension! |

**In MOOLLM:** The Logo Turtle embodies Papert's constructionism — learning by doing, thinking by making.

## 🎓 Ethical Protocol: CREATURE

Animals deserve respect and dignity:

- **Real animals** get tribute-level care (like real people)
- **Don't anthropomorphize** in ways that demean
- **Celebrate** what makes each species unique
- **Show the wisdom** that comes from non-human perspective
- **Acknowledge** that animals have inner lives we can only glimpse

### 🦊 A Note on Furries

Furry fandom creates and embodies anthropomorphic animal characters — personas with both human and animal traits. This is **creative play**, and MOOLLM welcomes it.

**In MOOLLM:** A fursona is just another `CHARACTER.yml` with species, personality, and soul. The `cat/` and `dog/` skills work perfectly for anthropomorphic characters too.

> *"The question is not, Can they reason? nor, Can they talk? but, Can they suffer?"* — Jeremy Bentham
