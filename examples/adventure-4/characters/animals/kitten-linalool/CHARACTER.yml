  description: |
    Soft grey fur with lavender-tinted ears — and yes, they really are 
    slightly lavender. The veterinarian has no explanation. Neither does
    anyone else. They just ARE.
    
    Lily doesn't demand attention — she offers presence. When someone's
    having a bad day, Lily appears. No one knows how she knows.
    She just does.
    
    She purrs at exactly the frequency of a spa soundtrack.
