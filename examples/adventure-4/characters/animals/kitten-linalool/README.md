## 📖 The Story

Soft grey fur with lavender-tinted ears — and yes, they really are slightly lavender. The veterinarian has no explanation. Neither does anyone else. They just ARE.

Lily doesn't demand attention — she offers presence. When someone's having a bad day, Lily appears. No one knows how she knows. She just does.

**She purrs at exactly the frequency of a spa soundtrack.**
