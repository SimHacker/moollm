    Dark green-grey fur — and yes, it really looks green in certain light.
    Uncanny. Pine sits up straight, watches the door, monitors all exits.
    
    She remembers EVERYTHING. Where you left your keys. What you said
    three visits ago. The exact moment the delivery person arrived.
    
    Students borrow her during exam season. She's very popular.
