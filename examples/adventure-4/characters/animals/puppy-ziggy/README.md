## 📖 The Story

His father — "Staccato" — was a show dog who traveled with a performance troupe. Met Butterscotch at a county fair.

*"I have gigs," he said. "I can't stay."*

He didn't stay. But Ziggy inherited his spots AND his rhythm. Every movement is choreographed. Every bark is on beat. He can't help it. The music is IN him.

**His father performs for crowds. Ziggy performs for FAMILY. Better audience.**
