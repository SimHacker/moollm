  origin_story: |
    Father: A Dalmatian named "Staccato" — a show dog who traveled with 
    a performance troupe. Met Butterscotch at a county fair.
    
    "I have gigs," he said. "I can't stay."
    He didn't stay.
    
    But Ziggy inherited his spots AND his rhythm.
    Every movement is choreographed. Every bark is on beat.
    He can't help it. The music is IN him.
