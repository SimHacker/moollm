## 📖 The Story

He met [Butterscotch](../dog-butterscotch/) — a single mom with six puppies from six different fathers, plus [Pepper](../puppy-pepper/) who she'd already adopted.

Some dogs would have run. Some dogs would have seen "baggage."

Biscuit saw a family. And he wanted IN.

Then they adopted [Goliath](../puppy-goliath/) together — their first child as partners. A giant dog who'd been waiting in a shelter for two years.

**He didn't ask whose puppies they were. He asked how he could help.**
