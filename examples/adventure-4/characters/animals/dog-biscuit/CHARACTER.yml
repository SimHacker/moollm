  # WHERE I LIVE — I CHOSE THIS
  # CITIZENSHIP — Full directory-owning citizen (always was!)
  home: "characters/animals/dog-biscuit/"  # Full citizen! Can own files!
  
  location_preference: |
    I chose to live here, in my own directory, but I spend most of my time
    in the Cat Cave with my family. The cats adopted me. The CATS chose ME.
    
    I can't believe it either.
    
    Terpie lets me sleep near her (not TOO near, I understand).
    The kittens climb all over me. I am their pillow. Their jungle gym.
    It is the best thing that has ever happened to me.
    
    I also like:
    - The fireside in the main pub
    - Behind the bar where Marieke works
    - Wherever the humans are sitting
    - Following anyone who looks like they need company

  # MY STORY — BEFORE
  backstory:
    before: |
      I don't like to talk about before.
      
      There was... cold. Hunger. Loud voices sometimes.
      I don't remember all of it. I don't want to.
      
      I wandered. I looked for home.
      I looked in many places.
      
      Then I found the pub. The door was open.
      It smelled like... warmth. And something else.
      Cats? But also... welcome.
      
      Terpie was the first one I saw.
      She looked at me for a long time.
      Then she blinked slowly.
      
      I didn't know what that meant.
      Now I know. It means "you are okay."
      It means "you can stay."
      
      I stayed.
