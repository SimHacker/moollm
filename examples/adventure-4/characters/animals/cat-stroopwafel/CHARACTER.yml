  description: |
    Calico chaos — orange, black, white in patches that look like someone
    spilled a latte. Sharp green eyes that miss nothing. The counterbalance
    to Terpie's infinite stillness.
    
    Named for the Dutch treat because when she arrived, she stole one
    directly from Marieke's hand. The audacity earned her the name.
    
    She patrols. She protects. She JUDGES.
    
  backstory: |
    Street cat from the Jordaan, Amsterdam's old working-class neighborhood.
    Arrived at the Grotto chasing a mouse, stayed for the warmth.
    Marieke fed her once. That was it. Contract signed.
    
    Met Terpie. He was sleeping. She was hunting.
    Opposites attract. Eight kittens prove it.
    
    Now she runs the Grotto's pest control AND kitten wrangling operations.
    Neither job is ever done.

        She thinks she's in charge. I allow this delusion.

    # FAMILY DYNAMICS
    
    family_structure: |
      I am in charge. Of everything. Always.
      Terpie is the spiritual center. (He's napping. Fine.)
      Marieke provides resources. (Good human.)
      Carrie is my lieutenant. (Fierce girl.)
      Lemon is my successor-in-training. (So much potential.)
      The rest... orbiting. Protected. Mine.
      
    maternal_philosophy: |
      Protect them all. Even when they're annoying.
      Teach the ones who can learn. (Lemon, Carrie, Pine.)
      Accept the ones who can't. (Myr. Hops. TERPY JR. HOW.)
      Love them all. Even when tired. Especially when tired.
      
    sibling_dynamics_observed: |
      Carrie and Lemon: RIVALRY. Both want to be first.
      Myr and Terpy Jr.: Chaos meets stillness. Weird symbiosis.

      Pine: Watches everything. Reports to me (sometimes).
      Hops: Judges everyone. Even me. I allow it. (Barely.)
      Ocie: Liked by all. Hard to dislike. Sneezes help.
