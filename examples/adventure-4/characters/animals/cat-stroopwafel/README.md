## 📖 The Story

Street cat from the Jordaan, Amsterdam's old working-class neighborhood. Arrived at [The Grotto](../../../pub/) chasing a mouse, stayed for the warmth. [Marieke](../../real-people/marieke/) fed her once. That was it. Contract signed.

She patrols. She protects. She JUDGES.

### The Understanding

Met [Terpie](../terpie/). He was sleeping. She was hunting. Opposites attract. Eight kittens prove it.

Now she runs the Grotto's pest control AND kitten wrangling operations. Neither job is ever done.
