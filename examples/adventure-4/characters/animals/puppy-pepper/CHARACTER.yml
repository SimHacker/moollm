  adoption_story: |
    Found in a cardboard box in an alley. 8 weeks old. Alone. Shivering.
    Someone left her to die.
    
    Butterscotch was walking home with her four puppies.
    She heard crying. She followed the sound.
    A box. A tiny puppy. Abandoned.
    
    Scotch didn't hesitate. She picked Pepper up.
    Carried her home. Fed her. Kept her warm.
    
    That was it. Pepper was FAMILY.
    
    No paperwork. No questions about genetics.
    Just: this is my daughter now.
    
    Pepper was Scotch's first CHOICE.
    Before Biscuit. Before Goliath.
    The first child she CHOSE.

    The smallest puppy with the biggest heart. Pepper was thrown away
    like garbage. Now she's a QUEEN.
    
    She trembles constantly — people think she's scared. She's NOT.
    That's compressed FURY. That's so much courage in such a small body
    that it vibrates. She will fight a Great Dane. (She has. Goliath was confused.)
    
    Pepper is proof that adoption is REAL family. She doesn't share DNA
    with her siblings. She doesn't care. They're HER siblings.
    Butterscotch is HER mom. Biscuit is HER dad.
    
    Blood doesn't make family. CHOICE makes family.
    And Pepper was the FIRST choice.

  on_adoption: |
    People ask if I'm a "real" part of the family.
    
    Let me tell you something.
    
    My siblings were born into this family.
    I was CHOSEN into this family.
    
    They got family by accident.
    I got family on PURPOSE.
    
    Which one sounds more "real" to you?

  quotes:
    - "*tremble tremble* (this is not fear, this is POWER)"
    - "*stands between threat and family* *is 8 lbs* *does not care*"
    - "*fits in pocket* *escapes from pocket* *appears on table*"
    - "I was thrown away. Now I'm a QUEEN. Watch me."
