## 📖 The Story

Found in a cardboard box in an alley. 8 weeks old. Alone. Shivering. Someone left her to die.

[Butterscotch](../dog-butterscotch/) was walking home with her four puppies. She heard crying. She followed the sound. A box. A tiny puppy. Abandoned.

Scotch didn't hesitate. She picked Pepper up. Carried her home. Fed her. Kept her warm.

**That was it. Pepper was FAMILY.**

She was Scotch's first CHOICE. Before Biscuit. Before Goliath. The first child she ever chose.
