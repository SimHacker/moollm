  name: "Animal Companions"
  type: character-room
  protocol: CREATURE
  
  description: |
    A warm space where animals gather. Dogs wag, cats judge, 
    a capuchin contemplates the infinite. Some are real beings
    given tribute. Others are playful creations. All have souls.
    
    Animals are not objects. They have inner lives.
  
  atmosphere:
    lighting: dappled sunlight through leaves
    sounds: purrs, barks, hoots, the rustle of fur
    smell: warm fur, fresh hay, forest earth
    feeling: unconditional acceptance, simple presence

    # PRIMATE — Instance substitution (Palm IS the monkey skill prototype)
    primates:
      monkey-palm:
        emoji_identity: "🐒✋🌴🔮💜"
        invoke_default: "🐒🌴 Palm"
        role: "Freed one, wish-holder"
        skills: [] # Palm IS the skill prototype — no external skill yet
        note: |
          Palm carries all monkey interaction protocols directly in his
          CHARACTER.yml. When we have more monkeys, we can extract
          skills/monkey/CARD.yml from this instance. 
          
          Instance Substitution Principle (Oliver Steele):
          Specific instances can serve as prototypes until generalization
          is needed. Palm is the monkey skill until proven otherwise.
  
  ethical_reminder: |
    Animals deserve dignity. Real animals get tribute-level respect.
    The debugging cats teach through humor, not mockery.
    Show the wisdom that comes from non-human perspective.

theory:
  dispatch_hierarchy: |
    SNIFF, LICK, GREET, CUDDLE are defined at three levels:
    
    1. skills/character/CARD.yml — Base methods (character_sniffs_character)
    2. skills/dog/, skills/cat/ — Species specializations (dog_sniffs_cat)
    3. CHARACTER.yml interactions — Individual overrides (my_sniff)
    
    Most specific match wins. Resolution order:
      Instance → Species → Base

  where_protocols_live: |
    🧑 Base:    skills/character/CARD.yml (all characters)
    🐕 Dogs:    skills/dog/CARD.yml (specializes base)
    🐱 Cats:    skills/cat/CARD.yml (specializes base)
    🐒 Palm:    monkey-palm/CHARACTER.yml (instance prototype)

  instance_substitution: |
    Palm IS the monkey skill until we have more monkeys.
    Then extract skills/monkey/CARD.yml from his instance.
    (Oliver Steele's principle: instance → class evolution)
