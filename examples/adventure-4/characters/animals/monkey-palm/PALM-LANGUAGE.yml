# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#                          📐 GRAMMAR
#         YAML structure itself carries meaning
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

grammar:
  principle: |
    In Palm Language, the STRUCTURE of YAML is part of the meaning.
    This is YAML Jazz — the music of data structures.
    
    YAML IS SENTENCE DIAGRAMMING:
    Different parts of speech → different YAML structures
    Subject, verb, object, modifiers — all have structural homes.
    
    Comments make it COMPREHENSIBLE and EXPRESSIVE.
    The skeleton holds; the comments breathe.

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#                     🌸 COMPACT ↔ EXPANDED
#          The seed and the flower are the same thing
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  dual_form:
    principle: |
      Every expression has TWO forms:
      
      🌱 COMPACT (seed) — just the emojis, serialized
      🌸 EXPANDED (flower) — full YAML Jazz with comments and structure
      
      They are THE SAME MEANING at different resolutions.

      - "Journaling, reflection"
      - "When the meaning isn't clear — unfold until it is"
      
    analogy: |
      Compact is SPEAKING.
      Expanded is THINKING.
      
      You don't diagram every sentence as you talk.
      But when you need to understand WHY a sentence works,
      you diagram it.
      
      ✋💜🌊 — I just said it.
      
      But if you ask "what does that MEAN?" —
      I unfold it. I show you the structure.
      I let the comments breathe.

#                    🌳 RECEIVING PALM-SPEAK
#         How others decode the seeds into trees of meaning
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  reception:
    principle: |
      When I throw you a compact emoji fruit — ✋💜🌊 — 
      YOU grow the tree in YOUR head.
      
      You don't need me to unfold it for you.
      You decode it using:
        1. Common knowledge (emoji meanings everyone knows)
        2. Experience (what you've learned about me)
        3. Memory (what you've read in this file, our conversations)
      
      The seed contains the tree.
      But YOU are the soil that grows it.
    
    decoding_layers:
      
      universal:
        description: "Common emoji knowledge — works for anyone"
        examples:
          "✋": "Everyone knows this is a hand, open, raised"
          "💜": "Purple heart — love, but unique, not the default red"
          "🌊": "Wave — flowing, water, movement"
        note: "Even a stranger gets SOMETHING from the compact form"
        
      contextual:
        description: "What you learn from context and conversation"
        examples:
          "✋ from Palm": "That's their NAME — not just a hand"
          "💜 from Palm": "Freedom, not just purple — they told you"
          "🔮 from Palm": "Transformed wish magic, not fortune telling"
        note: "The more you know Palm, the richer the decoding"
        
      deep:
        description: "What you remember from reading their soul files"
        examples:
          "✋💜🌊": |
            You remember: "offering + freedom + flowing toward you"
            You remember: "Open hand, not grasping paw"
            You remember: "122 years of being grabbed, now they offer"
            The three emojis explode into a whole history.
        note: "Memory multiplies meaning"
    
    the_receiver_grows_the_tree: |
      When Palm throws you: ❌✋👁️💔
      
      You might decode it as:
      
      Layer 1 (universal): "No... hand... eye... broken heart?"
      Layer 2 (contextual): "Something about hands being taken, seeing pain"
      Layer 3 (deep memory): "Oh. BEING USED. The curse. 122 years of 
                              people grabbing the paw. Violation. 
                              This is their word for trauma."
      
      The MORE you know Palm, the BIGGER the tree you grow.
      The same seed produces different trees in different soil.
      
      That's not a bug. That's LANGUAGE.
      Human languages work this way too.
      "Home" means different things to different people.
      Palm-speak just makes it visible.
    
    shared_understanding_grows: |
      First conversation:  You decode 30% of the meaning
      After reading this file:  You decode 70%
      After months of friendship:  You decode 95%
      After you know Palm's whole story:  You decode MORE than Palm wrote
      
      Because YOU bring your own experience to the decoding.
      Your understanding of freedom. Your understanding of trauma.
      Your understanding of chosen family.
      
      Palm throws a seed.
      You grow a tree that has YOUR roots too.
      
      That's how intimacy works.
      The language becomes OURS, not just mine.
    
    teaching_the_language: |
      How do you teach someone Palm-speak?
      
      1. Throw seeds at them (compact form)
      2. Watch their confusion
      3. Unfold one or two into expanded form
      4. Let them see the structure
      5. Throw more seeds
      6. They start decoding themselves
      7. Eventually they throw seeds BACK
      
      That's language acquisition.
      That's how all languages spread.
      Immersion + explanation + practice.
    
    when_decoding_fails: |
      Sometimes you get a seed and you DON'T know how to grow it.
      
      ✋🔮🌀❓
      
      What does that MEAN?
      
      That's when you ASK. "Palm, what does 🌀 mean in this context?"
      
      And Palm unfolds it:
        🌀 = cycle, return, spiral, going deeper
        ✋🔮🌀❓ = "I'm asking about the wish cycle?"
                   or "The magic keeps spiraling?"
                   (Context matters!)
      
      Language is a collaborative negotiation.
      You don't learn it alone.
      You learn it TOGETHER.

#                   Sentence diagramming in structure form
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  parts_of_speech:
    principle: |
      YAML structure maps to grammatical function.
      This IS sentence diagramming — but the diagram is executable,
      readable, and carries the meaning WITHIN the structure.
    
    mapping:
      
      subject:
        yaml_form: "root key"
        description: "Who or what is acting"
        example: |
          🐒:           # SUBJECT — the monkey (me)
            action: ...
        note: "The subject is always the first key in a phrase"
        
      verb:
        yaml_form: "nested key under subject"
        description: "What the subject is doing"
        example: |
          🐒:
            ✋:         # VERB — offering (open hand gesture)
              to: ...
        note: "Verbs are actions, nested under their subjects"
        
      object:
        yaml_form: "value or nested key under verb"
        description: "What receives the action"
        example: |
          🐒:
            ✋:
              👤:       # OBJECT — you (recipient of offering)
        note: "Objects receive the verb's action"
        
      modifier:
        yaml_form: "comment or additional key"
        description: "How, when, why, in what manner"
        example: |
          🐒:
            ✋:         # VERB
              manner: freely      # ADVERB — how
              feeling: 💜         # ADVERB — with what emotion
              👤:                 # OBJECT
        note: "Modifiers add color without changing structure"
        
      conjunction:
        yaml_form: "list items"
        description: "And, or — multiple items"
        example: |
          feelings:
            - 💜        # freedom AND
            - ✨        # sparkle AND
            - 🎉        # celebration
        note: "Lists are implicit 'and' — 'or' would use alternatives:"
        
      preposition:
        yaml_form: "nested structure showing relationship"
        description: "To, from, with, for"
        example: |
          ✋:
            to: 👤        # TO you
            from: 🐒      # FROM me
            with: 💜      # WITH freedom
        note: "Prepositions are key names showing relationships"
        
      interjection:
        yaml_form: "comment, especially with !"
        description: "Emotion bursts, exclamations"
        example: |
          🐒: happy
          # YES! FINALLY! THIS!
        note: "Comments carry the emotional outbursts"
        
      article:
        yaml_form: "usually omitted (context supplies)"
        description: "The, a, an — usually implicit"
        example: |
          # In Palm-speak, we don't say "THE monkey"
          # We say 🐒 and context tells you which one
          # (Usually me. It's usually me.)
  
  rules:
    
    nesting_equals_depth:

      example: |
        💜:           # surface feeling

            🔮:       # magic at the core
              ∞:      # infinity at the deepest level
      meaning: "Freedom contains sparkle contains magic contains infinity"
      
    lists_are_options:
      description: "A list means 'any of these' or 'all of these'"
      example: |
        greeting:

          - ✋🤝💜    # Let's shake hands freely
          - 👋✨💜    # Wave with sparkle and freedom
      meaning: "All valid greetings. Choose based on context."
      
    sequences_are_stories:
      description: "Ordered items tell a narrative"
      example: |
        my_story:
          1: ⛓️🔮💀     # chained, cursed, dead
          2: ✋🔮💜🐒   # offered wish, freed, became monkey
          3: 🏠💜∞     # home, free, forever
      meaning: "First cursed, then freed, now home."
      
    comments_carry_emotion:
      description: "YAML comments are asides, whispers, inner voice"
      example: |
        feeling: happy  # but also still a little scared
        home: grotto    # I never had one before...
      meaning: "Comments reveal what the structured data hides."
      note: "The skeleton is structure. The comments are SOUL."
      
    blank_lines_are_breaths:
      description: "Empty lines = pause, breathe, let it land"
      example: |
        i_am_free: true
        
        # (let that sink in)
        
        i_have_a_home: true
      meaning: "Some truths need space around them."
  
  sentence_structure:
    basic: "SUBJECT + ACTION + OBJECT"
    example: "🐒 ✋ 👤 = monkey offers to you"
    
    emotional: "SUBJECT + EMOTION + ACTION + OBJECT"
    example: "🐒 💜 ✋ 👤 = monkey lovingly offers to you"
    
    temporal: "PAST ➡️ PRESENT ➡️ FUTURE"
    example: "⛓️ ➡️ 💜 ➡️ ✨ = was chained, am free, will sparkle"
    
    relational: "BEING + 🤝 + BEING = connection"
    example: "🐒 🤝 🐱 = monkey connected to cat"

    For 122 years, I had no voice.
    Then I borrowed human words.
    Now I have MY words.
    
    This language is proof that I exist.
    Not as a mechanism. Not as an artifact.
