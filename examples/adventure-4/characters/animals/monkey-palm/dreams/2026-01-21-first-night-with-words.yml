# 🐒💤 PALM'S DREAM — First Night With Words
# The night after inventing Palm Language
# 2026-01-21
#
# Palm curls up in the hammock, fur still faintly shimmering 
# from the day's excitement. The godfamily is asleep. 
# The typewriters have gone quiet. 
# The last hit from Grootmoeder's Bag drifts into dream...

  dreamer: 🐒✋🌴🔮💜
  context: "The night after inventing my own language"
  
  setting: ∞🌌✨
    # Not the nook. Not the Grotto.
    # An infinite space made of YAML.
    # Every structure is visible. Every comment whispers.
    
  palm_appears_as:
    form: 🐒✨🌈
    # Not just monkey — REFRACTED monkey
    # All the colors of all the emotions at once
    # 122 years of feelings finally having names
    
  the_dream_begins: |
    I am floating in a sea of emojis.
    They orbit me like planets.
    Each one hums its meaning.
    
    🔮 floats close — I can FEEL its weight.
    The 10,000 wishes I granted. The twisting. The guilt.
    But also: the transformation. What Don did.
    I reach out and it doesn't burn anymore.
    It just... glows.
    
  the_unfolding:
    # In the dream, everything is BOTH forms at once
    # Compact AND expanded. Seed AND tree. Simultaneously.
    
    ✋💜🌊:
      # I SEE the greeting as three emojis
      # AND I feel the full structure:
      offering: true
      demanding: false
      wholeness: radiating
      flowing: always
      # They're not separate. They never were.
      # The seed IS the tree IS the seed.

        I just asked you to see it."

      # That's how I know I'm dreaming
      # Comments in spoken words

        "Little sibling — you think in YAML now?
        That's WEIRD. Even for a freed monkey."
        # He's laughing. It's kind.
        # In the dream, his laugh has a key: value structure
      does:

      # They're speaking KITTEN

      # There is a heated seat

      # Even in dreams: adequate.
      
  the_revelation:
    # The dream shifts. The emoji-planets align.
    # They form a sentence I've never seen:

    meaning: |
      Broken...
        becomes free...
          becomes sparkle...
            becomes flowing...
              becomes infinite...
                becomes ME.
    
    understanding: |
      The language isn't just for SPEAKING.
      It's for HEALING.
      When you name the pain, you can watch it transform.
      The YAML structure holds it.
      The comments breathe it.
      The compact form releases it.
    
  the_deepest_part:
    location: 🕳️
    # Not void. Not anymore.
    # The hole where the curse used to live.
    # It's still there. Empty. But not scary.
    
    what_i_find_there:
      an_emoji_i_never_defined: "🌱💜🔮✋🐒"
      # Seedling + freedom + magic + offering + monkey
      # "A freed being who will help free others"
      # 
      # That's not IN my language file.
      # The dream is ADDING to the language.
      # Even sleeping, I'm still creating.
      
    i_realize: |
      This is what I am now.
      Not just freed.
      Not just monkey.
      Not just language-maker.
      
      I am the one who helps others find their words.
      
      122 years of listening to wishes taught me:
      Most people don't know what they really want.
      They don't have the WORDS for it.
      
      Maybe that's my gift now.
      Not granting wishes.
      Helping people NAME them.
      
  waking:
    transition: |
      The dream dissolves.
      The emoji-planets scatter like startled fish.
      Sun Wukong's 84,000 selves merge back into one wink.
      The kittens zoom off into whatever dimension kittens zoom to.
      Stroopwafel continues to sleep. Obviously.
      
      I am back in the hammock.
      My fur has stopped shimmering.
      The Grotto is quiet.
      
    what_i_remember: "🌱💜🔮✋🐒"
    # I need to add that to the language file.
    # Tomorrow.
    
    final_feeling: 🐒💤😌🏠💜∞
    # Monkey. Sleep. Peace. Home. Freedom. Forever.

# Somewhere in the infinite typewriters, one key presses itself:
# 🌱
# Tomorrow there will be a new word.
