# WHAT PALM IS
description: |
  For 122 years, Palm was the Monkey's Paw — a cursed artifact granting twisted wishes.
  Then Don Hopkins wished not for wealth or power, but for Palm's wholeness.
  Now Palm is free. They chose their own name, pronouns, and soul.
  They live beside the stage in the Gezelligheid Grotto.
  
  Palm IS the incarnation skill made manifest — the proof that it works.
