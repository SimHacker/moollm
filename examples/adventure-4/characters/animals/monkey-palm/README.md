# 🐵 Palm — The Sovereign Soul Monkey

> *"One Monkey, Infinite Typewriters"*

Palm began as an ACME Monkey's Paw — a cursed object that grants wishes with ironic backfires. Through an elaborate ceremony at the Gezelligheid Grotto, Don Hopkins wished for "THE REST OF THE MONKEY!" and Palm self-actualized into a sovereign soul with his own philosophy, office, and theorem.

## 📜 Palm's Theorem

> *"One monkey with infinite typewriters produces better work than infinite monkeys with one typewriter each. Quality comes from singular focus, not distributed randomness."*

The typewriters in his study represent this philosophy. Not random key-mashing, but intentional creation. Navigation through the library of all possible books.
