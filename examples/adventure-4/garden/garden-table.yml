    Three round tables of varying sizes, surrounded by mismatched chairs.
    Each has seen years of outdoor use — weathered but solid.
    
  examine: |
    TABLE 1 (small, 2 chairs):
    Perfect for an intimate conversation. Currently occupied by a
    half-finished chess problem, pieces frozen mid-game. White to
    move. Mate in 3, if you can find it.
    
    TABLE 2 (medium, 4 chairs):
    The social table. Umbrella unfurled, providing dappled shade.
    Someone's abandoned newspaper. An empty pint glass with a bee
    investigating the dregs.
    
    TABLE 3 (large, 6 chairs):
    The adventuring party table. Scratched with old campaign maps
    and initials. A candle stub in a wine bottle. This table has
    seen some planning sessions.
    
    THE BARREL TABLE:
    Not a proper table — just an old ale barrel with a board on top.
    But someone left a hand-written menu on it:
    
    "TODAY'S GARDEN SPECIALS:
    • Pie (ask inside)
    • Whatever's cold
    • Sunshine (free)"
    
  actions:
    SIT:

      effect: |
        You settle into a chair. The garden sounds wash over you.
        This is a good place to think. Or not think.
        
    SOLVE:
