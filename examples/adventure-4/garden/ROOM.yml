    The world fades... and returns.
    
    You find yourself sitting at a garden table, a half-finished drink
    before you, as if you'd just dozed off for a moment. The afternoon
    sun is warm. Bees drone lazily among the flowers.
    
    Was it all a dream? Your inventory suggests otherwise.

    You are in the back garden of The Rusty Lantern, a cozy outdoor space
    behind the pub. Worn flagstones form a small patio, surrounded by
    planters overflowing with herbs, flowers, and things that probably
    shouldn't grow together but somehow do.
    
    TABLES AND CHAIRS are scattered about — mismatched wooden furniture
    with the comfortable patina of years of use. Someone left a newspaper.
    Someone else left a chess problem half-solved.
    
    Hanging baskets drip with flowers. A TRELLIS on the west wall supports
    climbing roses and something that might be hops. An old BARREL serves
    as a planter for sunflowers. A CAT is definitely watching you from
    somewhere, but you can't quite spot it.
    
    The BACK DOOR to the pub is immediately SOUTH — propped open, warm
    light and conversation spilling out along with the smell of ale and
    cooking.
    
    A low GATE in the garden wall leads NORTH to a narrow alley.
    
    To the EAST, a path winds toward what sounds like a main street.
    
    To the WEST, another path disappears into an overgrown side yard.
    
    It's the kind of garden where adventures begin — or where heroes
    rest between them.
    
  examine: |
    The garden is larger than it first appears. That's pub gardens for you.
    
    FLORA:
    • Lavender (buzzing with bees)
    • Rosemary (smell of memory)
    • Something tall and yellow (sunflowers, definitely sunflowers)
    • Climbing roses (red, fragrant, a few thorns)
    • Hops vines (the pub grows its own)
    • A small herb spiral (for the kitchen)
    • One SUSPICIOUS PLANT that seems to be watching back
    
    FURNITURE:
    • Three round tables (two seats, four seats, six seats)
    • A wooden bench against the wall
    • A barrel being used as a table
    • Mismatched chairs (each with a story)
    
    FEATURES:
    • Strings of unlit fairy lights (for evening)
    • A blackboard with today's specials
    • A small fountain (currently a birdbath)
    • Several flower pots of varying ambition
    
    The afternoon light is golden. Perfect adventuring weather.

        A low wooden gate in the garden wall leads into darkness.
        Beyond, shadows pool like spilled ink. You can hear something
        breathing in the darkness.
        
        Graffiti on the gate: "ABANDON HOPE" crossed out, replaced with
        "A HERO PASSED THROUGH HERE"

        The back door to The Rusty Lantern stands open, welcoming.
        Warm light, the clink of glasses, the murmur of stories being
        told and retold. The heart of the establishment.
        
        A sign on the door: "WELCOME BACK IN — WIPE YOUR FEET"

        Not a physical exit. More of a... meditation.
        
        If you close your eyes and think about who you ARE — not who you're
        pretending to be, but the actual body reading these words — you can
        phase through to the Hall of Bodies.
        
        The alcoves there hold all who have ever been or could be.
        Including you. Especially you.

      description: |
        A flagstone path winds between overgrown hedges toward what
        sounds like a busier street. You can hear cart wheels, chatter,
        and what might be a street vendor selling something dubious.
        
        The path leads to the Costume Emporium's side entrance.

      destination: ../kitchen/
      description: |
        A narrow path squeezes between the pub wall and a fence,
        disappearing into an overgrown side yard. Oddly, it smells
        like Mother's cooking — that is, if Mother ran a family
        restaurant adjacent to adventure dungeons.

  # Atmosphere
  ambience: |
    Bees drone among the lavender. A fountain burbles (or is that
    just a leaky tap?). Distant pub sounds provide a warm backdrop.
    Somewhere, a bird sings. Somewhere else, a cat doesn't care.
    
    The garden exists in a state of comfortable neglect — tended just
    enough to be charming, ignored just enough to be wild.
    
  # Weather can change!
  weather:
    current: sunny
    possibilities:
      - sunny: "Golden afternoon light, perfect for sitting outside"
      - cloudy: "Overcast but warm, good thinking weather"
      - drizzle: "Light rain, but the umbrella at table 3 works"
      - evening: "Fairy lights on, candles lit, magical"
      - night: "Moonlit, quiet, cats everywhere"
