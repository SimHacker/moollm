  description: |
    A weathered brass pneumatic tube terminal stands near the garden
    wall, partially covered in climbing roses. Despite its age, the
    mechanism hums with quiet efficiency.
    
    A speaker crackles with distant barista commentary. Bees investigate
    the tube opening, hoping for sugar.
    
    A placard reads:

    The garden terminal is simpler than the pub's — more weathered,
    wrapped in roses, but equally efficient:
