  name: Pneumatic Tube Terminal (Garden)
  type: delivery_system
  location: garden
  
  description: |
    A weathered brass pneumatic tube terminal stands near the garden
    wall, partially covered in climbing roses. Despite its age, the
    mechanism hums with quiet efficiency.
    
    A small sign reads:
    
      ┌────────────────────────────────┐
      │  GARDEN DELIVERY STATION       │
      │  Coffee ☕ Tea 🍵 Packages 📦  │
      │                                │
      │  "Fresh air + fresh coffee"    │
      └────────────────────────────────┘
    
    A capsule could arrive at any moment with a steaming beverage,
    a letter, or something unexpected.
    
  examine: |
    The garden terminal is simpler than the pub's version — more
    functional, less ornate. Brass patina'd green with age. The roses
    seem to have adopted it as a trellis.
    
    INCOMING CHUTE: Padded for hot beverages
    OUTGOING SLOT: Send items to pub or Bootstrap Room
    ORDER BELL: Ring for service
    SPEAKER: "Hello? Is anyone there? I made a latte..."
    
    A small plate notes:
    
      STATION: GARDEN
      STATUS: ONLINE
      CONNECTED TO: PUB, BOOTSTRAP ROOM
      WEATHER SHIELD: ACTIVE (keeps drinks dry!)
      
    The tube disappears into the pub wall, connecting to the main
    network. You can hear distant whooshing — the lifeblood of
    caffeinated commerce.

  # Garden-specific features
  garden_features:
    outdoor_seating: |
      Perfect for enjoying a coffee at the garden tables.
      The suspicious plant watches you drink.
      
    weather_protection: |
      A small awning extends automatically when rain is detected.
      Drinks arrive in sealed capsules for extra protection.
      
    flower_arrangement: |
      The roses around the terminal sometimes get coffee grounds
      as fertilizer. They seem to appreciate it.
      
  barista_garden_mode: |
    When ordering from the garden, the barista sometimes adds:
    - "Enjoying the fresh air? EXCELLENT FOR PRODUCTIVITY!"
    - "Garden order! Adding extra foam for outdoor ambience!"
    - "The roses say hello! ...I may have been alone too long."
    
  ambience: |
    Bees buzz around the roses. The tube occasionally whooshes.
    The speaker crackles: "Anyone want a refill? ...Hello?"
    A capsule sits in the chute, condensation forming on the glass.
    Someone ordered a cold brew and forgot about it. Classic.
