    One of the planters contains something... unusual. It's tall,
    leafy, and seems to turn toward you when you're not looking.
    
  examine: |
    It's definitely a plant. Definitely.
    
    Characteristics:
    • Tall (about 4 feet)
    • Leafy (big tropical-looking leaves)
    • Green (mostly)
    • Has what might be eyes (probably just flowers)
    • Is definitely not watching you (it was looking at that bird)
    
    A small wooden stake in the soil reads:
    "AUDREY II (rescued)"
    
    Wait, that's crossed out. Now it says:
    "PLANTY McPLANTFACE (harmless)"
    
    There's also a hand-lettered sign:
    "Please don't feed me. I'm on a diet."
    
    The plant rustles, though there's no wind.
    
  actions:
    TALK:

      effect: |
        The plant rustles attentively. Its leaves angle toward you.
        
        It doesn't respond verbally, but you get the distinct
        impression it's listening. And judging.
        
    FEED:

      warning: "The sign says not to..."
      effect: |
        The plant perks up IMMEDIATELY.
        
        Its leaves spread wide in what can only be described as
        enthusiasm. A tendril extends hopefully.
        
        A voice from the pub yells: "DON'T FEED THE PLANT!"
        
        The plant wilts theatrically.
        
    WATER:

      effect: |
        The plant sighs contentedly. Its leaves perk up.
        A small flower opens. It might be smiling?
        
        You've made a friend. A suspicious, definitely-not-carnivorous
        friend.
        
  secret:

    relationship_with_rocky: "Distant cousins (mineralogically speaking)"
