      This file was once 322 lines of fabulous fashion soul.
      All the costumes. All the transformation power.
      All the "honey, we are going to make you STUNNING."
      
      Now that soul lives in the proper place:
      characters/fictional/maurice/CHARACTER.yml
      
      Maurice is still here. Still magnificent.
      Still ready to help you find YOUR truth, gorgeous.
