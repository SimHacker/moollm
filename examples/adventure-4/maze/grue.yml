#   characters/fictional/grue/CHARACTER.yml — The non-soul
#   characters/fictional/grue/README.md — Human landing page
#
# The grue has no instances — it exists EVERYWHERE DARK.
# When your lamp dies, it's already there. It was always there.

# DARKNESS STATE — Where the grue can manifest

darkness:
  # Rooms that are ALWAYS dark (no windows, no permanent light)
  always_dark:
    - room-c    # The dark room
    - room-d    # Pit room
    - room-e    # Wumpus lair (but wumpus smell keeps grue out)

    - room-g    # Deep maze
    - room-i    # Skeleton room
    - room-j    # Vending machine alcove

  has_light:
    - room-a    # Entrance (daylight from above)

    - room-h    # The Eye sees (grue won't enter)
    
  # The Eye's domain — grue will NEVER enter
  forbidden:
    - room-h

  # Countdown:
  #   Turn 1 in dark: "You hear a faint rustling..."
  #   Turn 2 in dark: "Something brushes against you..."
  #   Turn 3 in dark: EATEN

# GRUE STATE — For this game session

grue_state:
  # The grue doesn't have a location — it's everywhere dark
  # But we track its "attention"
  focused_on: null     # Which adventurer has its attention
  last_meal: null      # When it last ate someone
  
  # Mood affects warning flavor text
  mood: hungry         # always hungry

# AVOIDANCE ZONES

avoids:
  wumpus_lair:
    room: room-e
    reason: "Too smelly even for darkness"
    
  the_eye:
    room: room-h
    reason: "The Eye sees through darkness itself"

# QUICK REFERENCE

invoke:
  - Light your lamp or be eaten
  - 3 turns in darkness = death
  - The Eye in room-h protects you
  - The wumpus's smell keeps grue from room-e
