    You enter a chamber that takes your breath away.
    
    Crystals. EVERYWHERE. Growing from the walls, the floor,
    the ceiling — luminescent formations that pulse with soft
    inner light. Blues, purples, pale greens. The light shifts
    and dances as you move, creating shadows that seem almost alive.
    
    The largest crystal cluster, in the center of the room, is
    taller than you. It hums faintly when you get close, a sound
    more felt than heard. Something about it feels... aware?
    
    The floor is uneven where crystals have pushed up through
    the rock. Watch your step.
    
  feature: crystals
  
  atmosphere:
    lighting: "Soft prismatic glow from crystal formations"
    sound: "Faint harmonic humming from the large cluster"
    smell: "Mineral, clean, ancient"
    temperature: "Cool but not cold"
    feeling: "Wonder, slight unease, beauty"

  ambience: |
    The crystals pulse in slow rhythms, like a geological heartbeat.
    You can almost believe they're alive. Perhaps they are, just
    on a timescale too slow for you to perceive.
    
    Something small and fast darts between the formations.
    A rat? In a place this beautiful?
    
  # BISCUIT'S MARKINGS (Session: Don's First Run)
  # RAT FORENSICS
  biscuit_markings:
    date: "2026-01-06"
    marked:
      - location: "a rock near the entrance (NOT the crystals)"
        type: territorial
        note: "Don said not to mark the crystals. I found a rock instead."
    detected_smells:
      - smell: "rat (recent)"
        location: "trail through the formations"
        assessment: |
          RAT. RAT! There was a RAT here. Recently.
          The rat went... this way... no wait... this way...
          it looped around... it was confused...
          then it left through that crack.
        tracking_complete: true
      - smell: "mineral, ancient"
        location: "the crystals"
        assessment: "Old. So old. The earth is dreaming here."
    crystal_interaction:
      considered_marking: true
      don_advised: "Maybe not that one"
      alternative_found: "Nearby rock — crystal will know by association"
    biscuit_says: |
      Pretty lights. Yes. But Don. DON.
      There was a RAT here.
      I know things. Nose things. The nose knows.

  # CAT MARKINGS (Midnight Prowl)
  cat_markings:
    date: "2026-01-06 (late night)"
    marks:
      - cat: "Lily"
        location: "Near entrance, elegant placement"
        note: "Admired crystals. Added delicate scent mark."
        
      - cat: "Pine"
        location: "By the rat trail (investigative marking)"
        note: |
          Followed Biscuit's rat documentation.
          Confirmed rat trail. Added analytical marking.
          "The dog's forensics were thorough. I concur."
          
      - cat: "Lemon"
        location: "Quick mark by big crystal"
        note: "Batted at crystal first. Then marked. Then GRASS."
        
      - cat: "Terpy Jr."
        location: "Licked a crystal, then marked nearby"
        note: "Crystal tasted weird. Marked out of confusion."
        
      - cat: "Hops"
        location: "Inspected crystal cleanliness, then proper mark"
        note: "Crystals passed inspection. Worthy of marking."
        
    rat_status: |
      Multiple cats confirmed Biscuit's rat detection.
      The rat has not returned. Probably smart.
      
    crystal_status: |
      Crystals remain unmarked (cats also respect them).
      Nearby rocks now smell like dog AND cat.
