      A jagged hole gapes near the east wall.
      Cold air rises from below. You can't see the bottom.
      The scratch marks on the wall suddenly make more sense.

  name: Twisty Passage (Scratch Marks)

  # What happens if you enter without light
  grue_event: |
    It is pitch black. You are likely to be eaten by a grue.
    
    You feel scratches on the wall. One of them seems to read
    "BEWARE THE GRU—" but you can't finish reading it.
    
    🎵 "Could be the spray for the grue; you're gonna need it if it is —
        a situation that reloads, restarts, or quits." 🎵

    You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
    
    This one has scratch marks on the walls — the desperate scribblings
    of previous adventurers trying to map their way out. Most of them
    are just tally marks. One reads "HELP". Another reads "DROPPED MY 
    SANDWICH HERE". Someone has helpfully written "THIS WAY OUT →" 
    with an arrow pointing at a solid wall.
    
    Passages lead in all directions. The scratch marks offer no clarity.

    You add your own mark to the wall. Future adventurers will wonder
    what "BUMBLEWICK WAS HERE (RELUCTANTLY)" means.
