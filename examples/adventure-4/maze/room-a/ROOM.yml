    You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
    
    Well, not ENTIRELY alike. This one is slightly damp. Water seeps
    through a crack in the ceiling, forming a small puddle that reflects
    your bewildered face back at you. The puddle seems judgmental.
    
    Passages lead in all directions. They all look the same.
    This is MOST irregular.

    south:
      destination: ../room-c/
      description: "A passage that looks exactly like all the others"
    east:
      destination: ../room-b/
      description: "A passage. Twisty. Little. You know the drill."
    west:

  # Distinguishing feature (for the observant)
  feature: puddle
  ambience: |
    Drip. Drip. Drip. The puddle grows imperceptibly larger.
    Or does it? Hard to tell. Everything is hard to tell in here.
    
  # BISCUIT'S MARKINGS (Session: Don's First Run)
  biscuit_markings:
    date: "2026-01-06"
    marked:
      - location: "near puddle"
        type: territorial
        note: "Junction marked — this is the crossroads"
    detected_smells:
      north: "dust — old and undisturbed"
      south: "lamplight and safety"
      east: "faint echo... sound has a smell?"
      west: "something OLD. Very old. Chose this direction."
    assessment: |
      SO MANY SMELLS. This is the best place.
      Every direction is a new smell.
      I need to investigate ALL of them.
    lamp_note: |
      Don kept the lamp lit throughout.
      Dogs scare grues too (they don't like barking),
      but we needed the light to SEE as well as to scare.
      Oil usage: moderate (worth it for safety AND visibility).
    biscuit_says: |
      The maze begins here. I have claimed the entrance.
      Future dogs will know: Biscuit explored this way.

    assessment: |
      Room-a is now THOROUGHLY claimed by the family.
      Biscuit's lamp note still applies — but now it's a
      family territory, not just dog territory.
