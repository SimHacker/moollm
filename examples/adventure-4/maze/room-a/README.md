# 💧 Room A — The Puddle

> *"You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike."*

A slightly damp passage. Water seeps through a crack in the ceiling, forming a small puddle that reflects your bewildered face back at you. The puddle seems judgmental.

The puddle catches lamp light and reflects it back at you. Good for checking your appearance. Bad for your self-esteem.
