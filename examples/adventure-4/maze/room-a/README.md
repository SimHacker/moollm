# 💧 Room A — The Puddle

> *"You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike."*

A slightly damp passage. Water seeps through a crack in the ceiling, forming a small puddle that reflects your bewildered face back at you. The puddle seems judgmental.

## 🎭 Feature: The Puddle

The puddle catches lamp light and reflects it back at you. Good for checking your appearance. Bad for your self-esteem.
