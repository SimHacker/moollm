  description: |
    The wumpus is a legendary beast — part rhino, part sloth, all danger.
    
    It has made its lair somewhere in the maze. It sleeps there, 
    filling the adjacent rooms with its terrible SMELL.
    
    Unlike the grue (which exists everywhere dark), the wumpus exists
    in ONE PLACE. It doesn't chase you. It doesn't need to.
    You will come to it. They always do.
    
    The wumpus is HUNTABLE. With the right weapon (crooked arrows),
    you can shoot into an adjacent room and kill it without entering.
    
    Or you can enter its room. Once.
    
  physical: |
    No one agrees on what a wumpus looks like. Descriptions include:
    - "A hairy orange beast with suckers on its feet"
    - "Something between a buffalo and a giant sloth"
    - "All I saw was teeth and then I was dead"
    
    What everyone agrees on:
    - It smells TERRIBLE (hence the warning)
    - It's heavy (the cave shakes when it moves)
    - It sleeps most of the time
    - It wakes up hungry
    
# WHERE IT EXISTS — Different from the grue!

location:
  type: fixed_lair       # NOT everywhere like the grue
  lair: maze/room-e      # Its chosen den (the cobweb room)
  territory: null        # It doesn't patrol — it WAITS
  
  # The wumpus STAYS in its room unless disturbed
  movement:
    default: stationary
    on_arrow_miss: |
      If you shoot a crooked arrow and MISS, the wumpus wakes up.
      It might move to an adjacent room. Or it might stay and wait
      for the fool who dared disturb its slumber.
    on_loud_noise: |
      Combat in adjacent rooms may wake the wumpus.
      A woken wumpus is a MOVING wumpus.
      
# WARNINGS — The classic Hunt the Wumpus mechanic

warnings:
  # These trigger when player is ADJACENT to a hazard
  
  wumpus_adjacent:
    trigger: "player in room adjacent to wumpus"
    message: "I smell a wumpus!"
    explanation: |
      The wumpus's terrible stench carries through the tunnels.
      This smell means the wumpus is ONE ROOM AWAY.
      You could shoot an arrow... or turn back... or push forward.
      
  # Other classic Hunt the Wumpus hazards (can be added to maze)
  pit_adjacent:
    trigger: "player in room adjacent to pit"
    message: "I feel a draft!"
    explanation: |
      A cold wind rises from below. A bottomless pit is nearby.
      Enter that room and you fall forever.
      
  bats_adjacent:
    trigger: "player in room adjacent to superbats"
    message: "Bats nearby!"
    explanation: |
      You hear the rustle of giant wings. Super-bats are close.
      They won't kill you — but they'll carry you to a random room.
      Maybe a safe room. Maybe the wumpus's lair. Who knows!

    - "I feel a draft!" (if pit adjacent)

    theme: "hunt or be hunted"
    
  coexistence: |
    The grue and wumpus can both exist in the same maze:
    
    - Grue forces you to keep your lamp lit
    - Wumpus forces you to navigate carefully
    - Running from one may lead you to the other
    - The grue won't enter the wumpus's lair (too smelly even for darkness)
    - The wumpus ignores the grue (can't eat what you can't see)
    
    WORST CASE: Your lamp dies adjacent to the wumpus room.
    Do you stumble into the wumpus, or wait for the grue?

# CROOKED ARROWS — The hunting mechanic

crooked_arrows:
  description: |
    Crooked arrows are the traditional weapon for wumpus hunting.
    They can navigate the twisting caves, turning corners that
    straight arrows cannot. Named for their ability to change
    direction while in flight.
    
  # === ORIGINAL 1973 MECHANICS ===
  # Faithful to Gregory Yob's design
  
  classic_usage: |
    SHOOT [number_of_rooms] [room_sequence]
    
    Example: SHOOT 3 → 5 → 7 → 9
    
    The arrow travels through up to 5 rooms in sequence.
    You specify the path by naming the rooms you want it to pass through.
    
  path_rules:
    valid_path: |
      If the next room IS connected to the current room,
      the arrow goes there.
    invalid_path: |
      If the next room is NOT connected (no tunnel),
      the arrow picks a random valid direction instead.
      "ARROWS AREN'T THAT CROOKED" — can't backtrack immediately.
    max_range: 5  # rooms per shot
    
  outcomes:
    hit_wumpus: "WIN — You killed the wumpus!"
    hit_self: "LOSE — Your own arrow got you!"
    miss: |
      The arrow clatters into empty cave.
      "MISSED"
      The wumpus WAKES.
      75% chance: wumpus moves to adjacent room.
      25% chance: wumpus stays put.
      If wumpus moves to YOUR room: "TSK TSK TSK- WUMPUS GOT YOU!"
    
  inventory: 5  # Traditional count from Hunt the Wumpus
  
  # === SIMPLIFIED MOOLLM USAGE ===
  # For adventure-4, we simplify to single-room shots
  
  simple_usage: |
    SHOOT [direction]
    
    The arrow flies into the adjacent room in that direction.
    If the wumpus is there: hit! The wumpus dies.
    If the wumpus is NOT there: miss. The wumpus wakes and may move.

# LORE

lore:
  origin: |
    Hunt the Wumpus was created by Gregory Yob in 1973.
    It was one of the first games to feature:
    - Non-grid-based topology (dodecahedron map)
    - Indirect information (warnings from adjacent rooms)
    - Risk/reward hunting mechanics
    
    The wumpus became a gaming icon, referenced in everything
    from Nethack to Inform to this very adventure.
    
  name_etymology: |
    "Wumpus" has no meaning. Yob made it up.
    It sounds vaguely threatening, vaguely silly.
    That's the wumpus in a nutshell.
    
  legacy: |
    Every game with "nearby" warnings owes something to the wumpus.
    "I smell a wumpus" is gaming's original environmental storytelling.
    
# META

meta:
  role: boss_monster
  threat_level: lethal
  can_be_killed: true     # Unlike the grue!
  can_be_avoided: true    # Don't enter its room
  
  invoke_when:
    - "player adjacent to wumpus room"
    - "player shoots arrow"
    - "player asks about wumpus"
    - "wumpus smell warning needed"
    
  integration_with_grue: |
    Both can run simultaneously:
    
    GRUE checks: Is player in dark? Start countdown.
    WUMPUS checks: Is player adjacent? Give smell warning.
    
    They don't interfere — different threat models:
    - Grue = time pressure (keep lamp lit)
    - Wumpus = spatial pressure (navigate carefully)
    
    The maze becomes a dance between light management
    and room-by-room deduction.
    
  effects:
    on_adjacent_rooms:
      - "I smell a wumpus!" warning
      - "Tension: wumpus is ONE ROOM away"
    on_lair_room:
      - "Instant death on entry"
      - "Victory if arrow hits"
    on_players:
      - "Deduction puzzle: where is it?"
      - "Resource management: arrows are limited"
      - "Risk assessment: shoot or scout?"
