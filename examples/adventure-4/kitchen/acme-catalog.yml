  description: |
    A dog-eared catalog sits on the counter, its cover showing a
    smiling coyote giving a thumbs up. The ACME logo gleams.
    
    Someone left this here. It's been read many times — the pages
    are soft with handling, corners folded, margins annotated.
    
    "ORDER ANYTHING! DELIVERED IN 2-4 TURNS!"
    
    (For full catalog contents, see the prototype.)

    This copy has been personalized:
    - Someone circled "ACME Portable Hole" with three stars
    - "DO NOT ORDER" is written next to Rocket Skates
    - The Mystery Box page is... missing? Torn out?
    - There's a coffee ring on the Disguises section
    
    The coyote on the cover seems tired. Understanding.
