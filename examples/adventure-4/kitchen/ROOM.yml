    You stand in a cozy kitchen that feels oddly familiar — perhaps because
    it's an EXACT replica of the Fantastipants family kitchen from 
    Wobblebrook-upon-Squiggle. Someone has gone to considerable trouble
    to recreate it underground, right down to the motivational embroidery
    that reads "BLESS THIS MESS (BUT ALSO CLEAN IT UP, BUMBLEWICK)".
    
    A REFRIGERATOR hums contentedly in the corner, stuffed with provisions.
    A STOVE sits cold and patient. A SINK contains the eternal mystery
    of dishes that weren't there a moment ago. A TABLE holds a note,
    a notebook, a lunchbox, and something that chirps.
    
    A long granite COUNTER runs along one wall, shimmering slightly.
    It's a CRAFTING TABLE — for combining, transforming, and creating things.
    
    By the door, a brass MAILBOX is mounted on the wall. The Fantastipants
    Dungeon Delivery Service has been running since 1876. Write to anyone,
    anywhere — Mother, the skeleton's family, even historical adventurers.
    
    In the corner, a TRASH CAN lurks. It's deeper than it looks.
    
    The exit EAST leads to the pub's garden — outdoor dining!
    The exit NORTHEAST is a staff shortcut diagonally to the pub bar.
    
    (Kitchen is WEST of Garden, so exit EAST goes to Garden.)

        The garden gate leads to the pub's back garden — tables,
        chairs, flowers, and the comforting smell of ale from the pub.
        The outdoor dining area. Your domain.
        
    northeast:

      description: |
        A narrow service corridor cuts diagonally through to the pub.
        Swinging doors, worn smooth by decades of servers carrying trays.
        The smell of ale grows stronger. You can hear the murmur of
        patrons and the clink of glasses.

  ambience: |
    The fridge hums. A clock ticks somewhere. The smell of home cooking
    lingers, though nothing is cooking. It's the MEMORY of cooking.
    
    This kitchen exists specifically so you have food to drop in the maze.
    We're not being subtle about it.
