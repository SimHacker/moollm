## 🌿 LOOK AROUND

You push open the heavy wooden door and step into the Gezelligheid Grotto.

The warmth hits you first — not just temperature, but *feeling*. This place is aggressively cozy in the best possible way. The Dutch have a word for it: **gezellig**. It means something between "cozy," "convivial," and "belonging." This room IS that word.

### What You See:

**THE BAR** (to your left)
Behind a long, polished wooden counter stands **Marieke van der Berg**, a woman in her 40s with laugh lines that tell stories. Her apron says "Lekker" and she means it. Behind her, a gleaming copper espresso machine from 1952 hisses softly. Bottles of every description line the shelves. The air smells of coffee, cannabis, and something that might be stroopwafels.

She catches your eye and nods. *"Welkom, schat. What can I get you?"*

**THE STAGE** (far end)
A raised wooden platform, maybe two feet up. A single spotlight hangs overhead, slightly askew. Faded burgundy curtains at the back. A sign reads:

```
🎭 TONIGHT: OPEN MIC COMEDY NIGHT
Sign up at bar. 5 min sets. Everyone bombs once.
— Marieke
```

It's Freeday. Comedy night. The mic stands ready.

**THE PIE TABLE** (center-right)
A large, round table with eight chairs, scarred by countless debates. A small brass bell sits in the center. This is where ideas come to fight — sportingly.

**THE FIREPLACE** (right wall)
A crackling fire in a massive stone hearth. The hearthstone has an inscription you can't quite read from here. Several worn armchairs cluster around it.

**THE GAMES CORNER** (left, past the bar)
Dart board. Chess table (mid-game abandoned). Card decks. A shelf of Fluxx boxes.

**THE ARCADE** (back left)
Glowing screens. The *chirp-bloop* of old machines. A fruit machine called "Goblin's Fortune." A Pac-Man cabinet. Someone's high score reads "GRM."

**THE CATS**
They're everywhere. A large orange tabby (**Terpie**) sprawls across a sunny windowsill, not moving. A sleek calico (**Stroopwafel**) prowls behind the bar. You count at least five kittens in various states of activity — one is definitely on the ceiling somehow.

**THE NOTICE BOARD** (near entrance)
Covered in papers. Quests? Jobs? At least one says "ACME" and has scorch marks.

**OTHER PATRONS**
- A man in a worn coat nursing what might be his sixth espresso (**Henk**). A kitten sits in his lap.
- A few clusters at tables, conversations low and warm.
- Someone tuning a guitar near the stage.

## What Would You Like To Do?

The Grotto awaits. Marieke is watching. A kitten is approaching your ankles.

*"First time here?"* she asks, sliding a menu across the counter. *"Or are you coming back to somewhere you've always been?"*
