### The Exits

| Direction | Destination | What Awaits |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **NORTH** | [maze/](./maze/) | Darkness. The grue has respawned. |
| **SOUTH** | [pub/](./pub/) | The Gezelligheid Grotto — coffeeshop vibes |
| **WEST** | [kitchen/](./kitchen/) | Mother's note. TomTomagotchi. Food. |

| **INWARD** | [characters/](./characters/) | The Hall of Bodies (metaphysical) |

### The Pub Has Changed

The **Gezelligheid Grotto** is now the **Gezelligheid Grotto** — an Amsterdam-style coffeeshop with:

- 🌿 **Marieke** the budtender
- 🐱 **The Cat Cave** with 10 cats (Terpie, Stroopwafel, and the Terpene Litter)
- 🥧 **The Pie Menu Round Table** for structured debates
- 🔔 **The Gong of Gezelligheid** for attention and mercy
