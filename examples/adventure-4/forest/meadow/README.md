# 🌿 The Forest Meadow

> Sun-drenched. Waist-high grass. Wildflowers that look like pie menus.

A hidden meadow deep within the ancient forest. Poppies, lavender, daisies, and small blue flowers with an oddly radial shape. Butterflies. Herbs — rosemary, thyme. The air is warm and the light is golden.

No grue here. The sun keeps them away.
