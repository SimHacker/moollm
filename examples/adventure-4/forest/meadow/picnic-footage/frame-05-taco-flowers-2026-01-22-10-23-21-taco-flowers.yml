  Extreme macro photography of exotic 'Taco Flowers' in a meadow. The flowers have yellow-gold petals shaped like crunchy taco shells, with red and green stamens inside. A large fuzzy bumblebee is crawling inside a taco flower, covered in orange pollen. Another bee is in mid-air. In the soft-focus foreground, a silver tray of actual tacos is visible. Saturated colors, bright morning sunlight, high detail, sharp focus on the bee and flower petals.
