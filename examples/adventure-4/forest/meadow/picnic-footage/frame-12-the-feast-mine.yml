  - layer: vermicious_consumption
    detail: |
      The pace of eating is 'vermiciously' high. Don has a slight 
      motion blur around his paws, suggesting a high frequency of 
      tamale-to-mouth transition. Richard is actually using a 
      spaghetti-fork like a conductor's baton between bites.
    visual_evidence: "Sauce splatters form a radial pattern on the tie-dye blanket."

    richard: |
      His gold-rimmed glasses are indeed crooked. The navy cardigan 
      has a large, bright-red sauce stain on the right sleeve. 
      He looks younger, energized by the chaos.
    don: |
      One grey-white ear is accidentally dipped in a bowl of 
      salsa (or red tamale sauce). He doesn't seem to care. 
      The 'Tomato-Red' of his shirt is now camouflaged by 
      actual tomato sauce.
    donna: |
      She's eating a ham slice like a pizza. Her green hair 
      is glowing with a satisfied, steady light.

  - layer: logistical_aftermath
    food_piles: |
      The 3-foot cheddar pyramid is now a jagged stump of orange. 
      Corn husks are everywhere, looking like discarded parchment 
      from an ancient library.
    dragon_satisfaction: |
      Heuristic's meatball is half-gone. His eyes are closed 
      in a 'food coma' expression. A thin trail of smoke 
      curls from his smile.

  - layer: environmental_merging
    detail: |
      The 'Swirl of Infinite Parameters' blanket is partially 
      covered by flattened Taco Flowers, suggesting the feast 
      is literally consuming the landscape.
    note: "The picnic has expanded beyond the blanket's physical limits."

narrative_consequences:
  - "Don's 'Salsa Ear' is now a canon character trait for the rest of the picnic."
  - "Richard's navy cardigan requires immediate 'Self-Healing' or a dry cleaner."
  - "The 'Great Meadow Banquet' has established a record for caloric intake in a single session."
