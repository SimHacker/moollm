    As the pioneers feast on actual tacos, they notice the meadow 
    is full of 'Taco Flowers' (Anthotaco bellus). These extraordinary 
    plants have yellow-gold petals that curve upward like crisp 
    tortilla shells, containing a 'filling' of vibrant red and green 
    stamens.
    
    The meadow is buzzing. Large, fuzzy bumblebees are diving into 
     the flowers, their legs laden with bright orange pollen. The 
    bees seem particularly attracted to the 'Taco Flowers' that 
    grow near the 'Swirl of Infinite Parameters' blanket.

    - THE FLOWERS: A cluster of 'Taco Flowers'. Yellow-gold, shell-shaped 
      petals. Interior features dark red 'meat' stamens and bright 
      green 'lettuce' leaves at the base of the bloom.
    - THE BEES: Two large, fuzzy bumblebees. One is half-submerged in 
      a Taco Flower shell; the other is in mid-flight, hovering 
      between a blue pie-menu flower and a red poppy.
    - BACKGROUND: A tray of actual Leela tacos sits in the soft-focus 
      foreground, creating a visual rhyme between nature and catering.
    - LIGHTING: Bright, direct sunlight highlighting the fuzz on the 
      bees and the texture of the 'taco shell' petals.

    A feast of exotic 'TACO FLOWERS' in a sun-drenched meadow. 
    The flowers have yellow-gold petals that are curved and 
    textured exactly like crunchy taco shells. Inside the 'shell' 
    petals are vibrant dark red stamens and delicate bright 
    green leaves.
    
    POLLINATORS:
    - A large, fuzzy BUMBLEBEE with gold and black stripes is 
      crawling inside one of the taco-shell flowers, its legs 
      covered in bright orange pollen dust.
    - Another bee is in mid-air, wings blurred, hovering near 
      a bright red poppy.
    
    THE CONTEXT:
    - In the soft-focus foreground, a silver tray holding actual 
      tacos with shredded cheese is visible, creating a visual 
      pun.
    - Saturated colors: gold, red, green, and the azure sky 
      reflected in the silver tray.
    - Sunlight highlights the iridescent wings of the bees and 
      the crystalline texture of the pollen.
    
    STYLE: National Geographic style macro photography, high
