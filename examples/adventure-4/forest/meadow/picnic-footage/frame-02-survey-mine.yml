    richard: |
      Standing near the center of the Study's mahogany roof. He looks 
      stately, his navy cardigan providing a sharp contrast to the 
      golden wood. His silver hair catches the full morning sun.
    don: |
      Standing near the front edge of the FMC's roof. The grey-white 
      rabbit ears are bolt-upright. His red hibiscus shirt is almost 
      the same shade as the poppies below.
    emergent_tech: |
      The FMC's roof features a row of small, flexible solar panels 
      mounted just behind the A/C unit. They are currently trickle-charging 
      the domestic bank.

  - layer: meadow_micro_details
    heuristic: |
      The dragon is visible in the lower foreground, barely peeking over 
      the tall grass. Its amber color makes it look like a very large, 
      very curious butterfly from this angle.
    flora: |
      The 'pie menu' blue flowers mentioned in the ROOM.yml are 
      visible from above as small, radial clusters of blue petals.

  - layer: depth_and_scale
    detail: |
      The scale of the trees is immense; the vehicles and the people 
      on top of them look like toys in a giant's garden. 
    visual_evidence: "The pine trees are at least five times the height of the motorcoach."

narrative_consequences:
  - "The FMC's solar capability is now canon."
  - "The 'Rooftop Survey' is established as a shared pioneer ritual."
  - "Richard and Don are now 'High-Level Observation Characters'."
