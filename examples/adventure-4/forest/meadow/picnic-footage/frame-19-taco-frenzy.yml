    Donna Toadstool has abandoned the 'Star' posture for pure, 
    unfiltered hunger. She is kneeling in the tall grass, 
    double-fisting 'Taco Flowers' (Anthotaco bellus). 
    
    Her face is a mask of tangerine-orange foundation and 
    determined gluttony. She is chomping down on a large 
    yellow-gold petal 'shell', orange pollen dusting her 
    upper lip like a neon moustache. Crimson 'meat' stamens 
    are spilling from her mouth. 
    
    She is "grabbing 'em by the taco" in the most literal, 
    visceral sense. The gender-bending drag king is at her 
    most intense, performance and appetite merged into one.

    - DONNA: Extreme close-up. Nuclear tangerine skin, 
      sentient straw-yellow combover (slightly disheveled now). 
      She is mid-chomp on a large yellow Taco Flower.
    - ACTION: "Stuffing her face." Both hands holding multiple 
      blooms. Orange pollen smears on her cheeks and lip. 
      Aggressive, joyful, ravenous expression.
    - TACO FLOWERS: Detailed yellow shell-petals, dark red 
      stamens, green leafy bases. One is partially crushed 
      between her teeth.
    - THE SUIT: The navy lapel and red tie are visible at the 
      bottom of the frame, already starting to collect pollen 
      and flower bits.

    Extreme close-up photography, shallow depth of field. A woman 
    in full bombastic drag king impersonation (Donna Toadstool) 
    is ravenously eating yellow-gold flowers shaped like tacos.
    
    DONNA (MACRO PERFORMANCE):
    - Face: RADIOACTIVE TANGERINE skin, thick and streaky. 
      White 'reverse raccoon' circles around alert eyes.
    - Hair: Massive STRAW-YELLOW COMBOVER swoop, slightly 
      mussed by the frenzy.
    - Action: Mid-chomp on a yellow 'Taco Flower'. Her mouth 
      is full, with red stamens and green leaves visible. 
      Bright NEON ORANGE POLLEN is smeared on her upper lip 
      like a moustache.
    - Hands: Small hands with thick beige makeup are stuffing 
      multiple taco-shaped blooms into her mouth.
    
    THE FOOD (MACRO):
    - TACO FLOWERS: Crunchy-textured yellow-gold petals, deep 
      crimson 'meat' centers, and vibrant green 'lettuce' bases. 
    - Textures: Toasted petal edges, glistening red stamens, 
      fuzzy bee-pollen dust.
    
    STYLE: Visceral action-comedy macro photography. High 
    contrast, saturated colors (orange, gold, crimson, green). 
    Bright direct sunlight highlighting the mess. 15:55 timestamp.
