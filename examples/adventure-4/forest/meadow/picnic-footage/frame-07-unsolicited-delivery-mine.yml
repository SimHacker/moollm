fordite_layers:

  - layer: acme_product_manifestation
    dehydrated_feast: |
      The cubes are geometric, with a rubbery, synthetic texture. 
      The pile is already 4 feet tall and growing. One cube has 
      landed in Richard's tea (unfortunate).
    inflatable_donna: |
      The decoy is made of high-gloss red and black vinyl. Her 
      'hair' is a rigid plastic crown. The smile is unsettlingly 
      wide, revealing painted teeth.
    pocket_black_hole: |
      The grass around the tiny black sphere is literally bent 
      into a whirlpool shape. One block of cheddar is mid-air, 
      stretching as it gets pulled in (spaghettification).

  - layer: character_trajectories
    richard: |
    His navy blue cardigan is dusted with fine grey powder from 
    the dehydrated cubes. He is reaching for a heavy book to use 
    as a shield (or a blunt instrument).
    don: |
      He is in a full horizontal lunge across the tie-dye blanket. 
      One paw is inches away from the cheddar. His ears are swept 
      back by the 'gravity wind' of the black hole.
    heuristic: |
      His amber scales are pulsing with a deep red internal heat. 
      Smoke is coming from his ears as he prepares to blast the decoy.

  - layer: environmental_collision
    detail: |
      The ACME truck's red paint is so reflective it's showing the 
      entire meadow panorama, but the reflection is low-resolution 
      (8-bit style), confirming its glitchy status.
    visual_evidence: "Pixelated reflection on the truck's rear door."

narrative_consequences:
  - "The 'Dehydrated Feast' is a biohazard level event for the picnic."
  - "Heuristic's 'Internal Heat' pulse is a new draconic stat."
  - "Don's cheese-saving lunge is a legendary feat of Socializer agility."
