  A woman with bright orange skin and a large swoop of yellow hair is stepping out of a white 1970s bus in a meadow. She is holding a yellow flower she just picked from the grass. A man with rabbit ears stands by the bus. An elderly man with silver hair is in the background. Saturated colors, sunny day, high detail.
