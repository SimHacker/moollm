  Extreme macro close-up, shallow depth of field. A cluster of small, vibrant blue flowers with petals arranged in a perfect radial 'pie-menu' pattern. Beside them, a single, velvety bright red poppy with a dark black center. The snout of a small AMBER DRAGON with metallic shimmering scales is leaning into the frame from the top left, sniffing the flowers. A vibrant neon-blue BUTTERFLY is perched on a thick block of bright orange CHEDDAR CHEESE at the bottom. The background is a vibrant tie-dye pattern of neon purple and teal. Saturated colors, sharp focus, cinematic nature photography.
