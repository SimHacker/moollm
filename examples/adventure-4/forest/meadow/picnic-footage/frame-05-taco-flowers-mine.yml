    detail: |
      The 'Taco Flower' petals have a corn-like texture, including 
      minute ridges and a slight toasted-brown edge that perfectly 
      simulates a crispy shell. The 'meat' stamens are a deep, 
      marbled crimson.
    visual_evidence: "Toasted-brown gradient on the edges of the yellow petals."

  - layer: pollinator_dynamics
    detail: |
      The bumblebee is a 'Giant Meadow Fuzzy' (Bombus grandis). 
      Its orange pollen baskets are overflowing, creating a dust 
      cloud of neon orange that contrasts with the blue pie-menu 
      flowers in the soft-focus background.
    emergent_detail: "The bee's wings show a holographic Moire pattern."

  - layer: gastronomic_rhyme
    detail: |
      The actual tacos in the foreground are indistinguishable in 
      form from the flowers, save for the presence of the silver 
      serving tray. Nature and the Leela catalog have achieved 
      perfect visual alignment.
    note: "The 'Taco-to-Taco' ratio in this meadow is approximately 1:47."

  - layer: micro_lighting
    detail: |
      Individual grains of orange pollen are visible on the 
      green 'lettuce' leaves at the base of the flower, glowing 
      like tiny embers in the direct sunlight.

narrative_consequences:
  - "Taco Flowers (Anthotaco bellus) are now a foundational species of the Forest Meadow."
  - "The 'Giant Meadow Fuzzy' bumblebee is the primary pollinator of the namespace."
  - "Pollen from Taco Flowers is confirmed to be neon orange and highly visible."
