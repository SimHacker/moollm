  - layer: gastronomic_immersion
    cheddar: |
      The cheese pyramid is approximately 15 blocks high, stacked 
      with architectural precision. The orange is 'Nuclear Saffron,' 
      vibrant enough to be seen from the forest edge.
    spaghetti: |
      The meatballs are the size of tennis balls. The sauce is a 
      deep, glossy umber-red. 
    tacos: |
      Silver trays reflect the azure sky, giving the lettuce and 
      cheese inside a metallic, high-fidelity sheen.

  - layer: character_posture
    richard: |
      Leaning forward with scholarly grace as he adjusts a table 
      setting. The navy cardigan looks heavy and warm in the meadow breeze.
    don: |
      His grey-white ears are tilted backward slightly — the 'Focus 
      on Food' configuration. His red hibiscus shirt provides a 
      visual bridge between the poppies and the cheese blocks.
    heuristic: |
      Sitting upright, chest out, wings slightly flared. He looks 
      less like a pet and more like a 'Gourmet Guardian.'

  - layer: environmental_merging
    blanket: |
      The tie-dye blanket features a 'Swirl of Infinite Parameters' 
      pattern: neon purple, teal, and lime green. It seems to repel 
      the grass, creating a clean circular island for the food.
    tables: |
      The mahogany wood of the tuckaway tables matches the Study's 
      exterior perfectly, implying they are transclusions of the 
      Study's own interior identity.

  - layer: background_continuity
    detail: |
      The FMC's door is open, showing a glimpse of the 'Carrot Cooler' 
      inside. The Study's door reveals the 'Spaghetti Sideboard' is 
      ready for leftovers.

narrative_consequences:
  - "The 'Swirl of Infinite Parameters' is the official picnic pattern."
  - "Heuristic has been promoted to 'Gourmet Guardian' of the spaghetti."
  - "The cheddar pyramid is a new landmark in the meadow namespace."
