  High-angle cinematic action shot of a chaotic ACME delivery in a meadow. A battered red truck has spilled crates. A mountain of gray food cubes is expanding from one box. A wobbly inflatable decoy of a woman (Donna) is half-inflated. A tiny black sphere on the grass is sucking in nearby orange cheese blocks. An elderly man with silver hair and a man with rabbit ears are in the scene, reacting in shock. A small amber dragon growls. Vibrant flowers, blue sky, high detail.
