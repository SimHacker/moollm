    The Fabergé TARDIS isn't just a vehicle; it's a factory. 
    
    From the violet portal, a series of brass and steel conveyor 
    belts have unfolded, extending across the meadow like the 
    tentacles of a sophisticated organism. Inserter robots — 
    resembling golden mechanical arms with claw-hands — have 
    sprouted along the line.
    
    Out roll hundreds of steaming tamales, each perfectly wrapped 
    in a corn husk. The Inserters move with mathematical precision, 
    plucking the tamales and plopping them onto porcelain plates 
    already laden with Mexican rice, refried beans, and a 
    deluge of melted orange cheddar.
    
    Don is laughing, ears flapping in the wind generated by the 
    belts. Richard is taking notes on the 'Factorio-style' logistics. 
    Donna is overseeing the sauce-dispensing unit with a 
    Quality Control grin.

    - THE EGG: Open wide, serving as the source of the belts.
    - THE CONVEYOR: Multiple lanes of brass belts carrying 
      steaming tamales in corn husks.
    - THE INSERTERS: Golden robot arms (Factorio-style) plucking 
      items and placing them on plates.
    - THE MEAL: Plates with tamales, red rice, beans, melted 
      cheddar, and deep red tamale sauce.
    - THE CHARACTERS:
      - DON: Cheering by the FMC, ears in 'Excitement' mode.
      - RICHARD: Examining an Inserter arm with his magnifying glass.
      - DONNA: Adjusting a nozzle on a sauce-dispenser robot.
      - HEURISTIC: Sitting on a pile of empty crates, watching 
        a tamale go past his nose.
    - BACKGROUND: The sun is bright, the meadow flowers are 
      still blooming around the factory floor.

    High-angle cinematic action shot. A futuristic automation 
    assembly line is operating in a sunny forest meadow.
    
    THE FACTORY:
    - Brass and steel conveyor belts are folding out of a 
      large, open 12-foot Fabergé Egg.
    - Robotic arms (golden Inserters) are plucking steaming 
      tamales wrapped in corn husks from the belts.
    - The robots are placing the tamales onto plates already 
      filled with Mexican rice, refried beans, and melted 
      orange cheddar cheese.
    - A specialized robot is drizzling red tamale sauce.
    
    THE PEOPLE:
    - Dr. RICHARD BARTLE (silver hair, navy cardigan) is 
      studying a robotic arm closely.
    - DON HOPKINS (rabbit ears, red Hawaiian shirt) is 
      celebrating next to a white motorcoach.
    - A woman with glowing green hair (Donna) is overseeing 
      the machinery.
    
    THE ENVIRONMENT:
    - Lush meadow with red poppies and blue flowers.
    - Deep blue sky with fluffy white clouds.
    - Saturated colors, steam rising from the hot food, 
      mechanical motion blur on the belts.
    
    STYLE: Factorio-meets-Faberge aesthetic. Industrial 
    automation in a natural setting. High detail, sharp focus.
