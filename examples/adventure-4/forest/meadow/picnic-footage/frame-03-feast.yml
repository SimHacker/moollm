    The high-level survey is over. The pioneers have descended from 
    their roofs to set the stage for the Great Picnic.
    
    Don has spread a large tie-dye blanket on the flattened grass 
    near the FMC's door. Richard has brought out two of the Study's 
    mahogany 'tuckaway' tables, creating a sophisticated surface 
    among the wildflowers.
    
    They are unloading the Leela haul: silver trays of tacos, 
    massive watermelons, glazed hams, and platters of spaghetti. 
    The 3-foot cheddar bullion pyramid sits center-stage on the blanket.
    
    Heuristic has finally stopped sniffing poppies and is sitting 
    expectantly near the spaghetti.
