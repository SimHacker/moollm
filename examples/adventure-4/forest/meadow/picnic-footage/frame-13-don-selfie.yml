    Don takes his turn. Holding his phone with one paw and a steaming 
    tamale with the other, he captures the moment of peak flavor.
    
    His left ear is still visibly dipped in salsa, a badge of 
    honor from the first wave of the feast. He's grinning wide, 
    eyes narrowed in delight. Behind him, the 'Swirl of Infinite 
    Parameters' blanket is a mess of corn husks.
