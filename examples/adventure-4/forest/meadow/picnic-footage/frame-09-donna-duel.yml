    The real Donna Toadstool has stepped out from the shadows of the 
    ancient oak, looking absolutely livid at the sight of the 
    'Inflatable Donna Decoy'. 
    
    The decoy, though partially melted and smoking from Heuristic's 
    earlier blast, has glitched into a new, defensive state. It has 
    assumed a wobbly, cylindrical shape resembling a vintage 1970s 
    McDonald's trash can, complete with a swinging 'push' door on its 
    front, but still sporting a small, defiant red tie.
    
    The real Donna is delivering a high-speed series of punches to the 
    vinyl surface, while the Decoy swings back with its wobbly, 
    unpredictable inflatable 'arms'. It's a slapstick confrontation 
    of ego vs. industrial error.
    
    Richard and Don are watching from a safe distance, Don holding 
    the saved cheddar bullion like a trophy.

    - THE REAL DONNA: Sharp, high-detail rendering. Punk-queen attire: 
      black leather, studs, glowing green hair highlights. She is in 
      mid-swing, punching the decoy.
    - THE DECOY DONNA: A glitched, wobbly cylinder made of red and 
      black vinyl. It looks like a character-shaped trash can with a 
      swinging door mouth. It's wearing a small red silk tie. It has 
      8-bit 'jitter' artifacts around its edges.
    - THE FIGHT: Slapstick motion blur. The decoy is bouncing back 
      like a punching bag after every hit.
    - THE PIONEERS:
      - DON: Standing near the FMC, holding a block of cheddar. 
        Expression of amused disbelief.
      - RICHARD: Standing by his table, adjusted glasses, watching 
        the 'Trash Can' with profound curiosity.
    - BACKGROUND: The smoke from the ACME truck is almost gone.

    THE COMBATANTS:
    - A sharp, high-resolution woman with glowing green hair and 
      black punk leather (Real Donna) is punching a wobbly, 
      inflatable vinyl cylinder.
    - The inflatable cylinder (Decoy) is red and black, shaped 
      like a vintage 1970s fast-food trash can with a swinging door 
      'mouth'. It is wearing a comical red necktie.
    - The decoy is bouncing back like a punching bag.
    
    THE OBSERVERS:
    - An elderly man in a navy cardigan and a man with rabbit ears 
      and a Hawaiian shirt are watching from the side, holding 
      blocks of orange cheese.
    - A small amber dragon is watching from the grass.
    
    THE ENVIRONMENT:
    - Lush forest meadow, bright sunlight, blue sky.
    - Spilled ACME boxes and a red truck in the background.
    
    STYLE: Action photography with motion blur. High contrast 
    between the 'real' woman and the 'glitchy' vinyl trash can.
