    The peace of the meadow is shattered. 
    
    One of the ancient oaks at the edge of the forest has 
    un-rendered its bark, revealing a flat, two-dimensional 
    'Painted Tunnel' exactly like the one across the street 
    from Leela. 
    
    With a roar of a poorly-tuned engine and a cloud of 
    black exhaust, a battered ACME Delivery Truck bursts 
    out of the tree-trunk. It skids across the wildflowers, 
    heading straight for the picnic.
    
    Richard is protectively clutching his tea. Don has 
    jumped to his feet, ears forward, ready to debug 
    the spatial anomaly. Heuristic has taken a defensive 
    pose in front of the spaghetti, a small warning 
    flame flickering in his throat.
    
  scene_description: |
    - THE ANOMALY: A large oak tree with a cartoonish 'Painted Tunnel' 
      on its trunk. An ACME truck is emerging from the 'flat' surface.
    - THE GUEST: A battered, red ACME Delivery Truck. 'ACME SURPLUS' 
      is stenciled on the door. It's smoking and missing a headlight.
    - THE REACTION:
      - DON: Mid-jump, pointing at the truck. Expression of shock.
      - RICHARD: Seated at the mahogany table, holding his white tea 
        cup with both hands. He looks remarkably calm but firm.
      - HEURISTIC: Wings flared, tail lashing the grass, eyes 
        glowing.
    - BACKGROUND: The Study and FMC are visible, their stable 
      geometry contrasting with the glitchy, rattling ACME intruder.
    - THE MEADOW: Grass and Taco Flowers are being flattened by 
      the truck's skidding tires.
