    VISUAL LANGUAGE:
    - High-detail nature rendering: blades of grass, petal textures.
    - Volumetric lighting: sunlight filtering through trees.
    - Sharp contrast between the artificial shells and the organic flora.
    - Cinematic wide-angle lens.
    
    THE VEHICLES IN NATURE:
    - The Study looks like a misplaced museum exhibit, yet at home.
    - The FMC #898 looks like it finally found its intended coordinate system.
    - No concrete. No glass walls. Just dirt and dreams.
