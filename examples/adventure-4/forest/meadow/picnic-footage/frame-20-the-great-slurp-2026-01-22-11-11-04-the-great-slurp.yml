  A massive dark tornado in a forest meadow is sucking up a picnic. Piles of food like watermelons and tacos are flying in the air. A white bus and a Victorian room are being lifted off the ground by the wind. Three people and a small dragon are caught in the swirling debris, floating upward. Bright sun, dark funnel cloud, high contrast, cinematic motion blur.
