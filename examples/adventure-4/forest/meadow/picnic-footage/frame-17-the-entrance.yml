    The FMC door swings open wide. A cloud of hairspray and Diet Coke 
    fumes billows out.
    
    Donna Toadstool steps onto the gravel-and-grass threshold. 
    The transition is complete.
    
    The SKIN: Radioactive orange, applied with a paint roller.
    The HAIR: A straw-yellow architectural triumph, shellacked 
    into a gravity-defying combover.
    The SUIT: Ill-fitting navy blue, straining at the buttons.
    The TIE: Aggressively red, hanging past the belt.
    
    She strikes the Mussolini pose — chin jutted, forward lean, 
    thumbs and forefingers pinched.
    
    "Many people are saying this is the best picnic in the history 
    of picnics," she bellows. "TREMENDOUS tamales."

    - DONNA: Full drag king impersonation. Nuclear tangerine skin, 
      impossible straw-yellow hair, red power tie. She is standing 
      on the step of the FMC, leaning forward aggressively.
    - THE PIONEERS:
      - DON: Applauding with his paws.
      - RICHARD: Holding his magnifying glass, studying the hair 
        structure with scientific wonder.
    - HEURISTIC: Has taken a seat on the Study roof to get a 
      better view of the performance.
    - BACKGROUND: The Meadow flowers seem to tilt toward her 
      narcissistic gravity.
