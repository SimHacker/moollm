    The tornado has completed its cycle. 
    
    In a final, massive atmospheric burp, the vortex has ejected 
    its entire contents over Fountain Square at Lane Neverending E2.
    
    The FMC Motorcoach #898 drops with a heavy *thud* onto its 
    gravel pad at #15. Richard's Victorian Study dematerializes 
    mid-air and snaps back into its slot inside the Bartle 
    Residence at #13. 
    
    Don and Richard, still in their picnic attire (salsa ears and 
    sauce-stained cardigan), are dumped unceremoniously into the 
    basin of the Fountain of Infinite Loops. They land among a 
    preposterous rain of watermelons, tacos, and tamales. 
    
    Despite the mess, they look at each other and the familiar 
    cobblestones of the square. 
    
    "There's no place like home," Don mops salsa from his face.
    "There's no place like home," Richard agrees, adjusting his 
    gold glasses.

    - CAMERA: 360-degree fisheye panoramic view from the center of the 
      Fountain of Infinite Loops. The edges of the frame are warped 
      into a circular horizon.
    - THE FOUNTAIN (Center): The dry stone basin is now overflowing 
      with food: watermelons, tacos, tamales, and chunks of cheddar. 
      DON (rabbit form) and Dr. BARTLE are sitting in the middle of 
      the culinary debris, looking dazed but happy.
    - SOUTH SIDE (Foreground/Bottom): 
      - #13 BARTLE RESIDENCE: The Victorian house is solid, the Study 
        visible through the bay windows (it's back!).
      - #15 HOPKINS LOT: The FMC #898 is parked on its gravel pad, 
        slightly dusty from the trip.
    - NORTH SIDE (Background/Top): The Curiosity Shop and Bakery 
      are visible across the street.
    - THE SKY: The dark tornado funnel is dissipating into the 
      distance, leaving a trail of drifting corn husks.

    360-degree fisheye panoramic shot, circular perspective. 
    View from the center of a dry stone fountain in a cobblestone 
    market square. 
    
    THE FOUNTAIN (Center):
    - The fountain basin is filled with a mess of food: whole 
      watermelons, scattered tacos, and hundreds of tamales in 
      corn husks.
    - An elderly man with silver hair and a navy blue cardigan 
      (Richard) and a man with rabbit ears and a red Hawaiian 
      shirt (Don) are sitting in the fountain basin, surrounded 
      by the food. They look disheveled but relieved.
    
    THE SQUARE (360 View):
    - To the SOUTH: A row of buildings including a Victorian 
      terraced house (#13) and a gravel lot with a white 1970s 
      motorcoach (#15).
    - To the NORTH: Across the cobblestone street, old shops 
      and a bakery.
    - The architecture is warped by the fisheye lens into a 
      circular frame.
    
    THE SKY:
    - A massive, dissipating tornado funnel is visible in the 
      upper part of the sky, whisking away into the distance. 
      The sky is clearing to a late afternoon gold.
    
    STYLE: Ultra-wide angle panoramic, sharp detail, saturated 
    colors. High-contrast between the messy fountain and the 
    orderly buildings. 18:00 timestamp.
