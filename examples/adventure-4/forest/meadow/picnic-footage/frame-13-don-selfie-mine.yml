    don: |
      The grey-white ears are very prominent, with a soft, fuzzy 
      texture. The 'Salsa Ear' (left) has a distinct, dark red 
      tip that looks like a permanent dye job. The red Hawaiian 
      shirt has a white floral pattern.
    expression: |
      A squinty-eyed, wide-mouthed grin. A few crumbs of masa are 
      visible on his lip.

  - layer: food_macro
    tamale: |
      The corn husk is a warm, toasted yellow. The tamale inside is 
      rich and textured, with a visible line of red sauce. 
      White steam is rising directly into the camera lens.

  - layer: photography_aesthetic
    detail: |
      Classic 'selfie' distortion: the nose and tamale are slightly 
      enlarged. The sunlight is harsh but warm, creating a high-contrast 
      look with deep shadows under the rabbit ears.
    visual_evidence: "Slight glare on Don's glasses from the sun."

narrative_consequences:
  - "The 'Salsa Ear' is visually confirmed as a deep, saturated red."
  - "Don's 'Tomato-Red Hibiscus' shirt has been refined to 'Red with White Florals'."
  - "Smartphone distortion is now a canon visual layer for selfies."
