    Donna Toadstool doesn't just eat the food; she dominates it. 
    Her selfie features her holding a large, jagged block of 
    sharp orange cheddar—the last remnant of the 3-foot pyramid. 
    
    She's wearing a pair of pink heart-shaped glasses ( OURS Accord 
    style) and her glowing green hair is looking particularly 
    electrified. In the background, the 'Trash Can' decoy is 
    visible, still wobbly and smoking.
