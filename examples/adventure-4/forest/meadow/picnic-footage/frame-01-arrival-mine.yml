fordite_layers:

  - layer: natural_immersion
    detail: |
      The vehicles are almost half-submerged in the tall, vibrant 
      green grass. The poppies are a primary-red punctuation against 
      the emerald. The forest wall is deep and shadowy, making the 
      meadow feel like a safe, sun-drenched clearing.
    visual_evidence: "Grass blades are taller than the FMC's lower trim."

  - layer: vehicular_geometry
    study: |
      The Study's mahogany roof is flat and solid, providing a perfect 
      deck. The books inside are visible through the shimmering 
      transparency of the side walls.
    fmc: |
      The FMC's roof is bright white and features a prominent, 
      streamlined domestic A/C unit. The blue and gold stripes wrap 
      cleanly around the aerodynamic nose.
    shadows: "The Study casts a sharp, rectangular shadow; the FMC's 
      shadow is longer and more organic as it breaks across the uneven grass."

  - layer: atmospheric_clarity
    detail: |
      The sky is an intense, saturated azure. The clouds are high-contrast 
      white, with soft, billowy edges that suggest a gentle breeze.
    emergent_detail: "Faint lens flare from the morning sun adds a cinematic 'first morning' feel."

narrative_consequences:
  - "The Study's roof is now a canonical observation deck."
  - "The 'Meadow-Submerged' look emphasizes that they aren't on a road anymore."
  - "The intensity of the blue sky implies a high-altitude or low-pollution namespace."
