    The feast has reached a point of comfortable satiety. Donna, 
    wiping cheddar from her heart-shaped glasses, looks at the 
    FMC Motorcoach. 
    
    "This is a TREMENDOUS vehicle," she says, her voice already 
    starting to shift into the familiar bombastic cadence. "But it 
    needs a bit more... presence."
    
    She winks at Don and Richard, then disappears into the passenger 
    door of the FMC. Within moments, the 'Carrot Cooler' starts 
    vibrating, and a purple glow intensifies in the cockpit. 
    
    Richard and Don share a look. They know what's coming.
