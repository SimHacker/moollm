  A lavish picnic in a sun-drenched meadow surrounded by forest. A tie-dye blanket and small mahogany tables are covered with food: a pyramid of orange cheese, trays of tacos, glazed hams, and spaghetti with meatballs. An elderly man with silver hair and a navy blue cardigan is setting a table. A man with rabbit ears and a red Hawaiian shirt is kneeling on the blanket. A small amber dragon sits in the tall grass. Poppies and daisies bloom around them. In the background, a Victorian mahogany room and a white motorcoach are parked. Saturated colors, high detail.
