  - layer: biological_geometry
    pie_menu_flora: |
      The blue flowers feature eight distinct petals arranged in a 
      perfect circle. Each petal has a slight indentation at the tip, 
      mimicking the visual feedback of a selected pie menu slice. 
      The center of the flower is a bright yellow 'cursor' dot.
    visual_evidence: "Radial symmetry matching DH's UI patents."

  - layer: draconic_texture
    snout_detail: |
      The amber scales are not uniform; they have a micro-texture 
      resembling hammered copper. The dragon's breath has created 
      a faint, shimmering heat-distortion ripple around the blue 
      flowers.
    note: "The dragon's 'Gourmet' interest extends to the local flora."

  - layer: gastronomic_macro
    cheddar_sheen: |
      The block of cheddar has a 'sweating' texture, with minute 
      beads of moisture/oil reflecting the sky. The blue butterfly's 
      legs are delicately gripping the edge of a block.
    butterfly_wings: |
      The neon-blue wings have an iridescent quality, shifting 
      toward purple at the edges, echoing the 'Swirl of Infinite 
      Parameters' blanket below.

  - layer: background_parameters
    blanket_swirl: |
      The tie-dye pattern is high-frequency and chaotic. The colors 
      (Nuclear Magenta, Deep Sea Teal) provide a 'noisy' backdrop 
      that makes the sharp focus of the flora and fauna pop.

narrative_consequences:
  - "Pie-menu flowers provide actual UI-metaphorical feedback to the environment."
  - "Heuristic's scales are now confirmed as 'Hammered Copper Amber'."
  - "The butterfly is a 'Parameter Monarch,' reacting to the blanket's influence."
