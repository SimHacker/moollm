    The ACME truck screeches to a halt, the sudden stop causing its 
    rear doors to burst open. A literal avalanche of cardboard boxes 
    spills onto the grass and flowers. 
    
    The boxes are labeled with 'ACME' in various states of disrepair. 
    One large crate labeled 'ACME DEHYDRATED FEAST - JUST ADD DEW' 
    has split open upon impact with the moist grass. It is already 
    beginning to expand uncontrollably into a pile of oversized, 
    unidentifiable protein cubes.
    
    Another box has partially inflated into an 'ACME INFLATABLE DECOY' 
    of Donna Toadstool herself, her hand raised in a taunting 
    wave, a recorded laugh box echoing through the meadow.
    
    A tiny 'ACME POCKET BLACK HOLE' has rolled near the cheddar 
    pyramid and is starting to pull the 'Nuclear Saffron' blocks 
    toward it.

    - THE TRUCK: Rear doors open, tilted at an angle in the mud and grass. 
      Red paint peeling, 'ACME' logo prominent.
    - THE SPILL:
      - 'DEHYDRATED FEAST': Expanding rapidly into a mountain of 
        gray and beige cubes.
      - 'INFLATABLE DONNA': A half-inflated, wobbly vinyl figure 
        of Donna Toadstool, grinning maliciously.
      - 'MYSTERY BOXES': Several small boxes with large '?' marks, 
        one already vibrating and emitting green smoke.
      - 'POCKET BLACK HOLE': A tiny, perfectly black sphere on the 
        grass, distorting the blades around it.
    - THE REACTION:
      - DON: Desperately grabbing the cheddar blocks before they 
        vanish into the black hole.
      - RICHARD: Standing behind his table, looking at the 'Dehydrated 
        Feast' pile with pure academic horror.
      - HEURISTIC: Snapping his jaws at the Donna decoy.
    - BACKGROUND: The oak tree with the 'Painted Tunnel' is still 
      visible, though the tunnel is fading back to low-res bark.
