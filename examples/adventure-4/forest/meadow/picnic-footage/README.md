# The Great Picnic
## ORB1 Footage — 2026-01-23

> *"The factory must grow, but the picnic must happen."*

## The Event

The pioneers have driven far from the industrial noise of Lane Neverending.
Setting their location to a newly discovered namespace, they have
materialized in **The Forest Meadow**.

This is a place of radical hospitality: tall grass, wildflowers,
massive fluffy clouds, and perfect picnic weather.
