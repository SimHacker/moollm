fordite_layers:

  - layer: the_acme_intruder
    detail: |
      The truck is a '73 ACME Van-Guard. The red paint is peeling in 
      strips, revealing a layer of rusted iron beneath. The ACME logo 
      on the side is faded and slightly off-center.
    visual_evidence: "Peeling red paint and black exhaust soot on the rear panel."

  - layer: character_reaction
    richard: |
      His expression is one of 'Academic Disappointment.' He is 
      looking at the truck not with fear, but as if it were a 
      particularly egregious typo in a doctoral thesis.
    don: |
      His mid-air jump is captured with perfect clarity. The 
      grey-white ears are splayed outward, emphasizing his surprise.
    heuristic: |
      The dragon's warning flame is a bright blue-white spark at 
       the tip of its snout. It has one claw firmly planted on 
      the tie-dye blanket.

  - layer: environmental_glitch
    detail: |
      The 'Painted Tunnel' on the oak tree shows a low-resolution 
      rendering of a desert road, creating a jarring visual rift 
      in the high-detail forest meadow. 
    note: "The tunnel's 2D perspective doesn't match the 3D sunlight 
      of the meadow, making it look like a physical error in reality."

  - layer: motion_dynamics
    detail: |
      The truck's tires are flinging dirt and petals into the air. 
      The grass is being churned into a messy trail of green and 
      brown behind the vehicle.

narrative_consequences:
  - "The 'Painted Tunnel' can now manifest on organic surfaces."
  - "Heuristic is capable of 'Blue-Spark' ignition when provoked."
  - "The ACME truck is a source of 'Resolution Pollution' in the meadow."
