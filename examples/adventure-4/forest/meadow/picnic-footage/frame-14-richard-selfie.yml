    Dr. Bartle, usually the epitome of academic poise, takes his 
    selfie. He's managed to capture himself in mid-slurp, a 
    single long strand of spaghetti bridging the gap between the 
    plate and his mouth.
    
    His gold glasses are crooked, and the large red sauce stain 
    on his navy cardigan sleeve is front and center. He looks 
    startlingly happy.
