    The assembly line has produced enough. The drama has settled. 
    Now comes the main event. 
    
    Don, Richard, and Donna have abandoned all pretense of 
    professional decorum. They are seated around the tie-dye 
    blanket, surrounded by piles of food. 
    
    Don is double-fisting tamales, corn husks flying. Richard has 
    a plate of spaghetti balanced on one knee and a taco flower in 
    his hand, his gold glasses sliding down his nose. Donna is 
    using a block of cheddar as a dipping tool for her meatballs. 
    
    They are eating with a preposterous, cartoonish intensity. 
    "Vorciferously and vermiciously!" as the saying goes.
    
    Heuristic is tucked between Don and Richard, happily munching 
    on a meatball that seems to have 'accidentally' rolled his way.

    - THE SETTING: The sun-drenched meadow. The Fabergé TARDIS 
      and the FMC Motorcoach stand in the background.
    - THE CHARACTERS:
      - DON HOPKINS: Rabbit ears pinned back in concentration, 
        Hawaiian shirt stained with red sauce, mouth full of tamale.
      - Dr. RICHARD BARTLE: Scholarly but ravenous. Napkin tucked into 
        cardigan is now covered in sauce splatters. Holding a 
        bright blue pie-menu flower in one hand, a tamale in the other.
      - DONNA TOADSTOOL: Punk-queen posture, leaning over a pile 
        of cheddar and hams, glowing green hair looking wild.
      - HEURISTIC: Curled in the middle of the group, small 
        flame-puffs of satisfaction rising from his nose.
    - THE FOOD:
      - A chaotic spread of tamales (corn husks everywhere), 
        taco flowers, watermelon slices, and spaghetti.
      - The 3-foot cheddar pyramid is now a 1-foot cheddar crater.

    THE PIONEERS (Eating voraciously):
    - A man with large fuzzy rabbit ears and a loud red Hawaiian shirt (Don) 
      is eating tamales with both hands, corn husks scattered around him.
    - An elderly man with silver hair and a navy cardigan (Richard) is 
      eating a plate of spaghetti and meatballs with comical intensity, 
      a napkin tucked into his collar stained with sauce.
    - A woman with glowing green hair and a black leather jacket (Donna) 
      is sitting on the grass, eating large chunks of cheddar cheese and ham.
    
    THE ENVIRONMENT:
    - They are sitting on a vibrant tie-dye blanket in tall grass filled 
      with red poppies and blue radial flowers.
    - A small amber dragon is in the middle of the group, eating a meatball.
    - In the background, a white motorcoach and a large golden Fabergé 
      egg-structure are parked.
    - Saturated colors, bright sunlight, piles of food including 
      watermelons and taco-shaped flowers.
    
    STYLE: Cinematic action-comedy photography. High detail on the 
    food and messy expressions. A sense of "vermicious" and "vorciferous" 
    hunger. 14:30 timestamp.
