  A chaotic and joyful picnic in a forest meadow. Three people are sitting on a tie-dye blanket, eating voraciously. An elderly man with silver hair and a navy cardigan is eating spaghetti. A man with rabbit ears and a red Hawaiian shirt is eating tamales. A woman with glowing green hair and a black leather jacket is eating cheese and ham. A small amber dragon sits in the middle eating a meatball. Piles of food, bright sunlight, blue sky, high detail.
