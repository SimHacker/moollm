  High-angle cinematic shot of a forest meadow. Golden robotic arms are plucking steaming tamales from brass conveyor belts that fold out of a large 12-foot Fabergé Egg. The robots are placing the tamales onto plates with rice, beans, and melted cheese. An elderly man in a navy cardigan and a man with rabbit ears are watching. A woman with green hair is near the machines. Bright sun, blue sky, steam rising, high detail.
