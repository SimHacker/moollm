    The duel is over. Donna, still breathing hard from the brawl, 
    reaches into her leather jacket and pulls out the green-and-gold 
    Fabergé Egg. 
    
    She pulls a small, ornate brass key from a chain around her neck 
    and inserts it into a hidden keyhole at the top of the egg.
    
    With a sound like a harmonic chord played on a pipe organ, the 
    egg begins to swell. It doesn't just grow; it *unfolds*. The 
    filigree expands, the green enamel stretches, and within 
    seconds, it is the size of a small building—larger even than 
    Richard's Study. 
    
    The front of the egg-structure opens like a set of palace gates, 
    revealing a portal of shimmering violet light.

    - DONNA: Standing before the massive Egg, hand still on the key. 
      Her glowing green hair is wind-swept. She looks triumphant.
    - THE EGG: Now 12 feet tall, a magnificent Faberge-style 
      structure of green enamel and gold filigree. It's glowing 
      from within. The 'doors' are open.
    - THE PIONEERS:
      - DON: Standing near the FMC, mouth agape, ears twitching.
      - RICHARD: Looking through his magnifying glass at the 
        expanding gold patterns.
    - HEURISTIC: Looking up at the TARDIS-egg with sudden respect.
    - THE MEADOW: The grass is bowing away from the egg's 
      gravitational presence.
