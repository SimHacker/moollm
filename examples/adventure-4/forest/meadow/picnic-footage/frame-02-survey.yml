    They have emerged from their respective sanctuaries and climbed 
    to the highest points.
    
    Dr. Richard Bartle stands on the flat mahogany roof of his Study, 
    shielding his eyes from the bright sun. Don Hopkins stands on 
    the white fiberglass roof of his FMC #898, perched near the 
    streamlined A/C unit. 
    
    From this height, they can see the full extent of the meadow, 
    the butterflies dancing above the poppies, and the deep, 
    mysterious forest surrounding them. The sky is vast and perfect.
