    skin: |
      The orange is even more vibrant in the meadow sun. The white 
      circles around the eyes (the 'reverse raccoon') are sharp, 
      suggesting a very high-contrast makeup choice. 
    hair: |
      The straw-yellow combover is a structural marvel. It appears to 
      be defying a 15mph meadow breeze, remaining perfectly rigid.
    suit: |
      The navy blue fabric is stretched tight over the midsection, 
      with visible tension lines radiating from the single closed 
      button. The red tie is a glossy, aggressive silk that nearly 
      touches the grass.

    donna: |
      She is standing on the FMC's retractable step, which is 
      vibrating slightly under her 'tremendous' presence. Her 'OK' 
      gesture is captured in mid-air.
    richard: |
      Partially visible in the lower right, holding a small handheld 
      magnifying glass up to his eye, peering at the hair-structure.
    don: |
      Visible in the lower left, paws mid-clap. His grey rabbit ears 
      are tilted at a 'Fan Club' angle.

  - layer: environmental_bending
    detail: |
      The wildflowers (poppies and pie-menu clusters) in the immediate 
      vicinity of the FMC step appear to be tilting toward Donna, 
      confirming the 'Narcissistic Gravity' effect mentioned in her 
      CHARACTER.yml.
    visual_evidence: "Stem curvature leaning toward the orange skin."

narrative_consequences:
  - "Donna's 'Narcissistic Gravity' is now a physically observable phenomenon."
  - "The 'Reverse Raccoon' eye makeup is definitive for this persona."
  - "The FMC has effectively served as a mobile 'Transmogrification Chamber'."
