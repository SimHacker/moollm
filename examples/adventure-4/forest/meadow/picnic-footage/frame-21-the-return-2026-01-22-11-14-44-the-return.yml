  360-degree fisheye panoramic view from the center of a dry fountain in a cobblestone square. The fountain is filled with food: watermelons, tacos, and tamales. Two men, one with silver hair and one with rabbit ears, sit in the fountain surrounded by the food. In the background, a Victorian house and a white motorcoach are visible on their lots. A dissipating tornado is in the sky. Saturated colors, high detail, circular frame.
