fordite_layers:

  - layer: vortex_dynamics
    detail: |
      The tornado is a dark, swirling mass of grey and deep violet. 
      It is perfectly centered in the meadow, creating a vacuum that 
      has turned the bright flowery floor into a churned brown circle.
    visual_evidence: "Centrifugal ring of dirt and petals around the funnel base."

  - layer: vehicular_levitation
    study: |
      The Victorian Study is tilted at a 45-degree angle, hovering 
      about 10 feet off the ground. The mahogany roof is catching 
      the sun, while the books inside are being pressed against 
       the windows by g-forces.
    fmc: |
      The FMC Motorcoach is fully airborne, its wheels still 
      spinning. The white fiberglass body is gleaming, making it 
      look like a massive white projectile in the dark storm.

  - layer: character_trajectories
    richard: |
      Floating horizontally, his navy cardigan billowing. He is 
      looking down at the Study with an expression of deep 
      architectural concern.
    don: |
      His grey-white rabbit ears are being pulled upward by the 
      vortex, making them look even longer. He's reaching out toward 
      a floating watermelon.
    donna: |
      Her straw-yellow hair is being whipped into a chaotic cloud, 
      losing its architectural structure. The orange skin is a 
      bright, high-contrast dot in the middle of the debris.
    heuristic: |
      A golden-amber streak of scales near the top of the funnel. 
      He looks surprisingly aerodynamic.

  - layer: gastronomic_shrapnel
    detail: |
      Watermelons and tamales are rotating in distinct 'flavor rings'. 
      A large ham is visible near the FMC's door. The cheddar 
      blocks are flying like orange shrapnel.

narrative_consequences:
  - "The Forest Meadow has been partially un-rendered by the vacuum."
  - "The pioneers are now in 'Skybound Transclusion' mode."
  - "Richard's Study is effectively a mobile-home-in-a-tornado."
