    The FMC #898 has become the "Infamous Bus." 
    
    Donna Toadstool is prancing down the retractable steps, 
    her radioactive orange skin glowing with narcissistic fervor. 
    She reaches down and aggressively plucks a large yellow 'Taco Flower' 
    from the grass.
    
    "You just grab 'em by the taco," she bellows to an unseen 
    audience, her voice crackling like a hot mic. "They let you 
    do that when you're a star! You can do anything!"
    
    Don Hopkins is leaning against the FMC's doorframe, his 
    rabbit ears pinned back in a mix of amusement and "I can't 
    believe she said that." Dr. Bartle is standing by the Study, 
    shaking his head with the weary patience of a man who has 
    seen every player type, but none quite like this.

    - DONNA: Full drag king regalia. She is mid-prance, holding 
      a yellow Taco Flower aloft. Her expression is one of 
      extreme entitlement and bombastic joy.
    - THE FMC #898: Serving as the "Access Hollywood" bus. 
      The blue and gold stripes catch the sun. The door is open.
    - THE PIONEERS:
      - DON: Leaning on the bus, looking at the camera with 
        a "get a load of this" smirk.
      - RICHARD: Background, by the Study door, looking at his 
        watch (the large gold one Donna noted earlier).
    - THE MEADOW: Taco Flowers are plentiful around the bus steps.
    - CAMERA STYLE: Slightly shaky, lower angle than the previous 
      Orb shots, mimicking a grainy leaked video.

    Cinematic medium shot, low angle. A woman in full bombastic 
    drag king impersonation (Donna Toadstool) is prancing out of 
    a white 1970s motorcoach in a flowery meadow. 
    
    DONNA (SATIRICAL DETAIL):
    - Skin: Intense RADIOACTIVE ORANGE, clearly fake. 
    - Hair: Massive STRAW-YELLOW COMBOVER swoop.
    - Pose: One hand is aggressively plucking a yellow-gold 'Taco Flower' 
      from the tall grass. The other hand is gesturing BIGLY.
    - Expression: Arrogant, wide-mouthed grin of a reality TV star.
    
    ACTION:
    - She is stepping off the retractable stairs of the FMC Motorcoach.
    - A man with large grey rabbit ears (Don) is leaning against 
      the coach's door, smirking at the viewer.
    - In the background, an elderly man with silver hair (Richard) 
      stands by a Victorian Study, looking weary.
    
    STYLE: Leaked "hot-mic" video aesthetic — slight motion blur, 
    vibrant but slightly grainy colors, high contrast. 
    The white motorcoach dominates the background like a 
    celebrity tour bus. 15:45 timestamp.
