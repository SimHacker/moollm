    The FMC #898 has become the "Infamous Bus." 
    
    Donna Toadstool is prancing down the retractable steps in full 
    drag king regalia. Her radioactive orange skin glows with 
    narcissistic fervor. She reaches down and aggressively grabs a 
    large, steaming yellow 'Taco Flower' from the grass.
    
    "You just grab 'em by the taco," she bellows, her voice 
    crackling like a hot mic. "They let you do that when you're 
    a star! You can do anything!"
    
    Don Hopkins is leaning against the FMC's doorframe, his 
    left ear still stained red with salsa, smirking at the 
    cringe. Dr. Bartle is by the Study, his navy cardigan 
    splattered with red sauce, looking at his watch.
