    detail: |
      The fisheye lens has captured the entire square in a single 
      circular frame. The cobble-stone pattern radiating from the 
      fountain base is perfectly visible. The buildings lean inward 
      toward the pioneers, creating a feeling of containment and safety.
    visual_evidence: "Curved horizon and radial cobblestone patterns."

  - layer: fountain_gastronomy
    detail: |
      The fountain basin is a literal 'food-sink.' Watermelons are 
      stacked 3-high in the lower left. The spaghetti has formed 
      a messy red 'nest' around Richard's loafers. A few stray 
      tacos are perched on the stone statue in the center.
    visual_evidence: "Vibrant red sauce and orange cheese contrasting with the grey stone basin."

    richard: |
      Sitting on the edge of the fountain basin. His navy cardigan 
      is now a multi-colored mosaic of spills and meadow dust. 
      He is holding his gold glasses in one hand, looking 
      at Don with a grin.
    don: |
      Sitting cross-legged in the middle of the tamale pile. 
      His rabbit ears are tangled with a single strand of 
      spaghetti. He is holding a watermelon slice like a peace 
      offering.
    heuristic: |
      Visible in the distance, perched on the Study's window sill 
      inside #13. He beat them home.

  - layer: vehicular_re-docking
    study: |
      The Study is perfectly framed in the #13 bay window. 
      The warm amber light inside is already on, signaling a 
      return to the 'State Preservation' mode.
    fmc: |
      The FMC #898 is perfectly aligned on its gravel pad at #15. 
      The blue and gold stripes are dusty, but the vehicle looks 
      undamaged.

narrative_consequences:
  - "The Fountain of Infinite Loops is no longer dry; it is filled 
    with high-calorie transclusion artifacts."
  - "Heuristic is canonically faster than a tornado."
  - "The 'There's no place like home' realization has been visually 
    and spatially validated."
