  - layer: academic_disarray
    richard: |
      His silver hair is windswept and chaotic. The gold-rimmed 
      glasses are tilted at a 15-degree angle. He looks like 
      he's just discovered a new player type: 'The Ravenous Slurper.'
    the_stain: |
      The red sauce stain on the navy cable-knit wool is detailed, 
      with a darker center where the sauce is thickest. It's a 
      bold splash of color against the dark blue.

  - layer: spaghetti_physics
    detail: |
      The spaghetti strand is taut, suggesting a high-velocity 
      slurp. The meatballs on the plate are large and irregularly 
      shaped, with visible herbs.
    visual_evidence: "Single strand perfectly captured in mid-motion."

  - layer: background_context
    detail: |
      The background shows the rich, dark mahogany of the Study walls. 
      A few gold-lettered book spines are visible in the bokeh blur, 
      reminding us that this is a place of learning, even during 
      a food frenzy.

narrative_consequences:
  - "The 'Ravenous Slurper' is now an unofficial fifth player type."
  - "Richard's navy cardigan is now 'Distressed-Industrial' style."
  - "Scholarly joy is confirmed to be messy."
