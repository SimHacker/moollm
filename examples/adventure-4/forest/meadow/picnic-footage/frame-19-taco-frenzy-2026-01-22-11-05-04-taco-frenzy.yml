  Extreme macro close-up of a woman with tangerine-colored skin and a massive, shellacked swoop of yellow hair ravenously eating yellow-gold flowers shaped like tacos. She is mid-chomp, her mouth full of red and green flower parts. Bright neon orange pollen is smeared on her upper lip. She is holding several taco-shaped blooms in her hands. Saturated colors, bright sunlight, high detail, messy and joyful.
