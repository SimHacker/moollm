    The golden afternoon is over. A dark, funnel-shaped cloud has 
    dropped from the fluffy wool sky, rotating with a low-frequency 
    ROAR. 
    
    It's a logistical vacuum cleaner. It's slurping up the 
    'Swirl of Infinite Parameters' blanket, the mahogany tables, 
    the silver trays of tacos, the hams, the spaghetti, and every 
    last block of cheddar. 
    
    But it doesn't stop at the food. 
    
    The Victorian Study is tilted on its side, books spilling into 
    the vortex. The FMC Motorcoach is being lifted off its wheels, 
    spinning like a giant white-and-blue top. 
    
    Don, Richard, and Donna are caught in the spiral, floating among 
    taco flowers and watermelons, whisked into the azure sky 
    like Dorothy in a Kansas twister. Heuristic is a golden 
    streak in the middle of it all, looking more confused than 
    defensive.

    - THE TORNADO: A massive, grey-violet funnel cloud dominating 
      the center of the meadow. Debris is rotating in a violent 
      spiral.
    - THE SLURP:
      - FOOD: Watermelons, tacos, tamales, and hams are flying 
        upward in a centrifugal trail.
      - TECH: Brass conveyor belts and golden inserter arms are 
        being torn from the ground and sucked into the vortex.
      - VEHICLES: The mahogany Study and white FMC are airborne, 
        spinning within the funnel.
    - THE PIONEERS:
      - DON: Mid-air, red hibiscus shirt flapping, ears swept up.
      - RICHARD: Still holding his tea cup (which is now empty) as 
        he floats upward.
      - DONNA: Full drag regalia (orange skin, yellow hair) 
        screaming as she spirals.
    - HEURISTIC: A golden dragon silhouette caught in the updraft.
    - THE MEADOW: Grass is being ripped out; the forest wall is 
      bending inward toward the vacuum.

    High-angle cinematic disaster shot. A massive tornado is 
    slurping up a lavish picnic in a forest meadow.
    
    THE VORTEX:
    - A dark, spinning funnel cloud is in the center of the meadow.
    - A swirl of debris is rotating around the funnel: watermelons, 
      tacos, hams, spaghetti, and pieces of golden robot arms.
    - A white motorcoach and a Victorian mahogany room are tilted 
      and being lifted into the air by the wind.
    
    THE PEOPLE (In mid-air):
    - A man with rabbit ears and a red Hawaiian shirt is floating 
      upward.
    - An elderly man with silver hair is being whisked away.
    - A woman with orange skin and a large yellow hair-swoop is 
      spiraling in the air.
    - A small amber dragon is caught in the vortex.
    
    THE ENVIRONMENT:
    - Lush meadow with grass being torn from the ground.
    - Saturated colors, motion blur, dramatic lighting from the 
      stormy funnel vs the bright sky.
    
    STYLE: Epic disaster-movie cinematography, high contrast, 
    dynamic motion. 16:30 timestamp.
