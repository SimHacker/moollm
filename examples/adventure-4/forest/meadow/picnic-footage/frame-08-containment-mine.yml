  - layer: technological_triumph
    pocket_dimension: |
      The purple keychain (Pocket Dimension) is pulsing with a rhythmic 
      light. The black hole is being stretched into a thin, curved 
      strand of darkness as it enters the device.
    self_healing_module: |
      The green light from the module is forming a 'digital bandage' 
      over the tree. The bark being generated is hyper-detailed, making 
      the surrounding low-res tunnel look even more artificial.
    draconic_victory: |
      Heuristic's scales are glowing a satisfying gold. The melted 
      Donna decoy is a charred heap of magenta and black, with a 
      single, cracked plastic crown resting on top.

    richard: |
      His silver hair is backlit by the sun, creating a 'halo' effect. 
      He is leaning back slightly to avoid the gravitational pull 
      of the vanishing black hole.
    don: |
      He is standing with one foot on a protruding root of the oak tree. 
      The grey-white ears are twitching forward, monitoring the 
      regeneration process. The tomato-red shirt is vibrant in the 
      shadow of the forest edge.

  - layer: atmospheric_resolution
    detail: |
      The black smoke from the ACME truck is beginning to dissipate, 
      revealing the pristine azure of the forest sky once more. 
      The 'Resolution Pollution' is literally being scrubbed from 
      the air by the meadow's own organic processes.

narrative_consequences:
  - "The 'Gilded Threshold' is now safe again."
  - "Heuristic has proven effective against 'unauthorized inflatables'."
  - "Richard and Don've demonstrated that Leela tech is the definitive 
    patch for ACME glitches."
