    The displacement of air is soft — a collective WHOMP that 
    flattens the tall grass in two perfect circles.
    
    In the middle of the flowery meadow, the Victorian Study 
    and the FMC #898 appear side-by-side. The transition from 
    industrial lobby to ancient forest is instantaneous and 
    stunning.
    
    The mahogany of the Study absorbs the sunlight, while the 
    FMC's fiberglass shell reflects the emerald green of the grass.

    - THE MEADOW: Bright green grass, poppies, and daisies. 
      Surrounded by a high wall of pines and oaks.
    - THE STUDY: Dark mahogany, parked left. Its windows reflect 
      the forest wall instead of the lobby.
    - THE FMC #898: White with blue/gold stripes, parked right. 
      The hubcaps catch the sun.
    - CHARACTERS: (Still inside or about to emerge)
    - SKY: Brilliant blue, huge fluffy white clouds.

    High-angle wide shot (ORB1 perspective) of a bright, sun-drenched 
    meadow in a forest. Two anomalous vehicles have just materialized 
    in the tall grass, which is flattened around them.
    
    VEHICLE 1: A cozy Victorian mahogany study with floor-to-ceiling 
    bookshelves and transparent outer walls. A burgundy Persian rug 
    is visible inside.
    
    VEHICLE 2: A sleek 30-foot 1970s FMC Motorcoach, white with 
    distinctive blue and gold stripes and reflective chrome hubcaps.
    
    THE ENVIRONMENT:
    - The meadow is filled with red poppies, white daisies, and 
      purple lavender.
    - Towering pine and oak trees surround the meadow.
    - The sky is deep blue with massive, fluffy white clouds like 
      piles of wool.
    - The golden morning sunlight creates long shadows and 
      vibrant highlights.
    
    STYLE: High-detail cinematic nature photography. Sharp focus 
    on the contrast between the artificial vehicles and the 
    lush organic meadow. 11:30 timestamp.
