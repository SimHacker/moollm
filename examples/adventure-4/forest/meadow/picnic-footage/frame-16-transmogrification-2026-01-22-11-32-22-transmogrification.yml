  High-angle wide shot of a messy picnic aftermath in a forest meadow. An elderly man with silver hair and a man with rabbit ears are sitting on a tie-dye blanket covered in food scraps. They are looking toward a white 1970s motorcoach. A bright purple light is glowing from the windows of the motorcoach, and its door is slightly ajar. A Victorian room and a large golden egg are in the background. Warm afternoon sunlight, long shadows, high detail.
