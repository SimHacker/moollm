    donna: |
      The 'Tangerine' skin has a semi-matte, foundation-thick texture. 
      The yellow hair-swoop is a single, unified piece of keratin 
      architecture. She is holding the yellow 'Taco Flower' near her 
      face, her expression one of bombastic entitlement.
    the_tie: |
      The red tie is extremely long, disappearing below the bottom 
      of the frame, emphasizing the 'compensation' aspect of the 
      costume.

    don: |
      His grey-white ears are tilted back. The 'Salsa Ear' (left) 
      shows a dark, dried-red stain at the tip. He is leaning against 
      the white fiberglass of the coach, looking at the camera.
    richard: |
      He is sitting in his mahogany armchair, which has been moved 
      onto the grass. His navy cardigan shows the bold red spaghetti 
      stain on his right side.

  - layer: floral_physics
    detail: |
      The yellow 'Taco Flower' in Donna's hand is being gripped 
      forcefully. Its shell-shaped petals are slightly bent, showing 
      a 'toasted' texture. 
    note: "She is treating the flora as a prop for her performance."

  - layer: vehicular_presence
    fmc_detail: |
      The white shell of the FMC #898 reflects the green meadow 
      and the red of the poppies. The blue stripes provide a 
      cool linear contrast to the chaotic meadow.

narrative_consequences:
  - "Donna's 'Tangerine & Straw' palette is confirmed as her high-drag look."
  - "Richard has officially moved his 'Study Furniture' into the meadow."
  - "The 'Salsa Ear' and 'Cardigan Stain' are stable visual tokens of the feast."
