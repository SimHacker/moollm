  A magnificent 12-foot tall Fabergé Egg made of gold filigree and green enamel has opened like a set of palace doors in a sun-drenched flowery meadow. A shimmering violet light glows from inside. A woman with glowing green hair and black leather stands in front of it. An elderly man and a man with rabbit ears watch in amazement. A small amber dragon sits nearby. In the background, a Victorian study and a white motorcoach are parked. Epic fantasy cinematic photography, high detail.
