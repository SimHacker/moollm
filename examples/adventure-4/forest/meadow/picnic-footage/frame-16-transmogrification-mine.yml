    detail: |
      The purple light emanating from the FMC's windows is an intense, 
      ultraviolet-violet hue. It spills through the gaps in the door 
      and creates a vibrant magenta aura on the surrounding tall grass.
    visual_evidence: "Magenta-tinted grass near the coach door."

      He is leaning forward, his navy blue cardigan catching the 
      purple spill. He looks fascinated, his hand adjusting his 
      glasses as he peers toward the flickering interior.
    don: |
      He is sitting cross-legged, his rabbit ears angled toward 
      the coach. He looks knowing, a slight smirk on his face 
      as he holds a half-eaten watermelon slice.

  - layer: picnic_entropy
    detail: |
      The 'Swirl of Infinite Parameters' blanket is now a disaster 
      zone. Scattered corn husks from the tamales look like pale 
      yellow shrapnel. A single silver tray is tilted, reflecting 
      both the yellow sun and the purple bus-glow.
    note: "The mess anchors the scene in the aftermath of the voracious feast."

  - layer: background_silence
    detail: |
      The Study and the Fabergé TARDIS look monolithic and quiet 
      in the background, their golden light fading as the purple 
      intensity takes over the composition.

narrative_consequences:
  - "The 'Purple Pulse' is the visual signal for Donna's drag-loading phase."
  - "Richard and Don's shared look confirms their partnership in the performance."
  - "The meadow's natural peace is being overwritten by 'Star Energy'."
