  High-angle wide shot of a bright sun-drenched meadow in a forest. A Victorian mahogany study with book-filled shelves and a white 1970s motorcoach with blue/gold stripes are parked side-by-side in the tall grass. The meadow is filled with poppies and daisies. The sky is deep blue with massive fluffy white clouds. Golden morning sunlight, cinematic nature photography, high detail.
