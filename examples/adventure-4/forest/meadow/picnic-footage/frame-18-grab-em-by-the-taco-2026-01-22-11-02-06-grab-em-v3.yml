  A woman with tangerine-colored skin and a large, shellacked swoop of yellow hair is stepping off a white motorcoach in a meadow. She wears a navy suit and a long red tie. She holds a yellow flower shaped like a taco. A man with rabbit ears and an elderly man in a stained blue sweater watch from the side. Saturated colors, sunny day, sharp focus.
