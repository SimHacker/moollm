fordite_layers:

  - layer: logistical_surrealism
    conveyor_belts: |
      The belts are made of polished brass slats, catching the 
      sunlight and reflecting the green of the grass. They appear 
      to be 'unfolding' in a fractal pattern from the Egg's base.
    tamale_texture: |
      The corn husks are highly detailed, showing the individual 
      fibers and the golden-brown char marks from steaming. 
      Vibrant white steam is captured in mid-ascent.
    inserter_arms: |
      The golden robot arms have a 'clockwork-industrial' look, 
      with visible pistons and hydraulic lines. They move with 
      visible motion blur, suggesting high-speed production.

    richard: |
      He is standing so close to one of the belts that his 
      cardigan is almost touching a tamale. His expression is 
      one of deep concentration, as if he's decoding the 
      recipe from the mechanical movement.
    don: |
      His rabbit ears are tilted at a 'joyful frequency.' The 
      red hibiscus shirt is now partially obscured by a 
      large porcelain plate he is holding, already laden with 
      a perfectly assembled meal.
    donna: |
      She is leaning over a control panel that has sprouted from 
      one of the Inserters. Her green hair glows more 
      intensely near the machinery.

  - layer: emergent_gastronomy
    cheese_melt: |
      The orange cheddar is perfectly melted, flowing over the 
      rice and beans in a way that suggests a high-temperature 
      'broiling' phase inside the Inserter's path.
    sauce_detail: |
      The red tamale sauce is being dispensed in a perfect 
      sinusoidal wave pattern across the top of the tamales.

narrative_consequences:
  - "The Fabergé TARDIS is confirmed to have a built-in 'Factorio Kitchen'."
  - "The 'Sinusoidal Sauce' pattern is now canon assembly protocol."
  - "The pioneers have successfully scaled their picnic to industrial levels."
