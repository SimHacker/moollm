    detail: |
      The egg is a marvel of transclusive engineering. The green enamel 
      is semitransparent, revealing complex gears and clockwork 
      rotating behind the surface. The gold filigree is etched with 
      recursive patterns that seem to flow as the structure opens.
    visual_evidence: "Gears visible beneath the green surface; intricate glowing filigree."

      He is leaning forward, his gold-rimmed glasses reflecting the 
      violet portal. He looks less shocked and more like he's 
      calculating the volume of the interior.
    don: |
      His jaw is dropped so low it's almost touching his Hawaiian 
      shirt. The grey ears are pointing in two different directions 
      (maximal sensory intake).
    donna: |
      Her pose is iconic: one hand on her hip, the other holding the 
      brass key aloft. She is the 'Gatekeeper of the OURS Accord.'

  - layer: emergent_interiors
    detail: |
      The violet light from the portal is casting long, magenta 
      shadows across the meadow grass. Inside the portal, one can 
      glimpse the outlines of more treasure—specifically, more 
      Fabergé eggs of different colors.
    note: "The Egg is a gateway to a nested egg-metaverse."

  - layer: atmospheric_distortion
    detail: |
      The heat-distortion from Heuristic's earlier spark has mixed 
      with the cold violet energy of the portal, creating a shimmering 
      aurora-like effect in the air around the egg.

narrative_consequences:
  - "The Fabergé Egg is now a validated TARDIS-class vehicle."
  - "Donna holds the key to the 'Egg-Metaverse'."
  - "The pioneers' convoy now has a third, much smaller (but bigger) member."
