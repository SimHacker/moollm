  - layer: gastronomic_gluttony
    detail: |
      Donna's mouth is stretched wide, capturing the exact moment of 
      mechanical and biological collision. The yellow-gold 'shell' 
      petals are fracturing into jagged pieces, revealing a 
      crystalline, sugary texture inside the 'corn' husk.
    visual_evidence: "Shattered petal fragments on her lower lip."

  - layer: character_disarray
    skin: |
      The 'Tangerine' foundation is cracking around the mouth and 
      jawline, revealing the physical strain of the voracious feast. 
      The 'Reverse Raccoon' eye-circles are glowing with a 
      feverish intensity.
    makeup_collision: |
      The neon-orange pollen has mixed with the tangerine makeup 
      to create a 'Super-Orange' sludge on her upper lip. 
    hair: |
      The sentient combover has a few rogue strands sticking out 
      like radio antennas, as if the hair itself is excited by the 
      caloric intake.

  - layer: floral_anatomy_v2
    detail: |
      The red 'meat' stamens are remarkably juicy, leaving a 
      deep-crimson stain on Donna's white teeth. The green 'lettuce' 
      bases have a waxy, high-gloss finish.
    note: "The flowers aren't just shaped like food; they appear 
      to have high-protein content."

  - layer: macro_lighting
    detail: |
      The sunlight is so direct that it reveals individual beads 
      of sweat breaking through the orange makeup on her forehead. 
      The shadows of the taco-petals create a cage-like pattern 
      on her face.

narrative_consequences:
  - "Donna's 'Pollen Moustache' is now a canon secondary disguise."
  - "Taco Flowers provide a 'Sugary-Crunch' audio-visual experience."
  - "The 'Resolution Pollution' of the ACME intruder is being 
    literally consumed and metabolized by Donna."
