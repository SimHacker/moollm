fordite_layers:

  - layer: ontological_brawl
    real_donna: |
      Her leather jacket has 'ACME QUALITY CONTROL' stenciled on the 
      back in faded white letters. Her glowing green hair is sharp and 
      vibrant, casting a faint neon-green halo on the grass.
    decoy_donna: |
      The 'Trash Can' shape is unmistakable. The swinging door says 
      'PUSH' in a 1970s bubble font. The red tie is made of shiny 
      red satin and is knotted perfectly around its wobbly 'neck'.
    motion: |
      The decoy's base is weighted like a real punching bag, creating 
      a 'BOING' trajectory as it snaps back from Donna's hits.

  - layer: character_amusement
    don: |
      He's holding the cheddar block like a football. His ears are 
      flopped over in a 'This is Ridiculous' configuration.
    richard: |
      He has pulled out a small magnifying glass and is leaning in 
      (from a safe distance) to study the 8-bit artifacts on the 
      decoy's surface.
    heuristic: |
      The dragon is sitting back on his haunches, scratching his neck 
      with a back claw, clearly bored by the non-biological combat.

  - layer: emerging_environment
    detail: |
      The sun is at its zenith, creating very short, high-contrast 
      shadows. A second, smaller ACME truck is visible in the extreme 
      distance, possibly a chase vehicle?
    note: "The 'Resolution Pollution' from the decoy is creating 
      small, pixelated flowers in the grass immediately beneath it."

narrative_consequences:
  - "Donna's role as 'Quality Control' is now visually canon."
  - "Decoy Donna's 'Trash Can' form is a stable glitch."
  - "The presence of pixelated flowers suggests the meadow is being 
    locally terraformed by ACME artifacts."
