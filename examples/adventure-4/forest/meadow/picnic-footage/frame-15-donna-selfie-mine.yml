fordite_layers:

  - layer: quality_control_punk
    donna: |
      Her green hair is practically neon, with a few strands 
      defying gravity. The pink heart glasses are oversized and 
      have a pearlescent finish. Her grin is wide and toothy, 
      exuding 'Quality Control' dominance.
    the_jacket: |
      The black leather is cracked and worn, with a visible 
      'ACME' patch on the collar as prompted. It looks like it has 
      survived many product tests.

  - layer: cheddar_triumph
    detail: |
      The cheddar block is huge, roughly the size of her head. 
      It's a vibrant, unnatural orange ('Nuclear Saffron'). 
      The surface is jagged and crystalline, catching the sunlight 
      in a way that makes it look like a radioactive gemstone.
    visual_evidence: "Single massive block held with two-handed intensity."

  - layer: background_narrative
    detail: |
      The meadow poppies in the background are a soft, blurred 
      crimson. A thin, dark vertical line in the distance might 
      be the smoke trail from the battered ACME truck.

narrative_consequences:
  - "The 'Nuclear Saffron' cheddar is officially Donna's spirit food."
  - "Donna's heart glasses are now a permanent part of her 'Pioneer' ensemble."
  - "Punk-Queen authority is maintained even when double-fisting cheese."
