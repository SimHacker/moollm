    The pioneers have stopped the spread.
    
    Richard Bartle, still holding his tea with one hand, uses the 
    'Pocket Dimension Container' (amethyst glow) to scoop up the 
    tiny 'Pocket Black Hole'. The black hole is sucked into the 
    keychain with a pop, releasing its grip on the cheddar.
    
    Don Hopkins has slapped a 'Self-Healing Module' (green circuit 
    glow) onto the oak tree's trunk. The 'Painted Tunnel' is being 
    literally overwritten by high-res bark textures.
    
    Heuristic has reduced the Inflatable Donna decoy to a pile of 
    molten vinyl with a single, precise blue-spark blast. 
    
    The ACME truck sits silent and smoking, its cargo now inert.

      amethyst keychain (Pocket Dimension) toward the black hole.
    - DON: Standing by the oak tree, hand on a sleek green module 
      that is emitting 'healing' light onto the bark.
    - HEURISTIC: Standing triumphantly over a deflated, smoking heap 
      of pink and black vinyl.

    - BACKGROUND: The Study and FMC #898 stand ready, their golden 
      interiors promising a return to the picnic.
