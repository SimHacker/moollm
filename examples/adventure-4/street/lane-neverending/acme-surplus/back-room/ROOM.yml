    The back room is cold. Dark. Full of boxes that were never shipped,
    returns that were never processed, prototypes that were never finished.
    
    And something is ticking.
    
    *tick tick tick*
    
    It's coming from somewhere in the stacks. Rhythmic. Patient.
    It has been ticking for a long time.
    It will keep ticking until it doesn't.
    
  atmosphere: |
    Dust. Darkness. The smell of old cardboard and unfinished business.
    Shelves stretch into shadow. Boxes are stacked to the ceiling.
    Labels have faded. Contents have shifted.
    
    The ticking is louder in here.
    
  # TRAP DEPLOYMENT GUIDANCE — For the DM/LLM
  #
  # This room should feel like the EXPERIMENTAL and MYSTERY sections of the
  # ACME catalog came to life. Deploy traps that are:
  # - Mysterious (unknown effects)
  # - Time-based (the ticking is SOMEWHERE)
  # - Ironic to the player's actions
  #
  # See: w1/acme-catalog.yml → mystery_items, tools
  
  trap_themes:
    primary: [mystery, experimental, time, unknown]
    secondary: [storage, forgotten, prototype]
    mood: "ominous patience"
    
    # What kinds of traps fit here?
    catalog_sections:
      - mystery_items     # Mystery boxes, do-it-yourself kits, plot devices
      - tools             # Universal remotes, time stoppers, gravity reversers
      - detection_devices # Detectors that detect the WRONG thing
      
    # Ironic trigger patterns for this room
    irony_patterns:
      - "Player searches boxes → finds something they weren't looking for"
      - "Player follows the ticking → ticking stops (worse)"
      - "Player opens a 'DO NOT OPEN' box → as advertised"
      - "Player tries to leave quietly → something notices"
      
    # Suggested (not exhaustive) deployments
    example_encounters:
      - trigger: "Opening random box"
        suggestion: "ACME Mystery Box — contains something ironic to situation"
      - trigger: "Finding the ticking"
        suggestion: "ACME Time-Delay Dynamite — fuse length 'varies'"
      - trigger: "Reading old labels"
        suggestion: "ACME Invisible Ink Revealer — makes visible things invisible"
        
  # THE TICKING
  the_ticking:
    source: "Unknown (for now)"
    location: "Somewhere in the stacks"
    rhythm: "Exactly once per second. Too precise."
    theories:
      - "ACME Time-Delay Dynamite (fuse length: years?)"
      - "ACME Time Stopper (frozen mid-activation)"
      - "Something worse"

  # THE BOX THAT WORKS
  secrets:
    the_box_that_works:
      location: "Shelf 7, Row 13, behind the returns"
      appearance: "Plain brown box, labeled 'ANOMALY — DO NOT SHIP'"
      contents: "One ACME product that works PERFECTLY"
      horror: |
        It does exactly what it says.
        No malfunction. No irony. No catch.
        This terrifies everyone.
        
        If opened, DM should invent something useful that works perfectly —
        and is therefore deeply unsettling in context.
        
  objects:
    # Sparse — let DM deploy from catalog as needed
    - the-ticking.yml     # Placeholder for the mystery
    - returns-pile.yml    # Defective products — potential trap sources
