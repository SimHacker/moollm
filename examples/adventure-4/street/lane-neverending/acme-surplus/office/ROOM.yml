    The spiral staircase creaks as you climb.
    
    The office is frozen in time — mid-pivot. Whiteboards cover every wall,
    layered with plans that were never executed, strategies that were
    abandoned mid-sentence, roadmaps to nowhere.
    
    A desk sits in the center, covered in papers. The chair is pushed back,
    as if someone left in a hurry and never returned.
    
    The last pivot is still on the board.
    
  atmosphere: |
    Dust on everything. Papers yellowed. Coffee cups fossilized.
    The whiteboards tell a story of escalating desperation:
    
    "PIVOT TO SOCIAL" (crossed out)
    "PIVOT TO MOBILE" (crossed out)
    "PIVOT TO CRYPTO" (crossed out, with angry scribbles)
    "PIVOT TO AI" (underlined, then crossed out)
    "ACME FINAL FORM" (circled, with arrows to nothing)
    
    The last entry: "IT WORKS. THAT'S THE PROBLEM."
    
  # TRAP DEPLOYMENT GUIDANCE — For the DM/LLM
  #
  # This room should feel like CORPORATE HORROR meets ACME ILLUSIONS.
  # The whiteboards themselves might be traps. The plans might activate.
  # Deploy traps that are:
  # - Illusory (things aren't what they seem)
  # - Identity-based (who are you really?)
  # - Psychological (existential dread as damage type)
  #
  # See: w1/acme-catalog.yml → disguises, detection_devices
  
  trap_themes:
    primary: [illusion, identity, psychological, corporate]
    secondary: [planning, pivot, failure, abandonment]
    mood: "existential startup horror"
    
    catalog_sections:
      - disguises        # Invisible paint, costumes, holograms

    irony_patterns:
      - "Player reads the plans → plans read the player"

      - "Player erases whiteboard → whiteboard erases something of theirs"
      - "Player finds the 'final form' → it finds them"
