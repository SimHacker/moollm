    philosophy: |
      ACME never removed their "security" systems.
      The products may not work as intended — but they WORK.
      Just not the way you want them to.
      
    warning: |
      🚨 THIS BUILDING IS SECURED BY ACME PRODUCTS 🚨
      
      All entrances are locked, trapped, or both.
      Breaking in is possible but inadvisable.
      ACME is not responsible for injuries, deaths, anvils,

            *WHOOOOSH*
            
            An anvil swings down from the ceiling on a rope!
            
            ROLL: Dodge or take 2d6 anvil damage.

            *CLANG CLANG CLANG*
            
            A cascade of anvils tumbles from a shelf above the door,
            rolling toward you like metallic bowling balls.
            
            ROLL: Acrobatics or become an anvil pin.

            *CLICK*
            
            Your feet land on something. Straps tighten around your ankles.
            
            You look down: ACME ROCKET SKATES (Model 9).
            
            The fuse ignites.
            
            *FWOOOOOSH*
            
            ROLL: Steering (you don't have this skill) or hit something.
            
            You career through the store at 60mph, bouncing off shelves,
            through a stack of portable holes, and out the back wall.
            
            You land in the alley. Smoking slightly.

            You push open the door—
            
            *BOING*
            
            The floor is a GIANT SPRING.
            
            You launch upward, through a conveniently placed hole in the
            ceiling, through the second floor, through the ROOF—
            
            For a moment, you can see Lane Neverending from above.
            Leela's rooftop garden. The pub's chimney smoke.
            It's beautiful up here.
            
            Then gravity remembers you.
            
            You land back on the spring. Repeat. Repeat. Eventually stop.

            You pry open the grate and crawl inside...
            
            It's dusty. Dark. Something scurries ahead of you.
            
            You make it twenty feet before—
            
            *HISSSS*
            
            A canister ahead ruptures. ACME TUNNEL PAINT sprays everywhere.
            
            The walls of the vent now look like a long tunnel stretching
            into infinity. Your sense of direction inverts. Up becomes
            sideways. The vent is now a corridor is now a tunnel is now—
            
            You tumble out into the store, disoriented but intact.
            
            (Your clothes are now painted with depth perspective.

            *THWACK*
            
            Plywood. It was always plywood.
            
            From somewhere, a distant "meep meep."
            
            You slide down the boards, adding your silhouette to
            the collection of previous attempts.
            
            (Meanwhile, an ACME delivery truck drives straight through
            the same spot behind you. You don't see it. Nobody does.)

    INSIDE ACME SURPLUS (assuming you made it past the traps):
    
    Dust. Darkness. Empty shelves stretching into shadow.
    
    This was once a thriving gimmick emporium. Now it's a mausoleum
    of failed pivots. Price tags flutter in a draft from nowhere.
    Display cases hold nothing but regret.
    
    The lighting flickers — old fluorescents that never quite die.
    Cobwebs everywhere, but no spiders. They had better places to be.
    
    A layer of dust covers everything. Footprints show where
    someone walked recently. (Delivery drivers, probably.)
    
    The air smells like old cardboard, broken dreams, and something
    faintly... explosive?
    
    Through the front windows, you can see LEELA MANUFACTURING
    across the street. Lights on. People working. Success happening.
    
    The contrast hurts.

    THE SALES FLOOR:
    ════════════════
    Empty shelves organized by category:
    
    • PROJECTILES (empty) — Once held anvils, safes, grand pianos
    • PROPULSION (empty) — Rocket skates, jet packs, giant slingshots
    • PORTABILITY (empty) — Portable holes, instant tunnels, fold-up cliffs
    • PERSONAL (empty) — Disguise kits, female roadrunner costumes
    • PROBLEMATIC (locked) — "DO NOT OPEN" boxes, classified devices
    
    A few items remain:
    
    THE DISPLAY ANVIL:
    A single anvil on a pedestal. "DISPLAY MODEL — NOT FOR SALE"
    It's been here so long it's become furniture.
    
    THE RETURN COUNTER:
    Piled with defective products never picked up:
    • Rocket skates with broken ignition
    • A portable hole that became permanent
    • Several "bird seed" packages (contents unknown)
    • An angry letter from a coyote (sender address: desert)
    
    THE BACK ROOM:
    A door marked "EMPLOYEES ONLY — AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL — DANGER"
    Beyond it, darkness. And something that goes *tick tick tick*.
    
    THE OFFICE (upstairs):
    A spiral staircase leads up to where management used to sit.

      LEELA MANUFACTURING INTELLIGENCE
      ═════════════════════════════════
      Red brick. Three stories. Tall windows glowing with activity.
      People moving inside. Screens flickering. Work happening.
      
      A camera in the lobby window is pointed directly at YOU.
      CAM-ACME-01. The Tunnel Watcher.
      
      Every day, they look across at this ruin.
      Every day, they recommit to being the opposite.
      
      It should be humiliating.
      
      But ACME is beyond humiliation.
      ACME is beyond everything.
      ACME just IS.
      
  atmosphere: |
    The store is quiet. Too quiet.
    
    Occasionally: a creak. A shuffle. The tick-tick-tick from the back.
    Dust motes float in the dim light. Something watches from the shadows.
    
    This place feels like it's waiting for something.
    
    Maybe it's waiting for you to leave.
    Maybe it's waiting for the tunnel to work for everyone.
    Maybe it's just waiting.
    
    You should probably go.
    
  # THE FUN HOUSE OF HORRORS — DM TOOLKIT
  #
  # This abandoned store is a LIVE DEMONSTRATION of the ACME product catalog.
  # Every shelf, every shadow, every creaky floorboard can spring a trap.
  # The DM is encouraged to throw catalog products at intruders with
  # CREATIVITY, IRONY, and POETIC JUSTICE.
  #
  # See: ../w1/acme-catalog.yml for the full product catalog
  
  fun_house:
    philosophy: |
      ACME SURPLUS IS A PLAYGROUND OF CONSEQUENCES.
      
      You broke in. You were warned. Now you get the full ACME experience.
      
      The DM should treat this space as a living catalog demonstration:
      - Every product in the ACME catalog can appear here
      - Products activate based on player actions (ironic triggers)
      - Malfunctions happen TO the intruder, not the product
      - The funnier the setup, the better the payoff
      
      GUIDING PRINCIPLES:
      1. IRONY IS KING — The trap should relate to what the player just did
      2. JUSTICE IS POETIC — Greedy players find wealth-themed traps
      3. CREATIVITY IS REWARDED — Clever escape attempts trigger clever traps
      4. SURVIVAL IS POSSIBLE — Damage is comedic, not lethal (usually)
      5. LESSONS ARE LEARNED — Every trap teaches something about ACME
      
    trigger_philosophy: |
      WHEN TO SPRING A TRAP:
      
      • Player moves too quickly → ROCKET SKATES activate
      • Player reaches for something shiny → SPRING-LOADED BOXING GLOVE
      • Player tries to hide → ACME INVISIBLE PAINT (works backwards)
      • Player looks up → ANVIL (always look up first)
      • Player looks down → PORTABLE HOLE opens beneath them
      • Player touches a shelf → GIANT MAGNET pulls their equipment
      • Player makes noise → ACME GIANT NET deploys
      • Player tries to be clever → The CLEVERER trap triggers
      
    ironic_justice_examples:
      - trigger: "Player steals something"
        trap: "ACME Giant Magnet"
        irony: "The thing they stole attracts everything else in the room"
        
      - trigger: "Player tries to sneak"
        trap: "ACME Invisible Paint"
        irony: "Only THEY can't see themselves — everyone else can"
        
      - trigger: "Player runs"

      - trigger: "Player tries to climb"
        trap: "ACME Spring Shoes"
        irony: "They bounce, but can't stop bouncing"
        
      - trigger: "Player opens a box"
        trap: "ACME Mystery Box"

    # RUNTIME INSTANTIATION — YAML Jazz in Session Logs
    #
    # Traps are INSTANTIATED at runtime by blurting YAML Jazz code blocks
    # into the session log. Each instance:
    #   1. Points to a catalog entry as prototype
    #   2. Adds order customizations and parameters
    #   3. Can have properties narratively overridden as simulation evolves
    #
    # Example: When a player triggers a trap, the DM/LLM outputs:

        1. TRIGGER: Player does something that activates a trap
        2. INSTANTIATE: DM outputs YAML Jazz block in session log
        3. EXCERPT: Block references catalog entry as prototype
        4. CUSTOMIZE: Add instance-specific parameters
        5. NARRATE: Properties evolve through prose description
        6. RESOLVE: Trap completes, state becomes history

        ```
        
      narrative_evolution: |
        After instantiation, the simulation evolves through NARRATIVE:
        
        "The rocket skates ignite. Velocity: 10 mph. 20. 40.
         The player careers through the store, bouncing off shelves.
         Velocity: 60 mph. The back wall approaches.
         
         *CRASH*
         
         They land in the alley. Smoking slightly.
         The skates power down. Velocity: 0."
         
        The `state.velocity` is never explicitly edited — it's NARRATED.
        The YAML provides structure. The prose provides evolution.

        DM: Your fingers touch the glass—
        
        *SPROING*
        
        A boxing glove on a spring rockets out of the display!
        Spring tension: releasing. Extension: 50%. 75%. FULL.
        
        *THWACK*
        
        You stagger backward, seeing stars. The watch is still in the case.
        The boxing glove retracts slowly, as if satisfied.
        
        State: You take 1d6 blunt damage. The glove resets.

      THE DM'S ACME ARSENAL
      ═════════════════════
      
      The following products are "in stock" in the abandoned store and
      can be triggered at the DM's discretion. All products reference
      ../w1/acme-catalog.yml for full specifications.
      
      PROJECTILES (fall from above):
      • ACME Anvil (1 Ton) — Classic. Falls on command. 50% hits you.
      • ACME Grand Piano — Dramatic. Musical. Plays sad note on landing.
      • ACME Safe (2 Ton) — Heavier. You might end up inside it.
      
      PROPULSION (activate under feet):
      • ACME Rocket Skates — No steering. Random destination.
      • ACME Spring Shoes — Can't stop bouncing.
      • ACME Jet Pack — Ignites in wrong direction.
      
      ENVIRONMENTAL (triggered by presence):
      • ACME Portable Hole — Opens beneath you. Leads somewhere unexpected.
      • ACME Instant Tunnel Paint — Reality distortion zone.
      • ACME Quicksand Seeds — Someone planted them. You found them.
      
      RESTRAINTS (triggered by action):
      • ACME Giant Net — Enthusiastic deployment.
      • ACME Super Glue — Sticks you to whatever you touched.
      • ACME Bear Trap (XL) — Catches you while you look at it.
      
      PSYCHOLOGICAL (triggered by investigation):
      • ACME X-Ray Specs — Only sees skeletons. Everything looks scary.
      • ACME Thought Bubble Reader — YOUR thoughts become visible.
      • ACME Fourth Wall Breaker — The audience talks back. Rudely.

      RANDOM ENCOUNTER TABLE (d6)
      ═══════════════════════════
      
      Roll when player enters new area, touches something, or gets too clever:
      
      1. ANVIL DROP — Something falls from above. Roll to dodge.
      2. FLOOR TRAP — Something activates underfoot. Roll dexterity.
      3. ENVIRONMENT — Something in the room changes. Roll perception.
      4. RESTRAINT — Something tries to catch you. Roll escape.
      5. PSYCHOLOGICAL — Something messes with your mind. Roll wisdom.
      6. CHAIN REACTION — Two things happen at once. Roll luck.
      
      SEVERITY TABLE (d4)
      ════════════════════
      
      1. MINOR — Embarrassing but harmless. Pie to the face.
      2. MODERATE — Painful but recoverable. Rocket skates ride.
      3. MAJOR — Significant consequences. Trapped in safe.
      4. SPECTACULAR — Full cartoon physics. Through the roof.

      POETIC JUSTICE FORMULA
      ══════════════════════
      
      When a player does X, the trap should be anti-X or ironic-X:
      
      PLAYER ACTION          →  IRONIC CONSEQUENCE
      ───────────────────────────────────────────────
      Steals                 →  Loses something valuable
      Sneaks                 →  Becomes extremely visible
      Rushes                 →  Gets moved even faster (wrong direction)
      Hides                  →  Gets spotlighted/exposed
      Investigates carefully →  Something happens anyway
      Ignores warning        →  Warning was accurate
      Reads fine print       →  Fine print reads them
      Touches "Do Not Touch" →  Now can't stop touching

      HOW INTRUDERS CAN SURVIVE (for the DM to hint at)
      ══════════════════════════════════════════════════
      
      The fun house is dangerous but NOT inescapable. Survival is possible
      for players who:
      
      1. RESPECT THE PRODUCTS — Treating ACME items carefully reduces triggers
      2. WATCH FOR SIGNS — Scuff marks, scorch marks, impact silhouettes
      3. MOVE SLOWLY — Speed triggers propulsion traps
      4. LOOK UP FIRST — Always check ceilings before entering areas
      5. NEVER TOUCH DISPLAYS — The display anvil is actually harmless
      6. READ THE LABELS — Warning labels are usually accurate
      7. LEAVE QUICKLY — The store WANTS you gone; exit traps are minimal

      THE BACK ROOM — THE BOX THAT WORKS
      ═══════════════════════════════════
      
      If players make it to the back room and find "The Box That Works,"
      they've found the most dangerous thing in the building.
      
      It's an ACME product that works PERFECTLY.
      
      - No malfunction chance
      - Does exactly what it says
      - Flawless execution
      
      The terrifying part: ACME doesn't know WHY it works.
      They're afraid to ship it.
      They're afraid to open it again.
      They're afraid of what it means about the OTHER products.
      
      If a player opens it, the DM should invent something that works
      perfectly — and is therefore deeply, existentially wrong in context.
      
    final_note: |
      REMEMBER: THIS IS PLAY-LEARN-LIFT
      ══════════════════════════════════
      
      The fun house teaches through experience:
      - PLAY: The traps are funny, not frustrating
      - LEARN: Each trap demonstrates a catalog product
      - LIFT: Survival makes players feel clever
      
      The goal is not to punish the players.
      The goal is to make them LAUGH while being punished.
      
      ACME's products don't work as intended.
      But they WORK.
      Just not the way you want them to.
