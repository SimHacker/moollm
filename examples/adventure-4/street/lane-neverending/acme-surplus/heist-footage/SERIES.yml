    VISUAL LANGUAGE:
    - Security camera aesthetic — wide angle, slight fisheye
    - Timestamp overlay: "ACM1 — 2026-01-22 — 23:XX:XX"
    - Night vision green or sodium streetlight amber
    - Grain, compression artifacts, surveillance feel
    - Distance — we're across the street, voyeuristic
    
    COMPOSITION:
    - ACME storefront dominates frame
    - Street between camera and building
    - Painted tunnel visible on facade
    - Occasional pedestrian for scale
    - The sense of WATCHING something we shouldn't
    
    WHAT WE SEE:
    - The exterior: approach, entry attempts, escapes
    - Through windows: glimpses of interior chaos
    - The painted tunnel: packages flying through (not them)
    - Consequences: characters ejected, bouncing, flattened
    
    WHAT WE DON'T SEE (but know):
    - Donna in her basement throne, WATCHING, NARRATING
    - The levers being pulled
    - The internal journey (only what escapes outside)

    frame_04: "First Contact — Something happens. We see the flash."
    frame_05: "Deeper Trouble — Through windows: chaos. Conveyors? Bouncing?"
    frame_06: "The Sprint — One figure ROCKETS out the side window"
    frame_07: "The Extraction — Emergency exit, smoking slightly"
    frame_08: "The Aftermath — They're across the street. Alive. Changed."

# PARALLEL TIMELINE — DONNA'S SELFIES
#
# Donna is documenting the SAME EVENTS from inside the control room.
# Her selfies are HER property, stored in HER character directory.
# They sync with heist frames but exist in their own timeline.
#
# The story can be told by INTERLEAVING:
#   heist frame 01 → donna selfie 01 → heist frame 02 → donna selfie 02 → ...
#
# Two cameras. Two owners. One disaster.

  relationship: |
    The heist footage is OBJECTIVE — what the Leela Cam sees.
    Donna's selfies are SUBJECTIVE — her POV, her captions, her filter.
    
    Same moments. Different angles. Different truths.
    
    Interleave for NARRATIVE PARALLAX:
    - Frame shows action (external)
    - Selfie shows reaction (internal)
    - Together they reveal the full picture
    
  sync_points:
    frame_01: "selfie-01-intruder-alert — 'LOOK WHAT I'VE FOUND!'"
    frame_02: "selfie-02-tunnel-watch — 'WATCH THIS!' + TUNNEL STATUS: ACTIVE"
    frame_03: "selfie-03-anvil-deployed — 'I DID THAT!' + ANVIL DEPLOYED"
    frame_04: "selfie-04-pending — (tunnel multiplication reaction)"
    frame_05: "selfie-05-pending — (deeper chaos celebration)"
    frame_06: "selfie-06-pending — (rocket skates moment)"
