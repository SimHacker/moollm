    The warehouse door opens onto... impossibility.
    
    Shelves stretch into darkness, far beyond the building's exterior walls.
    The ceiling is lost in shadow. Forklifts hum somewhere in the distance.
    Packages arrive and depart through the PAINTED TUNNEL in the far wall —
    the same tunnel that doesn't work for you out front.
    
    This is ACME's distribution network. Bigger on the inside.
    Mail-order reality.
    
  atmosphere: |
    Industrial lighting buzzes overhead. Concrete floors stretch forever.
    The shelves are labeled with product codes you don't recognize.
    Some boxes move when you're not looking at them.
    Forklifts operate themselves. You never see the drivers.
    
    Occasionally, a package launches itself toward the tunnel.
    
    This place serves customers you'll never meet,
    through logistics you'll never understand.
    
  # TRAP DEPLOYMENT GUIDANCE — For the DM/LLM
  #
  # This room is INDUSTRIAL HAZARDS meets ACME CATALOG DEPLOYMENT.
  # The inventory IS the trap system. Products fall, launch, activate.
  # Deploy traps that are:
  # - Heavy (anvils, safes, pianos)
  # - Propulsive (rocket skates, springs, catapults)
  # - Spatial (portable holes, folded cliffs, impossible geometry)
  #
  # See: w1/acme-catalog.yml → traps_and_devices, adventure_gear
  
  trap_themes:
    primary: [industrial, projectile, propulsion, logistics]
    secondary: [infinite, spatial, automated]
    mood: "warehouse horror, but funny"
    
    catalog_sections:
      - traps_and_devices  # Anvils, pianos, dynamite, giant rubber bands
      - adventure_gear     # Portable holes, jet packs, instant boulders
      - hunting            # Nets, bear traps, quicksand seeds
      
    irony_patterns:
      - "Player dodges one thing → launches into another"
      - "Player hides behind boxes → boxes are the trap"
      - "Player follows the safe path → path IS the trap (conveyor)"
      - "Player reaches for valuable item → item is bait"
      
    example_encounters:
      - trigger: "Walking between shelves"
        suggestion: "ACME Anvil (1 Ton) — falls from high shelf, 50% hits you"
      - trigger: "Stepping on marked floor"
        suggestion: "ACME Spring Floor — launches you into shelving"
      - trigger: "Taking a product from shelf"
        suggestion: "ACME Giant Net — shelf was rigged"
      - trigger: "Following painted arrows"
        suggestion: "Arrows lead to conveyor belt → ACME Catapult at end"
        
  # THE TUNNEL
  the_tunnel:
    location: "Far wall, past the infinity of shelves"
    appearance: "The same painted tunnel from outside — but from the inside"
    behavior: |
      Packages launch themselves through it constantly.
      Forklifts drive through casually.
      Delivery drivers wave as they pass.
      
      You still cannot use it.
      
      It's not fair. But ACME products never were.
      
  # INFINITE INVENTORY
  infinite_inventory:
    principle: |
      The warehouse contains EVERYTHING in the ACME catalog.
      Infinite stock. Impossible logistics.
      
      If a player asks "is there a [product]?" — yes.
      The question is: can they get it without triggering it?
      
    dm_note: |
      Any ACME catalog product can be "found" here.
      Finding it = risk of activation.
      Taking it = higher risk.
      Using it = standard malfunction chance.
