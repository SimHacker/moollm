# 🔒 ACME Basement

> You shouldn't know this exists.

The basement is older than the building above it. Concrete walls that predate ACME's lease. Cables snake along the ceiling toward somewhere important. Climate-controlled. Something down here needs to be kept at EXACTLY the right temperature.

Cold War legacy equipment. Bakelite consoles from the 1940s. Reel-to-reel banks. Still running. Donna knows you're here — the intercom crackles.

## Exits

- **Up** → [Warehouse](../warehouse/) — the freight elevator
- **Control Room** → `control-room/` — locked, requires Donna's permission

## Objects

- `reel-to-reel-bank.yml` — 1970s communications archive
- `bakelite-console.yml` — 1940s equipment, still operational
- `tube-amplifier-rack.yml` — warm glow, warm signal
- `switchboard.yml` — connects to... what?

## Security
