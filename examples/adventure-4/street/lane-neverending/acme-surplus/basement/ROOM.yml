    You shouldn't know this exists.
    
    The basement is older than the building above it. Concrete walls 
    that predate ACME's lease. Humming machinery. Cables snaking along 
    the ceiling toward... somewhere important.
    
    The air is cool. Dry. Climate-controlled.
    Something down here needs to be kept at EXACTLY the right temperature.
    
    The lights flicker in a pattern that might be morse code.
    (It's not. It's just old wiring. Probably.)
    
  atmosphere: |
    Industrial hum. The smell of ozone and old concrete.
    Emergency lighting casts everything in pale blue.
    
    This place has the energy of a Cold War listening post.
    Banks of equipment that predate ACME's lease — reel-to-reel recorders,
    switchboards with too many lines, oscilloscopes tracing patterns
    that might be signals or might be ghosts.
    
    And underneath that: something OLDER.
    
    Bakelite. Everywhere. That dark brown phenolic resin from
    before plastic was cheap, before electronics were disposable.
    Bakelite dials with chrome bezels. Bakelite phone housings,
    heavy as weapons. Bakelite switch plates, warm to the touch
    from decades of current flowing through.
    
    The aesthetic is layered like archaeology:
    - 1940s: Bakelite and brass, Art Deco curves, HEAVY
    - 1970s: Steel and tape, Cold War paranoia, ANGULAR  
    - 2020s: Donna's monitors and levers, SURVEILLANCE
    
    Three generations of WATCHING, stacked on top of each other.
    Each one thought they were the last. Each one was wrong.
    
    Someone was HERE before Donna. Someone who listened.
    Someone who routed calls that couldn't be traced,
    passed messages that couldn't exist,
    kept secrets for people who couldn't be named.
    
    The equipment still works. Some of it still RUNS.
    Tapes turn slowly in machines nobody feeds.
    Recording what? For whom? After all this time?
    
    Donna found it like this. She didn't ask questions.
    She just... added her monitors. Her levers. Her chair.
    
    The old equipment hums alongside the new.
    Two surveillance systems. Two eras of paranoia.
    One basement. One purpose: WATCHING.
    
    The cables all lead in one direction.
    Toward a door marked:

    Monologuing, really.

      Someone was here before Donna.
      
      The equipment suggests late Cold War — 1970s, early 1980s.
      A communications nexus. A listening post. A place where calls
      got routed through cutouts, where messages were encoded and decoded,
      where someone sat for YEARS in the blue emergency light,
      headphones on, writing down things that couldn't be written down.
      
      They left in a hurry. Or they didn't leave at all.
      The equipment was running when ACME took the lease.
      Nobody knew who to call to turn it off.
      Nobody WANTED to call.

          The bakelite equipment has that heft. That PERMANENCE.
          They built things to LAST in the '40s. To survive.
          To keep working after... whatever they were preparing for.
          
          Some of it still works. The tubes still glow orange.
          The dials still turn with satisfying clicks.
          The bakelite is warm. Always warm.
          
          It shouldn't still be running.
          Nobody's maintained it since before Donna was BORN.
          
          And yet.

      "I don't TOUCH it. It does its thing. I do mine.
       
       Sometimes the tapes... change direction. On their own.
       Sometimes a light on the switchboard blinks.
       Line 23. Always line 23.
       
       I don't answer it. I don't LOOK at it.
       
       We have an UNDERSTANDING, the old equipment and me.
       I don't ask what it's recording.
       It doesn't ask about the anvils.
       
       COEXISTENCE. Very professional. TREMENDOUS arrangement."

      "The BROWN stuff? The HEAVY stuff?
       
       That was here before the COLD WAR stuff.
       Before the tapes. Before the switchboard.
       That stuff is from... I don't know. The '40s? Earlier?
       
       It's WARM. Always warm. Like something's running inside.
       The tubes glow. ORANGE. Very cozy. Very UNSETTLING.
       
       I tried to unplug the big console once.
       Just to see what it was connected TO.
       
       It wasn't connected to ANYTHING.
       
       ...
       
       I don't try to unplug things anymore.
       I just let them HUM.
       We have an UNDERSTANDING."
