# 🍄🎚️ ACME Security Control Room

> *"We put the FO in FAFO! And the FU in FUN!"*

The nerve center of ACME Wholesale security operations. A small room with 47+ monitors, banks of brass levers, and one very attentive operator.

## Occupant

**Donna Toadstool** — Security Consultant  
*"I'm SAVING the black lever. For someone SPECIAL."*

She sits in the throne-like ergonomic chair, watching every monitor, ready to pull every lever. This is her kingdom.

## Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **The Throne** | Ergonomic chair perfectly positioned to see all monitors and reach all levers |
| **The Levers** | Banks of brass levers — red (anvils), blue (conveyors), yellow (springs), green (nets) |
| **The Monitors** | 47+ screens showing every angle of ACME, including angles that shouldn't exist |
| **The Coffee Machine** | Works perfectly. This is deeply unsettling in context. |
| **The Black Lever** | Under glass. Pristine. Never touched. Warm. She's saving it. |
