    "This pass grants access to ALL ACME facilities including
     but not limited to: warehouses, tunnels (painted and real),
     control rooms, break rooms, and the INFINITE AISLES.
     
     Loss of this pass should be reported to NOBODY because
     DONNA NEVER LOSES ANYTHING."
     
    There's a small note taped to the back in Donna's handwriting:
    "If found, return to ME. Not HR. ME. — D.T."

           the tunnel? The tunnel that I CONTROL?

           You've got GUTS, Gutsy Gary. I respect that.
           
           No."

        possibilities:
          - "Information about other intruders (she likes intel)"
          - "A really good nickname for yourself"
          - "Promise to come back and trigger MORE traps"

          If Donna notices it's missing, she will be... DISPLEASED.
          But she can't leave the control room to chase you.
          That's not how this works.

        The pass hums. The painted wall shimmers.
        You step through like an ACME employee.
        
        Somewhere, Donna is SCREAMING into the PA system:
        "THAT'S MY PASS! THAT'S MY PASS, THIEVING THEO!
         YOU CAN'T JUST—  YOU CAN'T—
         
         ...
         
         FINE. It still works. But I'LL REMEMBER THIS."

       YOU. You took it. DIDN'T YOU.
       
       You came into MY control room. You DISTRACTED me.
       And you STOLE my PASS.
       
       ...
       
       I'm impressed, Pilfering Pete. TREMENDOUSLY impressed.
       
       But know this: every time you use that pass,
       I'll KNOW. I'll be WATCHING. And I'll be NARRATING.
       
       You want tunnel access? FINE. But you'll EARN it.
       Every. Single. Time."

  meta:
    purpose: |
      This is the "legitimate" way to get tunnel access if you don't have
      the acme tag naturally. Sneak into the control room (hard), steal
      the pass (medium), use the tunnel forever (with Donna's commentary).
      
    gameplay_loop: |
      1. Find way into basement (warehouse stairs, difficult)
      2. Reach control room (survive Donna's traps)
      3. Steal pass while Donna monologues (distraction + stealth)
      4. Use pass to access tunnel from either direction
      5. Enjoy permanent Donna harassment as consequence
