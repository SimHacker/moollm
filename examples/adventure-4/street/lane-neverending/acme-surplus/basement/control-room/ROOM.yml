#
# LITERARY RESONANCES — The Petty God Archetype
#
# EXCELSIUS IN THE BOX (Lem, "The Cyberiad"):
#   Trurl builds a deposed tyrant a microscopic kingdom where he can oppress
#   tiny subjects forever. The king is DELIGHTED. Absolute power over a
#   domain small enough to control completely. That's Donna's warehouse.
#
# THE MAN BEHIND THE CURTAIN (Wizard of Oz):
#   Small figure, tremendous voice, ALL the levers. The illusion of power
#   that IS power because the subjects believe it. Donna doesn't need to
#   BE an all-powerful AI — she just needs the INTERCOM and the ANVILS.
#
# THE MAN IN THE PLANET (Lynch, "Eraserhead"):
#   Sitting in industrial darkness, pulling levers that control... something.
#   We never know what. That's the horror. The levers DO things, but the
#   relationship between lever and effect is UNKNOWABLE. Donna pulls levers.
#   Anvils fall. Is it the lever? Is it her will? Does it matter?

    You found it.
    
    A small room. Walls of monitors — dozens of them — showing every angle
    of the warehouse, the back room, the sales floor, the street outside.
    Every aisle. Every shelf. Every rat.
    
    In the center: banks of brass levers, worn smooth with use.
    Some are labeled. Most are not.
    One — the black one — has never been touched.
    
    And in the middle of it all: a single chair.
    Ergonomic. Adjustable. THRONE-LIKE.
    
    Occupied.
    
  atmosphere: |
    The hum of monitors. The glow of screens. The smell of good coffee.
    
    This is the nerve center. The seat of power. The kingdom.
    
    She's been waiting for you.
    
    "Well, well, well. Basement Barry made it to the INNER SANCTUM.
     Very IMPRESSIVE. Very PERSISTENT. Very DOOMED.
     
     Nobody gets in here. NOBODY. I don't even let the JANITOR in.
     
     And yet... here you are. Looking at my LEVERS.
     Looking at my MONITORS. Looking at MY CHAIR.
     
     ...
     
     I'm going to give you a CHOICE, Barry.
     First choice anyone's ever gotten in here.
     
     Leave now. Go back up. FORGET.
     
     Or... stay. And FIND OUT what happens when someone
     gets THIS close to the BLACK LEVER."
     
  # THE THRONE
  the_chair:
    type: object
    name: "Donna's Throne"
    description: |
      Ergonomic. Adjustable. Leather. THRONE-LIKE.
      
      It faces the monitors. All of them.
      It's positioned perfectly — she can see EVERYTHING from here.
      She can reach EVERY lever without standing.
      
      There's a coffee cup holder on the right arm.
      A tablet mount on the left.
      The cushions have molded to her shape over... how long?
      
    occupant:
      name: "Donna Toadstool"
      link: "../../../../../characters/fictional/donna-toadstool/CHARACTER.yml"
      status: "PRESENT — This is HER domain"
      
      note: |
        Donna runs ACME security. This is her THRONE.
        She spends most of her time here, watching, waiting, PULLING STRINGS.
        
        Yes, she's banned from LEELA premises — the AI company that monitors
        her social media caught her selfie and banned her from THEIR facilities.
        But ACME is not Leela. ACME is her CLIENT. Her KINGDOM.
        
        She sits here. She watches the monitors. She waits for intruders.
        And when they come — often because SHE tricked them into coming —
        she pulls the levers with TREMENDOUS satisfaction.
        
      tactics:
        luring_victims: |
          Donna has been known to ORCHESTRATE break-ins.
          She spreads rumors about "unguarded merchandise."
          She "accidentally" leaves doors unlocked.
          She posts about "security being down for maintenance."
          Then she watches them come. And she PULLS.
          
        tunnel_trap: |
          There's a tunnel. She knows about it. Most don't.
          Sometimes she opens it from this console.
          Intruders think they've found a SECRET ENTRANCE.
          They haven't. They've found a DELIVERY MECHANISM.
          The tunnel leads exactly where SHE wants them.
          
        the_commentary: |
          The best part isn't the anvils. It's the NARRATION.
          She watches them on the monitors. She gives them nicknames.
          She talks to them through the PA system.
          "Welcome, Sneaky Steve. I've been EXPECTING you."
          "Fumbling Frank, that's the WRONG lever. Well, for YOU it is."
          She enjoys her work. TREMENDOUSLY.
          
      leela_ban_clarification: |
        The Leela ban (see ../../security-ban-donna-toadstool.yml) only
        applies to LEELA facilities — the AI company's offices and properties.
        
        ACME Wholesale is a separate business. Donna is their security consultant.
        She can post all the selfies she wants here — it's HER control room.
        
        The irony: Leela banned her for exposing security layouts.
        ACME keeps her employed BECAUSE she's terrifying to intruders.
        Different priorities. Different clients. Same Donna.

          There was an incident. Three intruders. They had TOOLS.
          They thought they could DISABLE the system.
          
          She pulled the Big One.
          
          Nobody found them for THREE DAYS.

       You pull them. Things HAPPEN. Very simple. Very direct.
       
       Not like PEOPLE. People are COMPLICATED. People have FEELINGS.
       Levers? Levers just DROP ANVILS.

       Did you think I didn't KNOW about the tunnel?

# THE PETTY GOD — Extended Meditation

the_petty_god:
  archetype: "Tyrant of a Tiny Kingdom"
  
  philosophy: |
    The world is too big. You can't control it. You can't even INFLUENCE it.
    People don't listen. Systems are broken. The powerful are untouchable.
    
    But here? In this room? With these levers?
    
    Here, Donna is GOD.
    
    Not a big god. Not a COSMIC god. Just a god of aisles and anvils.
    A god of conveyors and commentary. A god of one industrial complex
    where the rules are HER rules and the penalties are IMMEDIATE.
    
    Is it petty? YES. TREMENDOUSLY PETTY.
    But it's HERS.
    
  the_delight:
    description: |
      She watches the monitors for HOURS. Waiting.
      
      When an intruder appears — and they ALWAYS appear eventually —
      something lights up in her. Not malice exactly. ENGAGEMENT.
      
      Finally. A SUBJECT. Someone to MANAGE.
      Someone whose fate she controls COMPLETELY.
      
      The nickname. The warning. The lever. The anvil.
      It's a RITUAL. It's WORSHIP (of herself). It's TREMENDOUS.
      
  excelsius_parallel:
    reference: "Stanisław Lem, 'The Cyberiad' — 'The Seventh Sally'"
    summary: |
      Trurl builds a deposed tyrant a microscopic kingdom in a box.
      Real subjects (or are they?). Real suffering (or is it?).
      The king is DELIGHTED. He can be a monster forever.
      
      Donna's complex is her box.
      The intruders are her subjects.
      The ethical questions are... similar.
      
  the_man_in_the_planet:
    reference: "David Lynch, 'Eraserhead' (1977)"
    parallel: |
      Donna pulls the red lever. An anvil falls in Aisle 9.
      WHY Aisle 9? The lever isn't LABELED Aisle 9.
      
      Does she KNOW what each lever does? Or does she just... pull them?
      Does it MATTER, if the anvils fall ANYWAY?
      
      The Man in the Planet never speaks. Donna NEVER STOPS speaking.
      But the fundamental relationship is the same:
      
      A figure in darkness. Levers. Effects. The unknowable machinery of fate.
      
  loneliness:
    exists: true
    acknowledged: false
    description: |
      She's been in this control room for... how long?
      
      The coffee machine works. The monitors show everything.
      The levers are responsive. The intercom carries her voice.
      
      But nobody TALKS to her. Not really.
      The intruders scream. Beg. Run. Get flattened.
      They don't CONVERSE.
      
      Henk would understand this. The eternal vigil. The patient waiting.
      The knowledge that your purpose is to BE HERE, forever.
      
      But Donna would NEVER admit it.

       Who needs PEOPLE when you have ANVILS?
