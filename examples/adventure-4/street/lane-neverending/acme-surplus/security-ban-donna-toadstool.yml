      ACME Wholesale continues to employ Donna as security consultant.

      We cannot compel ACME to terminate her employment.
      We can only ban her from OUR facilities.

# SITUATION CLARIFICATION
situation:
  donna_employer: "ACME Wholesale (still employed, still running security)"
  leela_relationship: "None — we just monitor social media"
  
  what_happened: |
    Donna works for ACME. Donna posted selfies of ACME's control room.
    
    Leela's social media monitoring flagged the posts as OPSEC disasters.
    We notified ACME. We recommended termination.
    
    ACME's response: "She's terrifying to intruders. The selfies are free advertising."
    
    We cannot compel ACME to act. We CAN ban her from Leela facilities.
    So we did. Not that she was ever invited to any.
    
  current_status:
    donna_at_acme: "STILL EMPLOYED — running security from basement control room"
    donna_at_leela: "BANNED — not that she ever had business here"
    security_system: "ACTIVE — Donna at the helm, pulling levers, assigning nicknames"
    the_black_lever: "Still unpulled. She thinks about it sometimes."
    
  the_real_irony: |
    Leela banned someone from facilities she never visited
    for posting about facilities we don't control.
    
    Meanwhile she continues to post. ACME continues to employ her.
    And intruders continue to be FLATTENED with TREMENDOUS commentary.
    
    Our ban is mostly symbolic. But we feel better having it on record.

    "TREMENDOUS news! I have been BANNED from LEELA!
     
     Some AI company that monitors social media didn't like my ENGAGEMENT!
     They were THREATENED by my 847 likes!
     
     This is a WITCH HUNT. Very unfair. Many people are saying
     the REAL security risk is whoever's WATCHING MY FEED!
     
     (I don't even know what LEELA does. Do they have LEVERS?
     I bet they don't have levers. SAD.)
     
     Anyway I'm still running security at ACME. Where the REAL action is.
     The control room looked AMAZING in that selfie btw.

      - "the way she said 'no regrets' 💀"
      - "so you're still at ACME tho? pulling levers?"
      - "some AI company banned you for posting? that's wild"
      
  donna_reply_to_comments: |
    "I did NOT post the floor plan! I posted a SELFIE!
     The floor plan was just... in the background.
     VERY different things!
     
     And YES I'm still at ACME! Still running security!
     Leela is some AI company that monitors social media.
     They have NO LEVERS. Very sad for them.
     
     My control room looked TREMENDOUS in that selfie btw."

# LEELA SECURITY ASSESSMENT
leela_assessment:
  threat_level: "LOW — for Leela facilities"
  
  actual_concern: |
    Subject has never had business at Leela facilities.
    The ban is precautionary — we don't want her posting
    selfies of OUR control rooms if she ever visits.
    
    She's still actively employed at ACME. Still running their
    security. Still posting. Still pulling levers.
    
    That's ACME's problem, not ours.
    
  ongoing_monitoring: |
    We continue to monitor her social media because:
    1. It's entertaining
    2. She documents intruder fates (useful threat intel)
    3. She might accidentally photograph something about US
    4. The nickname generation is genuinely impressive
    
  status: "MONITORING — for entertainment as much as security"
  
  final_note: |
    The irony of banning a security consultant for security violations
    is not lost on this department.
    
    However, 847 likes and 234 shares of our trap system layout
    outweighs any irony considerations.
    
    She is permanently banned.
    
    The control room will operate in autonomous mode.
    The black lever will remain unpulled.
    
    She will post about this ban. She already has.
    That's fine. We expected it.
    
    At least she can't post from INSIDE anymore.
