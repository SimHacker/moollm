    A stone fountain in the center of a small plaza. Currently dry,
    but impressive in its recursive design.

    THE FOUNTAIN OF INFINITE LOOPS
    
    A masterwork of virtual-world sculpture:
    
    At the center, a stone figure holds a jug, pouring water into...
    another jug held by the same figure, which pours into...
    another jug held by the same figure, which pours into...
    
    It's recursive. It's impossible. It's deeply satisfying.

    The basin is cracked and dry. Leaves have gathered.
    Someone left a rubber duck in the empty pool.
    
    But the sculpture itself is beautiful — if you trace the water
    path with your eyes, you get dizzy. It has no beginning or end.
    
    (Just like Lane Neverending itself.)
    
  actions:
    TRACE:
      description: "Follow the water path with your eyes"
      effect: |
        You trace the path: jug to jug to jug to jug...
        
        Your eyes spiral. Your brain protests.
        
        For a moment, you understand recursion on a visceral level.
        Then the moment passes and you're just dizzy.
        
    WISH:
      description: "Toss a coin and make a wish"
      effect: |
        You toss a coin into the empty basin.
        
        *clink*
        
        It joins a small pile of coins from hopeful passers-by.
        Wishes made to a dry fountain. Hope persists anyway.
        
        (Your wish is noted. Results may vary.)
        
    DUCK:
      description: "Examine the rubber duck"
      effect: |
        A yellow rubber duck sits in the dry fountain basin.
        Someone drew a tiny hat on it with marker.
        A label on the bottom: "DEBUG DUCK — For Testing Purposes"
        
        It squeaks when you squeeze it.
        
        For some reason, this makes you feel better.
