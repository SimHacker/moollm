# The abandoned ACME Surplus store

object:
  name: ACME Surplus Storefront
  type: building
  portable: false

  description: |
    A dusty storefront with a faded sign: "ACME SURPLUS — EVERYTHING MUST GO"
    Everything did go. The store is empty now.
    
    One section of the windows is boarded up. Someone has painted
    a TUNNEL on the boards — a perfect trompe l'oeil leading into
    darkness. It looks... very runnable.
    
  examine: |
    ACME SURPLUS — 12 LANE NEVERENDING
    
    The windows are dusty but not boarded. Inside, empty shelves
    stretch into darkness. A few price tags flutter in a draft
    from somewhere.
    
    THE SIGN:
    "ACME SURPLUS — EVERYTHING MUST GO!"
    (In smaller letters: "And it did. Sorry.")
    
    WINDOW DISPLAY:
    • An empty pedestal labeled "PORTABLE HOLE (SOLD)"
    • A sign: "ROCKET SKATES — OUT OF STOCK INDEFINITELY"
    • A faded poster of a coyote looking disappointed
    • One (1) slightly dented anvil (display model, not for sale)
    
    THE PAINTED TUNNEL:
    One section of window is boarded up with plywood. On the plywood,
    someone has painted a REMARKABLY convincing tunnel entrance.
    The perspective is perfect. The shadows are just right. It looks
    like you could run straight through into the hillside beyond.
    
    You cannot.
    
    Trust us.
    
    A small pile of impact marks and feathers at the base suggests
    others have tried. A sign has been added:
    
    "THIS IS A PAINTING. YOU CANNOT RUN THROUGH IT.
     (Yes, we know it looks real. That's the problem.)"
    
    THE DOOR:
    Locked, but the lock looks... negotiable. A small sign:
    "CLOSED FOR INVENTORY (checking what we have left: nothing)"
    
    A note taped to the door:
    "For genuine ACME products, visit The Rusty Lantern kitchen.
    We're not responsible for anything purchased there either."
    
    GRAFFITI:
    Someone spray-painted "MEEP MEEP" on the wall.
    Someone else crossed it out and wrote "TOO SOON."
    
  actions:
    PEEK:
      description: "Look through the dusty window"
      effect: |
        You cup your hands against the glass and peer inside...
        
        Empty shelves. Dust motes floating in dim light.
        A cash register that's clearly been cleaned out.
        
        But wait — is that a box in the back? Labeled...
        "DO NOT OPEN — SERIOUSLY — WE MEAN IT"?
        
        Probably nothing. Probably.
        
    KNOCK:
      description: "Knock on the door"
      effect: |
        *knock knock knock*
        
        Silence.
        
        Then, from deep inside: a distant *crash*, followed by
        what sounds like a "meep."
        
        ...probably just the building settling.
        
    READ_ANVIL:
      description: "Examine the anvil in the window"
      effect: |
        The anvil sits on a small pedestal. A tag hangs from it:
        
        "ACME ANVIL (Display Model)
        Weight: Exactly right for comedic timing
        Material: Cartoon-grade iron
        NOT FOR SALE
        
        (We learned our lesson.)"
        
    RUN_INTO_TUNNEL:
      description: "Sprint at the painted tunnel"
      aliases: [run, sprint, enter tunnel, go through tunnel]
      effect: |
        You back up. You stretch. You get a running start.
        
        The tunnel looks SO REAL. The physics say it should work.
        Everything about it says "run through me."
        
        You sprint. Full speed. Arms pumping. Wind in your face.
        
        *THWACK*
        
        You hit solid plywood. Of course you do. It's a painting.
        
        You slide down the boards, leaving a you-shaped impact mark
        that joins the collection of previous attempts.
        
        From somewhere nearby, you hear: "meep meep."
        
        You look around. Nobody's there.
        
        (You take 0 damage. Pride is another matter.)
        
    STUDY_TUNNEL:
      description: "Examine the painted tunnel closely"
      effect: |
        You study the painting carefully...
        
        It's REALLY good. Museum quality. The depth is perfect.
        The shadows are accurate to the current time of day.
        The darkness inside seems to... move?
        
        For a moment, you could SWEAR you see something running
        toward you from deep inside the painted tunnel.
        
        Then it's just paint again.
        
        A signature in the corner: "W.E.C. — I'll get it right next time"
        
  rumors:
    deliveries: |
      People say they've seen ACME delivery trucks emerge from the tunnel.
      
      At 3 AM, when nobody's watching, vans painted with the ACME logo
      roll out of the "painting" carrying crates to unknown destinations.
      
      Drones buzz through it like it's an open door.
      
      Delivery boys on bicycles pedal straight through without slowing,
      packages balanced on their heads, whistling cheerfully.
      
      Service technicians in jumpsuits disappear into it with toolboxes
      and emerge hours later, covered in soot, muttering about "the warehouse."
      
      But when YOU try it? Plywood. Every time.
      
      Some say you need an ACME Employee ID badge.
      Some say you need to not WANT it to work.
      Some say it only works if you're on the clock.
      
      Nobody knows for sure. The tunnel keeps its secrets.
      
  secret:
    the_back_room: |
      There IS something in the back. A single box that wouldn't sell.
      Inside: an ACME Product that works EXACTLY as intended.
      
      Nobody knows what to do with it.
      
      It's terrifying.
      
    the_tunnel: |
      The tunnel IS real. But only for:
      - Roadrunners
      - ACME employees (delivery, service, drone operators)
      - Anyone who genuinely doesn't think about it
      
      Everyone else just hits plywood.
      
      It's not fair. But then again, ACME products never were.
      
    acme_logistics: |
      The tunnel connects to the ACME Distribution Network — a series
      of painted tunnels, fake doors, and impossible spaces that span
      the entire virtual world.
      
      How do ACME products arrive so fast? The tunnel network.
      How do they always find you? The tunnel network.
      Why do the products never work right? That's a different department.
