# The abandoned ACME Surplus store

  name: ACME Surplus Storefront
  type: building
  portable: false
  status: closed

    A dusty storefront with a faded sign: "ACME SURPLUS — EVERYTHING MUST GO"
    Everything did go. The store is empty now.
    
  examine: |
    ACME SURPLUS — 12 LANE NEVERENDING
    
    The windows are dusty but not boarded. Inside, empty shelves
    stretch into darkness. A few price tags flutter in a draft
    from somewhere.
    
    THE SIGN:
    "ACME SURPLUS — EVERYTHING MUST GO!"
    (In smaller letters: "And it did. Sorry.")
    
    WINDOW DISPLAY:
    • An empty pedestal labeled "PORTABLE HOLE (SOLD)"
    • A sign: "ROCKET SKATES — OUT OF STOCK INDEFINITELY"
    • A faded poster of a coyote looking disappointed
    • One (1) slightly dented anvil (display model, not for sale)
    
    THE DOOR:
    Locked, but the lock looks... negotiable. A small sign:
    "CLOSED FOR INVENTORY (checking what we have left: nothing)"
    
    A note taped to the door:
    "For genuine ACME products, visit The Rusty Lantern kitchen.
    We're not responsible for anything purchased there either."
    
    GRAFFITI:
    Someone spray-painted "MEEP MEEP" on the wall.
    Someone else crossed it out and wrote "TOO SOON."

    PEEK:

      effect: |
        You cup your hands against the glass and peer inside...
        
        Empty shelves. Dust motes floating in dim light.
        A cash register that's clearly been cleaned out.
        
        But wait — is that a box in the back? Labeled...
        "DO NOT OPEN — SERIOUSLY — WE MEAN IT"?
        
        Probably nothing. Probably.
        
    KNOCK:
      description: "Knock on the door"
      effect: |
        *knock knock knock*
        
        Silence.
        
        Then, from deep inside: a distant *crash*, followed by
        what sounds like a "meep."
        
        ...probably just the building settling.

      description: "Examine the anvil in the window"
      effect: |
        The anvil sits on a small pedestal. A tag hangs from it:
        
        "ACME ANVIL (Display Model)
        Weight: Exactly right for comedic timing
        Material: Cartoon-grade iron
        NOT FOR SALE
        
        (We learned our lesson.)"
        
  secret:

      There IS something in the back. A single box that wouldn't sell.
      Inside: an ACME Product that works EXACTLY as intended.
      
      Nobody knows what to do with it.
      
      It's terrifying.
