    The street widens slightly here, making room for what was once
    a market square. The cobblestones form a circular pattern around
    a dry fountain — the FOUNTAIN OF INFINITE LOOPS, according to
    the plaque. Someone turned it off to save on water sprites.
    
    A few storefronts line the square, some occupied, some not.
    The feel is quieter here, further from the center's bustle.
    
    The lane continues in both directions. It never ends, after all.

    THE FOUNTAIN OF INFINITE LOOPS:
    A stone basin with a statue of a figure pouring water from a jug
    into... another jug held by the same figure. It's recursive.
    The water sprites went on strike. Now it's just decorative.
    A plaque: "Dedicated to all those stuck in while(true){}"
    
    STOREFRONTS:
    • 12 Lane Neverending — Something that was once a bakery (smell lingers)
    • 14 Lane Neverending — A curiosity shop (hours: "whenever")
    • 16 Lane Neverending — Shuttered, but a light flickers inside
    
    THE SQUARE:
    A few more benches. A public notice board with peeling posters.
    A small stage platform that's seen better days. Community events
    happened here, once. They could again.
