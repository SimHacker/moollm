    The street widens slightly here, making room for what was once
    a market square. The cobblestones form a circular pattern around
    a dry fountain — the FOUNTAIN OF INFINITE LOOPS, according to
    the plaque. Someone turned it off to save on water sprites.
    
    More empty storefronts, but these look like they were occupied
    more recently. A faded sign: "ACME SURPLUS — EVERYTHING MUST GO"
    (it did).
    
    The lane continues in both directions. It never ends, after all.

    THE FOUNTAIN:
    A stone basin with a statue of a figure pouring water from a jug
    into... another jug held by the same figure. It's recursive.
    The water sprites went on strike. Now it's just decorative.
    
    STOREFRONTS:
    • 12 Lane Neverending — "ACME SURPLUS" (closed, but the door creaks)
    • 14 Lane Neverending — Something that was once a bakery (smell lingers)
    • 16 Lane Neverending — Shuttered, but a light flickers inside
    
    THE SQUARE:
    A few more benches. A public notice board with peeling posters.
    A small stage platform that's seen better days. Community events
    happened here, once. They could again.
