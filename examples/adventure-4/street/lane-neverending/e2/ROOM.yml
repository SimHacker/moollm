    The street widens slightly here, making room for what was once
    a market square. The cobblestones form a circular pattern around
    a dry fountain — the FOUNTAIN OF INFINITE LOOPS, according to
    the plaque. Someone turned it off to save on water sprites.
    
    On the SOUTH side of the square, two notable residences:
    
    Number 13 — THE BARTLE RESIDENCE. Victorian terraced house,
    dark green door, bookshelves visible. Home of Dr. Richard Bartle,
    founder of MUD1. A brass dragon dozes inside.
    
    Number 15 — THE HOPKINS MOTORCOACH. Classic FMC 2900R, blue and
    white stripes, parked on a professional gravel pad. Home of Don
    Hopkins, consciousness programmer. Fully hooked up to utilities.
    A rabbit silhouette moves past the wide windshield.

    Neighbors. Friends. Virtual world founder and transformation
    subject, side by side on Lane Neverending.
    
    The lane continues in both directions. It never ends, after all.
    
  examine: |
    THE FOUNTAIN OF INFINITE LOOPS:
    A stone basin with a statue of a figure pouring water from a jug
    into... another jug held by the same figure. It's recursive.
    The water sprites went on strike. Now it's just decorative.
    A plaque: "Dedicated to all those stuck in while(true){}"
    
    NORTH SIDE (even numbers):
    • 12 Lane Neverending — Something that was once a bakery (smell lingers)
    • 14 Lane Neverending — A curiosity shop (hours: "whenever")
    • 14½ Lane Neverending — SEYMOUR BLOOMS. A narrow flower shop wedged
      between buildings. Grimy windows, something green glowing inside.
      You can hear singing. Feed me, Seymour...
    • 16 Lane Neverending — Shuttered, but a light flickers inside
    
    SOUTH SIDE (odd numbers):
    • 13 Lane Neverending — THE BARTLE RESIDENCE. Victorian terraced house,
      dark green door, bookshelves visible through bay windows. Home of
      Dr. Richard Bartle, founder of MUD1, creator of player types.
      A brass dragon dozes inside. Tea is probably being made.
    • 15 Lane Neverending — THE HOPKINS MOTORCOACH. Classic 30-foot
      FMC 2900R, blue/white stripes, parked on a gravel pad with full
      utility hook-ups. Home of Don Hopkins, consciousness programmer.
      Rabbit ears visible through the panoramic windshield. Sign:
      "Mobile Pie Menu Bakery (Modal dialogs are violence)."
    
    THE SQUARE:
    A few more benches. A public notice board with peeling posters.
    A small stage platform that's seen better days. Community events
    happened here, once. They could again.

        A modest Victorian terraced house on the south side of the square.
        Dark green door, brass "13" plate, tall bay windows showing
        bookshelves within. A small plaque by the door reads:
        
        "Where thoughts become worlds,
         and worlds become understood."
        
        Through the window, you can see the edge of the famous Study.
        A brass dragon dozes on what might be a radiator.
        The smell of tea drifts from somewhere inside.
        
        This is the home of Dr. Richard Bartle, founder of MUD1,
        creator of the player types taxonomy, and keeper of virtual
        world history.
