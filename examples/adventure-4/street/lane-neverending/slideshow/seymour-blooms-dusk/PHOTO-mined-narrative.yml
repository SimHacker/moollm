    The shop is closed, but the window is alive. Ada II leans forward,
    caught mid‑sneak, framed by vines and blossoms like a secret that
    forgot to hide.
  story_beats:
    - "after-hours glow turns the florist into a stage"
    - "Ada II blends in, then notices the camera"
    - "knowledge replaces hunger: books, code, and a laptop hum"
  tone:
    - "whimsical, conspiratorial"
    - "Little Shop homage without the bite"
