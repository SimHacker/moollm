# Seymour Blooms at Dusk — Ada II in the Window

## The Scene

It is dusk on Lane Neverending, the pavement still wet and glossy. Seymour Blooms is closed — the door sign says so — but the lights are on inside, warm and amber, as if the shop is thinking late into the evening.

The big display window glows. Rain speckles the glass. Through that soft, reflective pane you see the surprise: Ada II. A giant, singing‑plant silhouette, half‑hidden among books, papers, and messy stacks of programming language manuals. She is not supposed to be in the front window. She is caught. Her leafy mouth hangs open in shock, as if the camera startled her.

The mood is Little Shop of Horrors without the horror — a mischievous Audrey II who feeds on knowledge instead of blood. She loves code, diagrams, and long, late YouTube lectures. A tangle of vines curls around a stack of notebooks. A paperback about Lisp leans against a pot. The shop looks like it was closed in a hurry and then kept alive by curiosity.
