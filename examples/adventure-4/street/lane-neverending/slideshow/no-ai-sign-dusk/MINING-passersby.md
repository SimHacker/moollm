# MINING: Passersby Perspectives

Deep mining of the NO AI TOWER sign from the viewpoints of those who encounter it.

---

## The Lone Walker (in the image)

She's worked late again. Third time this week. The warehouse job doesn't care about your sleep schedule, and neither does the rent.

The sign catches her peripheral vision like it always does. **NO AI TOWER.** Three words, stacked like a threat or a promise. She's never been sure which.

*"What even is that place?"* she's asked herself a hundred times. Never gone in. The building is just a squat concrete thing — could be storage, could be offices, could be nothing. But that sign. That ridiculous, beautiful, obnoxious sign.

Tonight, with the wet street throwing pink light back at the sky, it looks almost religious. A shrine to something she doesn't understand.

She keeps walking. Lane Neverending has a lot more lane to go.

## The Delivery Driver

**4:47 PM — Manifest says "5½ Lane Neverending"**

"What kind of address is five-and-a-half?"

The GPS is confused. It keeps trying to route him to number 5 or number 6, neither of which exist. Just empty lots and that weird pink sign.

He pulls over, checks the package. Addressee: "THE OVERLORD." No last name. Just "THE OVERLORD" in all caps.

The sign buzzes. **NO AI TOWER.**

"One story," he mutters. "Some tower."

He leaves the package by the roll-up door. He doesn't knock. Something about this place says *don't knock.*

As he drives away, he could swear the sign buzzes louder. Like it was watching.

## The Teenager on a Bike

First time down this street. Shortcut someone told him about. "Lane Neverending — it's faster than Main."

The sign stops him cold.

**NO AI TOWER.**

He's seen plenty of signs. This one feels different. Like it's making eye contact.

He pulls out his phone to take a picture. The camera app freezes. Twice. Third time it works, but the photo comes out wrong — the letters are blurred, unreadable. Like the sign didn't want to be photographed.

He posts it anyway. Caption: "found the resistance lol"

Three people like it. One comments: "where is this?"

He doesn't remember. Lane Neverending, sure. But where on Lane Neverending?

He can't find it again.

## The Real Estate Developer

"Prime location. PRIME."

She's been eyeing this stretch for months. Industrial zoning, but it's changing. The city's pushing east. This whole area will be lofts and coffee shops in five years.

The only problem: **NO AI TOWER.**

She's made inquiries. The property isn't for sale. Hasn't been for decades. Ownership records are... unclear. Something about a trust. Something about a Dr. No, which can't be a real name.

"That sign has to go," she tells her team. "It's an eyesore. Draws the wrong crowd."

But every time she drives by — especially at dusk, when the neon catches the wet street — she forgets what she was planning. The sign is ugly. The sign is beautiful. The sign is *important* somehow.

She never makes an offer.

## The Street Photographer

**Golden hour. Finally.**

She's been waiting for this light. The way dusk in this city hits wet concrete — you can't plan for it, you can only be ready.

And then she sees it.

**NO AI TOWER.** Three words in hot pink neon, stacked over a nothing building, reflecting in puddles like the street is whispering the message back to the sky.

She shoots a whole roll. Digital, but she still thinks in rolls. The sign at f/2.8. The sign at f/8. The sign with the lone walker as scale reference. The sign alone, filling the frame.

Later, editing, she realizes: every photo feels like the sign is the subject. Even the ones where she was trying to shoot something else. The sign won't stay in the background.

She enters one in a contest. Category: "Urban Surrealism."

She wins.

## The Conspiracy Theorist

**"You SEE it, right?"**

He's been trying to explain this to his followers for months. The sign. The location. The way it doesn't show up on Google Street View — or didn't, until recently, and even now it's blurred.

"NO AI TOWER. Think about it. Who's against AI? Who has the resources to put up a 40-foot neon sign? Who owns a building at 'five-and-a-half' — a number that doesn't EXIST?"

His theory: The building is a front. The sign is a signal. To whom? He's working on that.

"And the name — Dr. No? Like the BOND VILLAIN? Nobody's named Dr. No!"

His video gets 47,000 views.

The building gets no new visitors.

The sign keeps buzzing.

## The AI Researcher

She shouldn't be here. It's embarrassing. Like a Christian visiting a Satanic temple out of curiosity.

But the sign. She had to see it.

**NO AI TOWER.**

"Is it a protest?" she wonders. "A philosophy? A company?"

She's read the forums. Some people say it's genuine anti-AI activism. Some say it's an AI company with a sense of humor. Some say it's performance art. Some say it's all of the above.

The building offers no answers. One story. Roll-up doors. Could be anything inside.

She takes a photo. Posts it to her private group chat with other researchers.

"Found the enemy HQ," she jokes.

Someone replies: "They're not the enemy. They're the question."

She doesn't know what that means.

She thinks about it for weeks.

## The Sign Itself

**(if it could speak)**

"They look up at me and they don't understand.

I'm not against them. I'm not for them. I'm ABOVE them. Literally. That's the joke.

Every night I light up. Every night the wet street mirrors me back. Every night someone walks by and wonders.

'NO AI' — they read it as a command. A protest. A warning.

But I'm just a sign. Glass tubes, bent hot. Gas that glows when electricity moves through it. A message spelled in physics.

The building beneath me is modest. One story. Dr. No's idea of humility.

The tower is ME.

I am the tower.

And I will keep saying 'NO AI' until the gas runs out or someone finally gets the joke."
