  premise: "A sign so large it feels like a building; a building so small it feels like a footnote"
  joke_engine:
    - "The message is the architecture"
    - "The tower is a sentence held up by steel"
    - "The sky is the real storefront"

  truss: "like a skeletal ladder trying to reach the word TOWER"
  letters: "hovering logic blocks, stacked by a stubborn hand"
  glow: "neon insistence leaking into puddles"
  notes: |
    The sign doesn’t dominate the block; it dominates the sky.
    The ground accepts the glow and repeats it back.

impossible_but_true:
  - "A one-story building casts a three-story shadow"
  - "The sign feels heavier than the roof it sits on"
  - "The glow makes the sidewalk feel lit from below"
