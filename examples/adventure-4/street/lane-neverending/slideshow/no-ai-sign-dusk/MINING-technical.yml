date: 2026-01-27

composition:
  framing: "low-angle street-level view, sign centered high in frame"
  perspective: "cat's-eye, strong upward tilt"
  focal_plane: "sign and roofline are sharp; background softens"
  depth_of_field: "moderate; street reflections remain readable"
  balance:
    left_weight: "dark foreground wall and lampposts"
    right_weight: "one-story building mass"
  notes: |
    The sign floats above the roofline on a metal truss, visually
    separated from the building. The sidewalk reflection leads the eye.

lighting:
  time_of_day: dusk
  key_light: "neon sign glow"
  fill: "ambient sky light"
  practicals:
    - "neon letters"
    - "street lamps"
  contrast: "hot pink neon vs cool blue dusk"
  reflections:
    surface: "wet sidewalk and street"
    effect: "magenta streaks across pavement"
  notes: |
    The neon dominates; the sky remains cool and clean.

palette:
  dominant_warm: "magenta, pink neon"
  dominant_cool: "blue-gray sky, slate building"
  accent: "orange band at horizon"
  confidence: 0.84

camera_guess:
  lens_equiv: "35mm-ish"
  angle: "low, upward tilt"
  exposure_bias: "+0.5 for neon glow retention"
  notes: "Highlights are preserved while reflections remain strong."

readability:
  signage_legibility: "very clear"
  building_detail: "simple, one-story block"
  street_detail: "wet texture and puddles visible"
