## Featured Shots

### NO AI Tower

<img src="./no-ai-sign-dusk/PHOTO.png" alt="NO AI Tower — featured photo" width="640">

The sign that turns a one-story building into a forty-foot statement. Neon, wet asphalt, and the unmistakable pink glow.

Mining: technical, narrative, cultural, phenomenology, absurdist, infrastructure, typography, sound, satellite, photographer, passersby.

### Leela Manufacturing (Dusk)

<img src="./leela-manufacturing-dusk/PHOTO.png" alt="Leela Manufacturing at dusk — featured photo" width="640">

Warm lobby light behind tall panes, brick washed in magenta spill, the calm counterpoint to the neon next door.

Mining: technical, narrative, cultural, phenomenology, absurdist, geometry, movie-producer, photo-expert, typography.

### ACME Surplus Tunnel Sequence

Five frames, one joke, escalating consequences. The tunnel dares, the wall answers, and the street keeps score.

#### Frame 1

The dare hangs in the air, and the street pretends not to notice until it does.

Mining: technical, narrative, cultural, smells, sound, tastes, absurdist.

#### Frame 2

<img src="./acme-surplus-dusk/PHOTO-002.png" alt="ACME Surplus — frame 2" width="640">

The wall answers with a flat, unforgiving lesson in perspective.

#### Frame 3

<img src="./acme-surplus-dusk/PHOTO-003.png" alt="ACME Surplus — frame 3" width="640">

Close-up pain, cartoon physics with real-world sting.

#### Frame 4

<img src="./acme-surplus-dusk/PHOTO-004.png" alt="ACME Surplus — frame 4" width="640">

The drone arrives with hardware and bad intent.

Mining: technical, narrative, cultural, smells, sound, tastes, absurdist.

#### Frame 5

<img src="./acme-surplus-dusk/PHOTO-005.png" alt="ACME Surplus — frame 5" width="640">

The truck ignores the rules and exits anyway.

### Gezelligheid Grotto (Dusk)

<img src="./gezelligheid-grotto-dusk/PHOTO.png" alt="Gezelligheid Grotto — featured photo" width="640">

The pub glow in the lane, cozy and impossible, a warm anchor in the pink spill.

Mining: technical, narrative, cultural, phenomenology.

### Seymour Blooms (Ada II)

<img src="./seymour-blooms-dusk/PHOTO.png" alt="Seymour Blooms — featured photo" width="640">

Closed shop, lights on, the plant that should not be seen caught mid-surprise.
