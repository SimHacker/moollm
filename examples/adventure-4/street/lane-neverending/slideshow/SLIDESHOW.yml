# This is NOT a room. NOT an object. Just... photos.
# Visual impressions from this stretch of road.
# No physical embodiment. No focus point.
# Just what you might see if you stopped and looked.

# What makes this a slideshow, not a room
nature:
  physical: false          # No physical embodiment
  navigable: false         # Can't "enter" it
  browseable: true         # Can flip through
  atmospheric: true        # Sets mood
  
  philosophy: |
    A slideshow is a collection of visual impressions.
    Not places you can go, but moments you can see.
    Like a photo album, but the photos are semantic.

# Photos are subdirectories
photos:
  pattern: "./*/"          # Each subdirectory is a photo
  required_files:
    - PHOTO.yml            # Structural skeleton (left eye)
    - PHOTO.md             # Rich narrative (right eye)
  optional_files:
    - "*.png"              # Generated image
    - "*.jpg"
    - "PHOTO-stereo.md"    # Combined prompt after triangulation

# What this slideshow captures

# Generation method
method:
  name: "Semantic Stereo Vision"
  description: |
    Two-eye triangulation for better depth perception:
    
    LEFT EYE (PHOTO.yml):
      Structural skeleton — pointers, references, metadata
      What IS there. What connects to what.
      YAML Jazz with semantic structure.
    
    RIGHT EYE (PHOTO.md):
      Rich narrative — description, atmosphere, emotion
      What it FEELS like. How light falls.
      Prose that paints.
    
    TRIANGULATION (renderer):
      Pass BOTH to image generator.
      The structural gives precision.
      The narrative gives soul.
      Together: depth perception.
