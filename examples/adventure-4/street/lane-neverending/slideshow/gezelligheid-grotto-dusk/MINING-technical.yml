focus: "composition, lighting, camera geometry, palette"

composition:
  framing: "tight storefront crop, symmetrical window/door grid"
  perspective: "street-level, straight-on with slight upward tilt"
  focal_plane: "shopfront plane; door and main window are sharp"
  depth_of_field: "moderate; background facade stays readable"
  balance:
    left_weight: "signage and door mass"
    right_weight: "lamppost glow and dark facade"
  notes: |
    The facade reads as a deliberate rectilinear grid.
    The lamp post anchors the right side and adds a warm highlight.

lighting:
  time_of_day: dusk
  key_light: "interior tungsten glow"
  fill: "ambient sky light, cool"
  practicals:
    - "hanging pendant lights inside"
    - "lamppost flame on sidewalk"
  contrast: "warm interior vs cool exterior"
  reflections:
    surface: "wet cobblestones and sidewalk sheen"
    effect: "warm amber streaks, subtle mirror of window light"
  notes: |
    The warm/cool split reinforces the cozy refuge effect.

palette:
  dominant_warm: "amber, orange, brass"
  dominant_cool: "blue-gray, slate, dark brick"
  accent: "gold lettering on black sign"
  confidence: 0.82

camera_guess:
  lens_equiv: "35mm-ish"
  angle: "slightly upward but mostly level"
  exposure_bias: "+0.3 to +0.7 for glow preservation"
  notes: |
    The window glow is preserved without blowing out highlights,
    suggesting careful exposure for interior warmth.

readability:
  signage_legibility: "very clear"
  interior_visibility: "clear silhouettes, tables, and counter"
  street_detail: "cobblestones readable, reflections visible"
  confidence: 0.86

exhausted: false
next_suggested_focus: "narrative and cultural anomaly layer"
