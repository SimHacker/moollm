  moment: |
    Someone commits to the tunnel and pays for it immediately.
    The wall answers with a comic-book punch; the illusion refuses
    to open, and the street laughs back.
  story_beats:
    - "build: the tunnel looks real for one heartbeat"
    - "impact: the runner hits flat paint"
    - "after: cartoon stars float where pride used to be"
  tone:
    - "slapstick reality check"
    - "urban magic that only works for ACME"
