    Rain thins to a mist as two umbrellas cross the street.
    The storefront looks closed, but the painted tunnel still pulls at
    the eye like a dare. The lamp makes a small stage of the corner.
  story_beats:
    - "approach: pedestrians pass without stopping"
    - "temptation: the tunnel promises a shortcut that cannot exist"
    - "pause: the street holds its breath in the amber pool"
  tone:
    - "quiet before mischief"
    - "cinematic rainy dusk"
