# ACME Surplus at Rainy Dusk — The Painted Tunnel

## The Scene

Same rainy dusk as the other Lane Neverending shots: the sky fading from blue to orange, the street wet and reflective. The camera is across the street at a safe distance, street level, framing the abandoned ACME Surplus storefront on the north side of the block.

The building is a one-story brick retail box with a deep, old-fashioned sign band. Big block letters read **ACME SURPLUS** and a sagging banner below says **EVERYTHING MUST GO**. The windows are dark and dusty. Boards cover the right-hand window, and on those boards the painted tunnel is the star: a crisp perspective illusion that promises a passage and instead offers a flat wall. The tunnel painting must be large, clear, and centered in the composition.

The street is quiet. A warm lamppost glow falls on the wet cobblestones. The paint on the tunnel catches a little of that amber and a faint magenta spill from down the block, while the rest of the facade stays cool and damp. The storefronts to the right are low and dark; the ACME wall is the brightest plane.

## The Contrast

Across the street, Leela glows with competence. Here, ACME is all promise and plywood. The tunnel does not open, but it still pulls your eye.

## Technical Notes for Rendering

- **Time**: Rainy dusk, moments after sunset, matching the Lane Neverending glow
- **Weather**: Wet pavement, sheen on cobblestones, light rain just passed
- **Angle**: Street level, across the street at a safe distance, slight upward tilt
- **Framing**: Full-frame photo, no borders, no captions; painted tunnel prominent and readable
- **Light**: Warm lamppost pool, cool ambient dusk, faint magenta spill from down the block
- **Street details**: Wet cobblestones, curb line, subtle puddles reflecting signage
- **Mood**: Abandoned but theatrical; the tunnel is the joke
