# Refinement — Narrative Constraints

Leela dominates the frame, with a low strip of storefronts visible to the right. Full-screen photo, no borders, no captions.

The magenta neon sign is out of frame, perched above a low-rise neighbor to the left; its light is not. The magenta spill is oppressive on the west facade and the light-colored sidewalk, washing the left-side windows. The lobby on the front facade stays warm amber.

Leela stays calm: five stories above the street, red brick, tall industrial windows, warm lobby glow. Signage is above the doors, centered, restrained: **LEELA**. Rooftop and basement exist but are not visible.

Cat’s-eye street-level, across the street, strong upward tilt; move down the street left and turn right. Same dusk gradient as the magenta sign image. Same wet pavement. Include a wrought-iron lamp post and a wooden bench in front.
