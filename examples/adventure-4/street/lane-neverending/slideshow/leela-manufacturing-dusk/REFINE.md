# Refinement — Narrative Constraints

Leela dominates the frame, but on its left, the right side of the neighboring one-story commercial building is visible. Full-screen photo, no borders, no captions.

The magenta neon sign is out of frame, perched above its one-story neighbor to the left; its light is not. The magenta spill is oppressive on the upper stories only, washing the left-side windows and the light-colored sidewalk, blasting into upper offices and casting magenta shadows across desks and walls. The ground floor stays warm orange because the one-story neighbor blocks windows there.

Leela stays calm: five stories above the street, red brick, tall industrial windows on upper stories, warm lobby glow. Signage is above the doors, centered, restrained. Rooftop and basement exist but are not visible.

Cat’s-eye street-level, across the street, strong upward tilt; move down the street left and turn right. Same dusk gradient as the magenta sign image. Same wet pavement. Include a wrought-iron lamp post and a wooden bench in front.
