# Leela Manufacturing at Dusk — The Neighbor in the Neon Spill

## The Scene

Same dusk as the magenta neon sign photo. Same sky gradient. Same wet street. Move a little down the street to the left, drop to cat’s-eye street-level, then turn the camera right so both neighbors share the frame.

Leela Manufacturing rises four stories above the street — lobby at ground level, then three working floors — brick and glass, a calm industrial face. The facade must show five distinct levels with clearly separated window rows: lobby level plus three upper-story bands. Show a corner view with two planes visible, so the west side wall has its own row of tall industrial windows. A basement and rooftop exist but are not visible from the street. The lobby glows warm behind tall panes. Above the doors, clean signage: **LEELA** — restrained, confident, almost shy next to the magenta neon next door.

And yet the neon is here too. It spills across the west edge of the upper stories and onto the light-colored sidewalk, a magenta wash that catches on steel trim, glass, and wet pavement. The west facade at street level is brick and takes the pink wash directly; the lobby is on the front facade and stays warm amber. The upper-story windows on the left side catch the magenta blast from the off-screen sign and the neighbor’s bright window glow. The magenta neon sign is off-screen to the left, while a low strip of storefronts to the right shows the spill in their windows. The bright, buzzing glow paints the quiet factory anyway.

## The Contrast

This is the joke in a different key:

- The sign shouts.
- The factory listens.

The pink glow is a reminder: all neighbors share light, even when they disagree.

## Technical Notes for Rendering

- **Time**: Dusk, moments after sunset, identical sky gradient to the magenta sign photo
- **Weather**: Clear, damp pavement from earlier rain
- **Angle**: Cat’s-eye street level, across the street, strong upward tilt; move left and turn right to reveal the west side facade depth
- **Framing**: Full-frame photo, no borders, no captions, no UI overlays; west side of Leela is visible and lit; right edge shows low storefronts catching the spill; sign remains off-screen left
- **Light**: Warm lobby glow on the front facade; hot pink spill across the west facade windows and light sidewalk
- **Street details**: Wrought-iron lamp post with warm flame, wooden bench with iron legs, wet cobblestones and gutter at curb
- **Mood**: Calm competence under a theatrical wash
- **Lens**: 35mm street focal length, shallow depth of field
- **Color**: Balanced between warm interior and cool dusk, with hot pink accents

## The Coherence Rule

This frame is a deliberate companion to the magenta sign shot:

- Same time and weather
- Same camera position and exposure profile
- Adjacent building, same side of the street
- The sign's glow unifies the sequence

One side of Lane Neverending, one moment, two neighbors.
