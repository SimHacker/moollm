note:
  use: "Do not include this file in generation inputs."
  reason: "Negative critique only; for post-review guidance, not prompt synthesis."

issues_observed:
  - "Rooftop letters appear ('LEELA' on the roofline)."
  - "Leela reads as fewer than five stories."
  - "Neon source appears directly in the right window (sign or tube visible)."
  - "Right side of the neighboring one-story commercial building is not clearly present; neighbor remains invisible."
  - "Pink spill is present but needs to read as oppressive intrusion into upper stories."

fixes_needed:
  building_scale: "five stories, modest industrial block"
  signage_location: "only above main doors, centered"
  roofline: "flat parapet with no rooftop letters"
  neon_visibility: "spill only, sign off-screen left; no tubes or letters in windows"
  neighbor_visibility: "show the right side of the neighboring one-story commercial building without the sign"
  spill_behavior: "magenta light should blast into upper-story windows and cast interior shadows"
