    THE GLITCH MEMORIAL BENCH
    
    Bronze, weathered by virtual rain, polished by countless visitors.
    The back is engraved:
    
    ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │                                                     │
    │           IN MEMORY OF GLITCH                       │
    │              (2011 - 2012)                          │
    │                                                     │
    │     The world of Ur lives on in all who played.    │
    │                                                     │
    │     "The giants still dream. We still remember."    │
    │                                                     │
    └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
    
    THE GARDEN:
    Flowers that shouldn't exist outside Ur, but somehow do:
    • Sparkly (glows faintly)
    • Awesome Stew ingredients (aromatic)
    • Paper trees (rustling softly)
    
    OFFERINGS LEFT BY VISITORS:
    • Fresh flowers (someone comes regularly)
    • A small Glitch avatar figurine
    • A burned-down candle
    • A note: "I still have my house key"
    • Another note: "Friendly remembers"
    
    Names scratched into the back of the bench — players who
    wanted to be remembered in Ur forever:
    
    GlitchGirl2011 · UrExplorer · TinySpecker · Rube42
    MazeRunner · JujuBeetle · ButterScotch · AlphaDreamer
    ... (hundreds more, in smaller and smaller letters)
    
  actions:
    SIT:

      effect: |
        You sit. The bronze is warm, despite the shade.
        
        For a moment, you hear distant music — the Glitch soundtrack?
        Laughter from a world that no longer exists.
        
        You feel... remembered. As if the bench knows you were here.
        
    LEAVE_OFFERING:
      description: "Leave something at the memorial"
      effect: |
        You add your offering to the collection. A small gesture.
        But small gestures are how worlds are built.
        
        The flowers seem to lean toward your gift.
        
    REMEMBER:
      description: "Think about Glitch"
      effect: |
        You close your eyes and remember — or imagine — Ur.
        
        Streets that twisted impossibly. Giants who dreamed the world.
        A community that loved each other fiercely for one brief year.
        
        When Glitch closed, they released everything to the public domain.
        The art. The music. The code. A final gift.
        
        "We were here. We mattered. Take what we made and make more."
