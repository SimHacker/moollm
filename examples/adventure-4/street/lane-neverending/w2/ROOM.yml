    The older district of Lane Neverending. The buildings here have
    that Habitat-era charm — chunky, pixelated in memory if not in
    actual appearance, designed when virtual real estate was infinite
    and optimism was the default.
    
    A MEMORIAL BENCH sits in a small alcove between buildings:
    
    "IN MEMORY OF GLITCH (2011-2012)
     The world of Ur lives on in all who played there.
     The giants still dream. We still remember."
    
    Flowers have been left recently. Someone still visits.
    
  examine: |
    THE MEMORIAL BENCH:
    Bronze, weathered, well-loved. Names are scratched into the back:
    players who wanted to be remembered. A small garden surrounds it —
    Glitch flowers that shouldn't exist outside Ur, but somehow do.
    
    THE BUILDINGS:
    • 2 Lane Neverending — Oldest building on the street. Foundation
      stones from the original Populopolis? Probably legend.
    • 3 Lane Neverending — A former guild hall, now quiet. The banner
      still flies: "AVATARS UNITED — SINCE '86"
    
    ATMOSPHERE:
    Reverent. This is where virtual worlds began, in spirit if not
    in literal geography. The air feels thick with nostalgia and
    the ghost-data of players long logged off.
