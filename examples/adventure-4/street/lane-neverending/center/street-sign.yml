    ┌────────────────────────────────┐
    │      LANE NEVERENDING          │
    │   ←  W  ·  7  ·  E  →         │
    └────────────────────────────────┘
    
    Below the main sign, a smaller plaque:
    
    "Named in tribute to the virtual worlds
     that came before and never truly ended:
     Habitat · Game Neverending · Glitch"
     
    Someone has stuck a small sticker on the post:
    "The lane never ends. Neither do we. 🌟"
