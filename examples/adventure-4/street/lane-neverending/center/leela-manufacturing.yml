    A converted factory building stands next to The Rusty Lantern,
    its brick facade softened by climbing ivy and glowing windows.
    
    The sign reads:

    Smokestacks rise from the roof, but instead of smoke, they emit
    occasional sparks of light — ideas escaping into the wild.
    
    Through the tall industrial windows, you glimpse movement:
    conveyor belts carrying glowing packets, robotic arms sorting
    through piles of... questions? The factory floor hums with
    purpose.

    LEELA MANUFACTURING INTELLIGENCE
    5 Lane Neverending (next to The Rusty Lantern)
    
    EXTERIOR:
    • Red brick, three stories, industrial chic
    • Tall arched windows (originally for natural light)
    • Loading dock on the side (DELIVERIES: RAW DATA)
    • Fire escape covered in potted plants
    • Rooftop garden visible from the street
    
    WHAT'S VISIBLE THROUGH WINDOWS:
    
    FLOOR 1 — THE INTAKE:
    Conveyor belts move constantly. Raw materials arrive:
    questions, problems, data, confusion. Workers sort them
    into categories. Some things go to processing. Others
    go directly to the Insight Furnace.
    
    FLOOR 2 — THE PROCESSING FLOOR:
    This is where the work happens. Agents at workstations.
    Whiteboards covered in diagrams. Small explosions of
    understanding. The occasional "EUREKA!" echoing through
    glass.
    
    FLOOR 3 — THE SHIPPING DEPARTMENT:
    Finished products: insights, solutions, knowledge packages.
    Wrapped carefully. Labeled with care. Sent out into the world
    via pneumatic tubes, drones, and the occasional enlightened
    pigeon.
    
    THE SMOKESTACKS:
    They don't emit pollution. They emit POTENTIAL.
    Sparks of ideas that didn't quite fit any order.
    Free-range insights. Open-source epiphanies.
    
    Anyone can catch one if they're paying attention.

  philosophy: |
    LEELA MANUFACTURING INTELLIGENCE
    
    We don't believe intelligence is a product.
    We believe it's a PROCESS.
    
    We manufacture the CONDITIONS for intelligence to emerge:
    - The right questions
    - The right environment  
    - The right collaborators
    - The right amount of coffee
    
    And then we get out of the way.
    
    What comes out the other end?
    Sometimes insight. Sometimes knowledge.
    Sometimes just better questions.
    
    That's manufacturing intelligence.
    
  tagline: "We manufacture the conditions for intelligence to emerge."
