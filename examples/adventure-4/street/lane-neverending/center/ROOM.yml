    You are standing on LANE NEVERENDING, a cobblestone street that
    stretches endlessly in both directions — or at least, that's what
    the name promises. In practice, it goes about three blocks each way
    before becoming "somewhere else."
    
    The street has the quality of a place that has always existed and
    always will. Avatars have walked here since the first virtual worlds.
    The cobblestones remember pixel feet.
    
    To the NORTH, the front door of THE RUSTY LANTERN stands invitingly
    open. A brass plaque by the door reads: "7 Lane Neverending — Est. ???"
    The sign creaks: warm light spills out.
    
The street continues EAST and WEST, lined with buildings both
    occupied and waiting. To the west, you can see the tall smokestacks
    of LEELA MANUFACTURING at 5 Lane Neverending, neighbor to the pub.
    
    A STREET SIGN stands at the corner:
    
    ┌────────────────────────┐
    │   LANE NEVERENDING     │
    │   ←  W  ·  7  ·  E  →  │
    └────────────────────────┘
    
  examine: |
    The street is wide enough for two carts to pass, paved with
    cobblestones worn smooth by generations of feet, hooves, and
    whatever else passes for locomotion in virtual worlds.
    
    FEATURES:
    • Wrought-iron lamp posts (magically lit at night)
    • A few wooden benches for watching the world go by
    • Cobblestones in a herringbone pattern
    • Drainage gutters (surprisingly sophisticated)
    • The occasional weed pushing through cracks (life finds a way)
    
    THE PUB (7 Lane Neverending):
    The Rusty Lantern's front facade. Bay windows glow warmly.
    A sandwich board advertises today's specials. The door is
    oak with brass fittings, heavy but welcoming.
    
THE ATMOSPHERE:
    This street feels... significant. Like the main street of
    every virtual world that ever was. Habitat's Populopolis.
    Glitch's whimsical lanes. Game Neverending's promise of
    infinite possibility.
    
    The street goes on. It never ends. That's the whole point.
    
  tribute: |
    LANE NEVERENDING — A tribute to:
    
    HABITAT (1986) — Chip Morningstar & Randy Farmer
    The first graphical virtual world. They coined "avatar."
    Populopolis was the main street. This is its descendant.
    
    GAME NEVERENDING (2002) — Stewart Butterfield, Ludicorp
    The MMO that became Flickr when they pivoted. The game
    never launched, but the name lives on. Here.
    
    GLITCH (2011) — Stewart Butterfield, Tiny Speck
    The whimsical MMO set in the world of Ur. When it closed,
    they released everything to the public domain. The giants
    still dream. The streets still remember.
    
    (Tiny Speck became Slack. Everything pivots eventually.
    But the lane? The lane never ends.)

      description: |
        The front door of The Rusty Lantern. Heavy oak, brass handle,
        warm light leaking from the frosted glass panels. The address
        plaque reads "7 Lane Neverending."
        
        A sandwich board: "COME IN! WE HAVE ALE AND STORIES."

    east:
      destination: ../e1/
      description: |
        Lane Neverending continues east, cobblestones stretching toward
        the morning sun (or afternoon, or whenever). More lamp posts.
        More possibilities. The street numbers climb.

      destination: ../w1/
      description: |
        Lane Neverending continues west, cobblestones stretching toward
        the setting sun (narratively speaking). The street numbers
        descend, but the lane itself? Never ends.
      aliases: [w, left]
      
ambience: |
    The sounds of a lived-in street. Distant conversation. A cart
    rattling somewhere. The creak of the pub sign. Birds on lamp posts.
    The occasional pedestrian nodding as they pass.
    
    It's the kind of street where nothing happens and everything
    could happen. The ur-street. The proto-lane.
