  description: |
    A velvet-lined gallery where Church doctrine meets NO‑AI product
    design. Display cases hold prototype mash-ups: bias lantern glass
    fused with safety interlocks, rubric cards etched onto metal tags,
    and a painted mural of K-lines as constellations.

    receipts close." The air smells like varnish and warm circuits.
