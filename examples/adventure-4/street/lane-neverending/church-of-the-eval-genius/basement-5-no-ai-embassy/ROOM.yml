room:
  name: "Church — NO-AI Embassy"
  type: embassy
  
  description: |
    A lavish sub-basement embassy where restraint and evaluation meet
    in velvet-lined pragmatism. The long table is inlaid with circuit
    diagrams and rubric glyphs. A chandelier of calibrated lenses
    throws patterned light across walls hung with cross-referenced
    treaties, bias lantern glass, and NO-AI product schematics.
    
    This is the Church's NO-AI embassy — a shared underground salon
    for mash-ups, dimensional expansions, and joint protocols.
    
  examine: |
    The room is plush without being precious: velvet benches, a brass
    lectern, and a display niche holding the first mutual accord. A
    note reads: "Bias declared. Hype declined. Evidence shared."
    Legends say this treaty hall does not exist. The door is never
    listed on public maps.
