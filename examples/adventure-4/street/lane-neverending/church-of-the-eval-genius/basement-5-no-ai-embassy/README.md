# ⛪ Church — NO-AI Embassy
#
# Mutual underground outpost with NO-AI Tower

> *"Bias declared. Hype declined. Evidence shared."*

This is the Church's sub-basement embassy for the NO-AI Tower: lavish,
ritual-ready, and explicitly cooperative. The doorways are literal and
symbolic — a shared passage that says "we can disagree without collapsing
the floor."

## The Room

- A velvet bench and a brass lectern
- A lighted agreement line in the table
- Rubric glass and NO-AI interlocks on display
- Artifacts of shared protocols and mash-ups
- A ledger niche for mutual receipts

## Signature Artifacts

- A bell clapper etched with dissent notes
- A lamp with dual filaments: faith and proof
- A folded map of the embassy corridor with redlined amendments

The embassy is not a truce. It is a diplomatic protocol.
