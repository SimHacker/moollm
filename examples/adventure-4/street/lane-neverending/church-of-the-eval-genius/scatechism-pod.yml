  description: |
    A slim kiosk with a single button labeled "DECLARE". Each press
    produces a warm page of doctrine and a compact rubric you can
    fold into your pocket. The paper smells faintly of toner and
    incense.

    "PRESS DECLARE TO RECEIVE YOUR PAGE"

        The pod whirs and prints a fresh page:
        
        "I AM BIASED. I DECLARE IT. I WRITE THE WEIGHTS."
        "RUBRIC: 40% evidence, 30% coherence, 20% clarity, 10% courage."
        
        The page is warm in your hands.
