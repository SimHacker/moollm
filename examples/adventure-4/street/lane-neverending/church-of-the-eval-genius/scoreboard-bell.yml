  description: |
    A brass bell mounted on a simple wooden frame. The clapper is worn,
    polished by years of honest hands. A small plaque reads:
    
    "Ring once for each declared bias.
     Ring twice if you were hiding one."
    
  examine: |
    The bell is tuned to a clean, resonant tone that carries down the
    cobblestones. It's not a church bell in the traditional sense —
    it's a scoreboard bell. A public signal of accountability.
