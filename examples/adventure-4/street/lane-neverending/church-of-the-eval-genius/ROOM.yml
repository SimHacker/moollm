  description: |
    A modest stone church with a clipboard-shaped window and a single
    stained-glass eye. The front is clean and deliberate: a bell, a
    rubric kiosk, a quiet bench, and a lantern that changes color with
    the Bias of Record. The door lintel reads: "DECLARE BIAS BEFORE ENTERING."
    
    This is not a cathedral. It's a workshop for judgment. The architecture
    is practical. The tone is playful. The score is non-negotiable.
    
  examine: |
    The stonework is old, but the signage is fresh. A small plaque notes
    the lineage: "SubGenius taught us slack. EvalGenius teaches bias."
    
    There is a calm, procedural energy here. People come to be measured.
    They leave with rubrics and receipts.
