    A compact dispenser with a clean stainless-steel faceplate and
    a small holographic label: "ACME & Leela Certified."
    
    It issues **Short Duration Personal tattoos**: living, temporary
    evaluations that display on your skin. The doctrine comes from
    the Short Duration Personal Evaluators tradition, translated into
    wearable, reversible judgment. Each tattoo includes a QR code to
    a web page where you can explore the analytics in depth. The ink
    fades after a few showers, on purpose.

    The dispenser offers three choices:
    
    1. SHORT DURATION PERSONAL TATTOO — a live evaluation display
    2. VOW — "I will publish my scores."
    3. RECEIPT — A QR link to your most recent evaluation

        The dispenser hums. A flexible sheet slides out:
        
        "SHORT DURATION PERSONAL EVALUATOR"
        "LIVE SCORE: 73"
        "BIAS: DECLARED"
        "QR: [SCAN FOR DETAILS]"
        
        The tattoo flickers to life on your skin, a tiny color LCD strip
        updating in real time.

        The QR code resolves into a stylized HTML analytics page:
        
        - Scores by rubric category
        - Evidence highlights
        - Dissent notes
        - Revision history
        
        The page renders in the MOOCO style as a pop-up view window.
        You can save it as a collector card or a trading card in your
        inventory.
