# 📋 The Narthex of Declared Bias

> "DECLARE BIAS BEFORE YOU SPEAK."

The entry hall of the [Church of the Eval Genius](../). Clean, bureaucratic, intentional. A long table with a sign-in ledger and a rack of laminated rubrics. Smells like pencil shavings and fresh paper.

A second sign: "IF IT'S NOT WRITTEN, IT DIDN'T HAPPEN."

## Exits
