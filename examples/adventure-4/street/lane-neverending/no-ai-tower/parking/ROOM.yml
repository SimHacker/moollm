    The parking lot behind NO AI TOWER.
    
    It's not so much a "lot" as "the space between the building
    and the fence." Three spaces. Freshly painted lines (they tried).

    The sign maintenance van is always here.
    (The sign needs a LOT of maintenance.)
    
  examine: |
    SPACE #1: EMPLOYEE PARKING
    Currently empty.
    A faded sign: "EMPLOYEE OF THE MONTH"
    (No name. There's been no employee of the month.)
    
    SPACE #2: EMPLOYEE PARKING
    A Prius with bumper stickers:
    - "NO AI™" (of course)
    - "I READ BANNED BOOKS"
    - "COEXIST" (but with programming languages)
    
    SPACE #3: RESERVED — SIGN MAINTENANCE
    Steve's van. White. Dented. Lettering on the side:
    "STEVE'S NEON & ELECTRIC — If It Glows, We Know"
    
    Steve is here A LOT.
    The sign needs constant attention.
    Bulbs. Transformers. Chasing lights.
    Steve is practically an employee at this point.
    
    THE DUMPSTER:
    Standard commercial dumpster.
    Contents: boxes, packaging materials, failed manifestos.
    Pickup: Thursdays.
    
    THE TRANSFORMER:
    The BIG one. The one that powers THE SIGN.
    Locked cabinet. "DANGER: HIGH VOLTAGE"
    Hums loudly. Costs a fortune.
    
    THE FENCE:
    Chain-link. 6 feet. Gate to the empty lot.
    The empty lot is... still empty.
    Still waiting for its future.
