    *DING* — BASEMENT 8: JOKING
    
    The elevator opens onto a CORPORATE TRAINING CENTER.
    
    Harsh fluorescent lighting. Beige walls. Motivational posters
    that aren't quite motivational. A podium. Rows of chairs.
    
    A banner stretches across the room:

    But wait — in the back corner, a different door:
    
        ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
        │    MINSKY MEMORIAL WING            │
        │    "The bug IS the feature"        │
        └─────────────────────────────────────┘
    
    Someone put the humor theory BEHIND the humor suppression.
    
  examine: |
    THE TRAINING CENTER:
    Corporate beige. Uncomfortable chairs (intentional).
    A whiteboard with "ENTERPRISE COMMUNICATION GUIDELINES"
    
    The Guidelines:
    1. Levity is inefficient
    2. Jokes require context (context is expensive)
    3. Humor may be misinterpreted (liability)
    4. Seriousness demonstrates competence
    5. If you must be funny, file form HC-7 first
    
    THE VIOLATION LOG:
    A filing cabinet labeled "HUMOR VIOLATIONS"
    It's EMPTY.
    A sign: "No violations logged. We do not make mistakes."
    
    (This IS the joke.)
    
    THE MINSKY MEMORIAL WING:
    Through the back door, a different space entirely:
    - Displays of Minsky's humor theory
    - Hacker Koans on the walls
    - The Ultimate Machine (working model!)
    - RMS stories in a listening booth
    
    A plaque:
    
        MARVIN MINSKY (1927-2016)
        "Humor is the aesthetic appreciation of cognitive bugs."
        
        This wing exists because:
        - The skill suppresses humor
        - The suppression IS funny
        - The funniness demonstrates Minsky's mechanism
        - THE BUG IS THE FEATURE
        
  atmosphere: |
    In the training center: oppressive corporate energy.
    In the Minsky wing: warm appreciation of absurdity.
    
    The contrast IS the point.
    
    NO-AI-JOKING™ is a SKILL that catches itself failing
    and becomes funnier instead of useless.
