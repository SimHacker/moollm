      The sign BUZZES. Constantly. A warm electrical hum that says

         ╰─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
    
    Forty feet of vintage neon and incandescent glory towering over a
    narrow storefront that looks like it used to be a shoe repair shop.
    The sign is MAGNIFICENT. The building is... humble.
    
    The windows have NEWSPAPER taped up from the inside.
    Headlines visible in reverse: "AI THREATENS JOBS"... "CHATBOT GOES WRONG"...
    "ELON MUSK WARNS"... You can't see inside.
    
    A hand-lettered sign on the door: "OPEN BY APPOINTMENT"
    A smaller sign below: "Appointments not currently available."
    
    The door is LOCKED but it looks like the kind of lock that opens
    if you jiggle the handle right and push with your shoulder.
    
    The sign BUZZES and FLICKERS. One bulb in the "O" is dead.
    A few chasing lights are stuck in the ON position.
    At night, you can see it from three blocks away.
    
    Next door, Leela Manufacturing rises three stories with its dignified
    signage. They've probably complained about the buzzing. More than once.
    
  examine: |
    THE BUILDING:
    One story. Maybe 800 square feet. Former shoe repair? Dry cleaner?
    The kind of cheap commercial space that gentrification forgot.
    
    The door says "NO AI TOWER — WORLD HEADQUARTERS"
    The door is locked. The lights are off.
    
    THE WINDOWS:
    Newspaper taped up inside. Yellowing. Headlines facing in:
    • "AI System Makes Embarrassing Error"
    • "Tech Giants Face Backlash Over..."
    • "Study Shows ChatGPT Gets Basic Facts..."
    • "Experts Warn: Artificial Intelligence..."
    
    Wait — are those CURATED? Someone selected these headlines.
    The taping pattern is too deliberate to be random.
    
    THE SIGN:
    40 feet tall. Hot pink and gold neon with teal chasing lights.
    Old Las Vegas casino aesthetic — like the Stardust or the Sands
    if they'd been built by someone with OPINIONS about large language models.
    
    Starbursts. Arrows. A giant robot-prohibition symbol.
    Animation sequence every 8 seconds. Buzzing hum at 60Hz.
    
    The transformer box behind the building is SUBSTANTIAL.
    Someone is paying a SIGNIFICANT electricity bill to run this thing.
    
    THE CONTRAST:
    This one-story newspaper-windowed storefront has a sign that
    would make Caesar's Palace say "bit much, don't you think?"
    
    TRUMP TOWER has a sign proportionate to its building.
    NO AI TOWER has inverted that relationship entirely.
    
    THE NEIGHBORS:
    To the east: Leela Manufacturing Intelligence (3 stories, dignified)
    To the west: Empty lot (gravel, weeds, dreams of development)
    Across: The continuation of ACME Surplus's failure
    
    You can FEEL Leela's cameras watching this building.
    The irony is palpable.
    
  # The cheap commercial district vibe
  neighborhood:
    character: "Low-income commercial, pre-gentrification holdout"
    rent: "Suspiciously cheap"
    previous_tenant: "Sal's Shoe Repair (RIP 2024)"
    foot_traffic: "minimal"
    parking: "on-street only"
    
    nearby:
      east: "Leela Manufacturing Intelligence (thriving)"
      west: "Empty lot (ambitious signage, no building)"
      north: "ACME Surplus overflow storage (abandoned)"
      
    observation: |
      NO AI TOWER occupies the exact kind of space that gets
      absorbed into Leela's expansion plans eventually.
      
      For now, it persists. Buzzing. Flickering. Making a STATEMENT.
    
  # What's INSIDE (if you ever get in)
  interior_hints:
    visible_through_newspaper_gaps:
      - "Folding chairs (a few)"
      - "A desk? Maybe?"
      - "Boxes with NO AI bumper stickers"
      - "A corkboard with... something pinned to it"
      - "What might be a coffee maker"
      
    smell_through_door_crack: "old carpet, printer toner, righteousness"
    
    sounds_from_inside: "Nothing. Complete silence."
    
    mystery: |
      Is anyone actually here? Does NO AI TOWER have EMPLOYEES?
      Or is it just a sign, a manifesto, and a locked door?
      
      The electricity bill for the sign suggests SOMEONE is paying attention.

      This is the physical manifestation of NO-AI-IDEOLOGY™:

      - "Chasing lights occasionally spell out words (coincidence?)"

  relationship_to_leela: |
    NO AI TOWER exists next door to Leela Manufacturing Intelligence.
    
    Leela MANUFACTURES INTELLIGENCE. With AI. Successfully.
    NO AI TOWER... opposes this? Satirizes this? Comments on this?
    
    The joke is:
    1. The anti-AI headquarters is NEXT DOOR to an AI company
    2. The anti-AI SIGN requires significant technology to operate
    3. The "tower" is one story
    4. The sign is more impressive than most actual towers
    5. Both entities coexist on the same electrical grid
    
  the_deeper_joke: |
    NO AI TOWER is, itself, a NO-AI™ product.
    
    It's simultaneously:
    - A sincere critique of AI hype
    - A parody of anti-technology movements
    - A commentary on performative opposition
    - A really good sign
    
    The building doesn't matter. The STATEMENT matters.
    And sometimes the statement is a 40-foot neon sign
    that costs more to run than the rent.
    
  the_colossal_precedent: |
    In 1976, Drew Takahashi and Gary Gutierrez — two guys who'd been
    doing animated shorts for a kids' show — started a company.
    
    They called it COLOSSAL PICTURES.
    
    Not "Drew and Gary's Animation." Not "Bay Area Motion Graphics."
    COLOSSAL. PICTURES.
    
    They became exactly what the name promised: MTV IDs, Levi's
    commercials, represented Pixar, the works.
    
    The audacious name is a self-fulfilling prophecy.
    Fake it till you make it.
    Or in NO AI TOWER's case: sign it till you mean it.
    
  minsky_connection: |
    Per Minsky's theory of cognitive humor:
    
    Bug detected: "Tower" should mean tall building
    Recognition: This is one story with a giant sign
    Appreciation: The disproportion IS the point
    Laughter: At the audacity of calling this a "tower"
    
    THE BUG IS THE FEATURE.
