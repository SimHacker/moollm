# 📦 NO AI TOWER — Loading Dock

It's a door. A single door. With a hand truck leaning against it.

## The Contrast

| Leela Manufacturing | NO AI TOWER |
|---------------------|-------------|
| Eight bays — four in, four out | One door |
| Every package annotated | A clipboard (sometimes) |
| Forklifts tracked in real-time | Hand truck, manual |
| Choreographed logistics ballet | Steve, when he's around |

## Philosophy

```yaml
anti_leela:
  leela_tracks: "Every package annotated, every forklift tracked"
  we_track: "A clipboard. Sometimes."
  
  insight: |
    Leela ships THINGS.
    We ship IDEAS.
    
    Ideas fit through a single door.
    (Most of the time.)
```

## What Gets Shipped

- Bumper sticker orders (small boxes)
- Returned merchandise (same small boxes)
- Occasional pallets of manifestos
- Steve's personal mail (he uses the business address)

## Navigation

| Exit | Destination | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `inside` | Lobby | Through the back hallway |
| `alley` | Back alley | Out back |
| `logistics` | Logistics | The closet with a laptop |
| `parking` | Parking lot | Three spaces |
| `leela_docks` | Leela's docks | 150 feet east (if you want to feel inadequate) |
