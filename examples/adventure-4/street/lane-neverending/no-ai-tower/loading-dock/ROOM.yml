# Leela has EIGHT loading bays.
# NO AI Tower has ONE.
# And it's really more of a back door with a hand truck.

    The back of NO AI TOWER opens onto a narrow alley.
    
    This is the "loading dock."
    It's a door. A single door. With a hand truck leaning against it.

    A sign on the door:
    "RECEIVING & SHIPPING HOURS: BY ARRANGEMENT"
    
    Leela Manufacturing's eight-bay dock complex is visible
    150 feet to the east. The contrast is... instructive.
    
  examine: |
    THE DOOR:
    Steel. Industrial. Squeaks when opened.
    A sign: "PLEASE RING BELL FOR SERVICE"
    (There is no bell.)
    
    THE HAND TRUCK:
    Two-wheeler. Faded "ACME" logo scratched into the handle.
    Did they buy it? Borrow it? Steal it?
    It works. That's what matters.
    
    THE SHIPPING AREA:
    A 6x8 foot concrete pad.
    - Stack of flat-pack boxes (ready for bumper stickers)
    - Roll of packing tape
    - Sharpie (for labeling)
    - Scale (postal)
    - Stamps (lots of stamps)

    THE VIEW:
    From here you can see Leela's loading operation.
    Forklifts. Pallets. Coordinated activity.
    Trucks constantly arriving and departing.
    
    Then there's... this door.
    
  philosophy: |
    Leela MANUFACTURES at scale.
    NO AI TOWER manufactures... IDEAS.
    
    Ideas don't need eight loading bays.
    Ideas need: one door, a hand truck, and stamps.
    
    The real product is digital anyway.
    This loading dock ships ARTIFACTS.
    The artifacts are not the point.
    
    (But the bumper stickers are nice.)
