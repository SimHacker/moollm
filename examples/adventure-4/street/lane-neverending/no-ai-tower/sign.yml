  # Sound profile
  sound:
    constant: |
      A 60Hz electrical hum. Warm. Buzzy. The sound of COMMITMENT.
      Audible from the pub on quiet nights.
      
    intermittent:
      - "CHUNK when relays switch (every 8 seconds)"
      - "Crackle when moisture in the air"
      - "Occasional POP when a bulb gives up"
      - "ZZZzzap when the 'I' flickers"
      
    neighbors_complaints: "documented"
    
  # History and lore
  history:
    commission_date: "2026-03-15"
    installation_date: "2026-04-01" # not a coincidence
    cost: "Nobody will say, but it was a LOT"
    designer: "Allegedly a retired Vegas sign maker"
    
    backstory: |
      When NO AI TOWER took over the old shoe repair shop,
      the first and ONLY renovation was THE SIGN.
      
      The building still has Sal's Shoe Repair's old floor tiles.
      But THE SIGN? Custom designed. Professionally installed.
      Permitted (barely). Inspected (eventually).
      
      The neighbors petitioned. The sign stayed.
      The city complained. The sign stayed.
      Leela offered to buy the property. The sign stayed.
      
      The sign is the statement.
      The building is just what holds it up.
      
  # The deeper meaning
  symbolism:
    primary: "All resources into the message, not the infrastructure"
    secondary: "Anti-AI sentiment expressed through impressive technology"
    tertiary: "TRUMP TOWER parody (audacity over substance)"
    quaternary: "Desert highway optimism meets tech skepticism"
    
    irony_layers:
      - "The sign requires significant tech to operate"
      - "It's powered by the same grid as an AI company"
      - "Vegas signs celebrated THE FUTURE; this one mourns it"
      - "The sign IS impressive; the 'tower' is one story"
      
  # Interaction
  examine_close: |
    Up close, you can see:
    - The welds on the support structure (solid work)
    - The transformer box (humming industriously)
    - The timer mechanism (analog, not digital — of course)
    - Dead bulbs waiting for replacement
    - Wasp nests in two of the starbursts
    - A small plaque: "Fabricated by Desert Neon Classics, Reno NV"
    
  examine_from_afar: |
    From the pub, you can see THE SIGN clearly.
    It dominates the western skyline of Lane Neverending.
    
    At night, it outshines Leela Manufacturing's dignified facade.
    The contrast is... pointed.
    
  rumors:
    - "The sign predates the building (impossible but widely believed)"
    - "The dead bulb in the O is INTENTIONAL"
    - "It spells out messages if you watch long enough"
    - "Leela's cameras are analyzing the flicker patterns"
    - "Someone inside NO AI TOWER controls it manually"
    - "It once saved a ship from running aground (wrong tower)"

  personality: |
    THE SIGN is not sentient. Probably.
    
    But it has... presence. Character.
    Forty years of Vegas sign-making tradition poured into
    a statement about artificial intelligence.
    
    It doesn't think.
    But it MEANS something.
    And meaning, in LLOOOOMM, is halfway to awareness.
