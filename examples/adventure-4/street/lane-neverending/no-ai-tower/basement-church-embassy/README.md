# 🏢 NO-AI Tower — Church Embassy
#
# Mutual underground outpost with the Church of the Eval Genius

> *"We keep the boundaries. We share the receipts."*

The lowest NO-AI sub-basement hosts a lavish embassy dedicated to the Church.
It exists for one purpose: keep the discourse sharp without boiling the water.

## The Room

- A circular table with a live rubric dial
- Cedar shelves of curated proof
- Brass rails and lacquered wood
- A sign: "Mutual Embassies — respect the boundary"
- A wall clock that ticks only during review

## Resident Objects

- A seal press labeled "non‑gloss compliant"
- A red ribbon for contested claims
- A ledger of shared tests and their outcomes

This is not a compromise. It's a coordination channel.
