  name: "NO-AI Tower — Church Embassy"
  type: embassy
  
  description: |
    The last sub-basement of NO-AI Tower, quiet by intention, lavish
    by design. The room glows with soft amber light, reflecting off
    brass rails and lacquered wood. A circular table holds a live
    rubric dial, a NO-AI oath scroll, and a shared evidence ledger.
    
    This is the NO-AI outpost inside the Church network — a ceremonial
    workshop for joint constraints, mash-ups, and dimensional diplomacy.

    The air hums faintly with transformer noise from above, but the
    walls are thick and warm. The sign reads:
    "Mutual Embassies — respect the boundary, share the evidence."
    The sub-basement is a legend inside the tower, a rumor traded in
    back channels, never posted on the public directory.
