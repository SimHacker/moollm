    You emerge onto the roof of NO AI TOWER.
    
    The sun is BRIGHT after the dim interior.
    The wind is REAL after the recycled basement air.
    And THE SIGN is RIGHT THERE.
    
    From behind, you can see the MECHANISM:
    - Transformer boxes (SUBSTANTIAL)
    - Wiring (EXPOSED in places)
    - Control boxes (ANALOG, with dials)
    - A maintenance ladder (DO NOT CLIMB)
    
    The sign BUZZES. Not the muffled hum from inside.
    The FULL 60Hz electrical symphony.
    
    You can see Leela Manufacturing from here.
    Three stories of dignified industrial architecture.
    Their cameras can definitely see YOU.
    
    Wave?
    
  examine: |
    THE ROOF:
    Flat. Tarred. A few folding lawn chairs.
    Someone comes up here. There's a cooler (empty).
    
    THE SIGN (FROM BEHIND):
    Magnificent in its engineering.
    - 40 feet of steel frame
    - Miles of neon tubing
    - Hundreds of incandescent bulbs
    - Chase light controllers (some stuck)
    - Main transformer: 480V, serious amperage
    
    The dead bulb in the "O" is accessible from here.
    Someone could fix it. No one has.
    
    THE VIEW:
    - EAST: Leela Manufacturing (watching you)
    - WEST: Empty lot (nothing watching)
    - NORTH: ACME Surplus (broken windows watching)
    - SOUTH: Lane Neverending (pedestrians not watching)
    
    THE SOUND:
    The sign doesn't just buzz. It SINGS.
    A chorus of electrical components at 60Hz.
    Almost musical. Definitely constant.
    
  atmosphere: |
    Up here, you understand the AUDACITY.
    
    This one-story building has a 40-foot sign.
    This budget operation pays SIGNIFICANT power bills.
    This satirical enterprise makes a STATEMENT.
    
    The sign is not compensating.
    The sign is PERFORMING.
    
    And from up here, you can see:
    - The tower goes underground
    - The surface is a front
    - The sign is the MESSAGE
    
    Like Colossal Pictures: the name creates the reality.

      Steve uses this 3x a week to work on the sign.

      You could climb ON the sign.
      You probably shouldn't.
      But you could.
