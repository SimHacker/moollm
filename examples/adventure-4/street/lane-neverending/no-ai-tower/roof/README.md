# ☀️ NO AI TOWER — Roof

You emerge into the sunlight.

## The Sign

**THE SIGN is RIGHT THERE.**

Three stories of neon tubing spelling "NO AI" in letters you could see from the highway. Buzzing. Humming. One bulb in the "O" is dead (or maybe just resting).

## The View

From up here you can see:
- **East**: Leela Manufacturing (looming, professional, humming with purpose)
- **West**: The empty lot (still dreaming)
- **North**: Lane Neverending stretching toward the highway
- **South**: The backs of buildings, fire escapes, air conditioning units

## The Contrast

The sign is THREE STORIES tall.
The building is ONE STORY tall.
The underground is ELEVEN FLOORS deep.

The sign isn't compensating.
The sign is a **STATEMENT**.

## Atmosphere
