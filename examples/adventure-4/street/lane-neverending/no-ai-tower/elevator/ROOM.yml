# VEHICLE SEMANTICS — LEXICAL vs DYNAMIC LOCATION

# The elevator is a VEHICLE, not just a room.

# DYNAMIC LOCATION: The elevator can "move" to any floor.

#                   When you're IN the elevator, YOU move with it.
#
# Like a CLOSURE in programming:
#   - Lexical scope = where the function is DEFINED
#   - Dynamic scope = where the function is CALLED FROM
#
# The elevator's physical file is here.
# The elevator's runtime location is wherever it stopped last.

        The original "building goes DOWN" inspiration.
        A skyscraper simulation where the ELEVATOR SYSTEM is the game.
        Lobby at ground level, most floors underground.
        The elevator doesn't just move people — it IS the building.

        Moves VERTICALLY and HORIZONTALLY through the ship.
        The turbolift doesn't just go up/down — it navigates a 3D maze.
        Conversations happen in turbolifts. Dramatic pauses. Tension.

        BIGGER ON THE INSIDE.
        Travels through TIME and SPACE, not just floors.
        The destination isn't always where you intended.
        Sometimes the TARDIS takes you where you NEED to go.
        
        Our elevator: "You pressed -9 but ended up at -10. The elevator
        knows you need to confront your inner overlord first."

        Goes UP, DOWN, SIDEWAYS, SLANTWAYS, and any other way you can think of.
        Burst through the roof. Went to SPACE.
        Made of glass so you can see EVERYTHING.

        Glass walls. Sees everything. Goes everywhere in the factory.
        The factory is the building. The building is the factory.
        
        NO AI TOWER: The skill floors ARE the factory.
        The products are manufactured on each floor.
        The elevator visits the production lines.

      Roald Dahl understood:
      
      The building isn't the point.
      The ELEVATOR is the point.
      The journey between floors is where the magic happens.
      
      Our elevator has muzak and wood paneling, not glass walls.
      But the PRINCIPLE is the same: the ride IS the experience.

        Your elevator can connect rooms across your entire adventure.
        The elevator becomes a PORTAL.

    THE ELEVATOR IS A PATTERN, NOT JUST A ROOM.
    
    You're not buying an elevator.
    You're buying a RELATIONSHIP between spaces.
    
    The shaft doesn't have to be vertical.
    The floors don't have to be physical.
    The destinations don't have to be adjacent.
    
    The elevator is just a vehicle with:
    - A fixed set of destinations (valid_floors)
    - A current location (dynamic)
    - A home location (lexical)
    - A personality (style, muzak, sound effects)
    
    What you DO with that is up to you.
