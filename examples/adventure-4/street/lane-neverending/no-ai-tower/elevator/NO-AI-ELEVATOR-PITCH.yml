# THE PITCH (You have 30 seconds)

elevator_pitch: |
  
  *DING* — You step into my elevator.
  
  "Nice place you got here. One room, right? Maybe two?"
  
  *The doors close.*
  
  "What if I told you that room could go UP? And DOWN?
   What if that closet became a PENTHOUSE?
   What if that basement became a DUNGEON?
   What if your CEILING became someone else's FLOOR?"
  
  *I press a button. We descend.*
  
  "You're not buying an elevator.
   You're buying VERTICAL REAL ESTATE.
   You're buying POSSIBILITIES.
   You're buying a RELATIONSHIP between spaces."
  
  *DING* — We arrive. Somewhere unexpected.
  
  "One room? No. You have INFINITE rooms.
   You just couldn't REACH them before."
  
  *The doors open.*
  
  "So... interested?"

# FINE PRINT

fine_print: |
  * NO-AI-ELEVATOR™ is provided "as is" under WTFPL / Public Domain.
  * Installation requires understanding of YAML and directory structures.
  * Vertical expansion may cause existential questions about "up" and "down."
  * TARDIS mode may deliver you somewhere unexpected. This is intentional.
  * NO AI TOWER is not responsible for:
    - Conversations that happen while stuck between floors
    - Muzak-induced earworms
    - Discovering what's REALLY in your basement
    - The void
  * The cake is a lie, but the elevator is real.
  
  "An elevator can only go up and down, but this is not an elevator!"
