# 🛗 NO-AI-ELEVATOR™

> *"An elevator pitch... FOR an elevator!"*

---

## EXPAND YOUR ROOM — UP AND DOWN!

Why settle for one floor when you could have **TWELVE**?  
Why walk when you could **RIDE**?  
Why be limited by **GRAVITY** when you could transcend it?

---

## The Pitch (You have 30 seconds)

*DING* — You step into my elevator.

"Nice place you got here. One room, right? Maybe two?"

*The doors close.*

"What if I told you that room could go **UP**? And **DOWN**?  
What if that closet became a **PENTHOUSE**?  
What if that basement became a **DUNGEON**?  
What if your **CEILING** became someone else's **FLOOR**?"

*I press a button. We descend.*

"You're not buying an elevator.  
You're buying **VERTICAL REAL ESTATE**.  
You're buying **POSSIBILITIES**.  
You're buying a **RELATIONSHIP** between spaces."

*DING* — We arrive. Somewhere unexpected.

"One room? No. You have **INFINITE** rooms.  
You just couldn't **REACH** them before."

*The doors open.*

"So... interested?"

## ✨ Features

### Vehicle Semantics
Your elevator is a **VEHICLE**, not just a room.

- **LEXICAL HOME**: Where the elevator file lives (its definition)
- **DYNAMIC LOCATION**: Where the elevator currently IS (changes!)

*Like a closure in programming. Like a TARDIS in space.*

### The Lineage
Your elevator inherits from the GREATS:

- **SimTower** (1994) — The building goes DOWN
- **Turbolift** (Star Trek) — Voice control, horizontal movement
- **TARDIS** (Doctor Who) — Bigger on the inside, goes anywhere
- **Great Glass Elevator** (Roald Dahl) — Up, down, sideways, SPACE

### Sound Design
```
*CLANG* — The brass gate slides shut
*WHIRRRR* — The machinery engages  
*hummmmm* — Muzak plays softly
*DING* — You've arrived
*CLATTER* — The gate opens
```

### Easter Eggs
- **ALL BUTTONS AT ONCE**: Tower Overdrive mode
- **KONAMI CODE**: Secret floor -12 appears (THE VOID)
- **STUCK BETWEEN FLOORS**: Dramatic conversation opportunity
