    *DING* — BASEMENT 1: IDEOLOGY
    
    The elevator opens onto THE WAREHOUSE.
    
    Rows of industrial shelving stretch into the distance.
    Labeled boxes. Filing cabinets. Archive crates.
    The collected PHILOSOPHY of NO-AI™.

    The ceiling is LOW. The lighting is HARSH.
    This is a working space, not a showroom.

    THE SHELVING:
    Industrial metal. Institutional beige.
    Each shelf is labeled:
    
    AISLE 1: BRAND
    - Box: "BRAND.md — The Full Manifesto"
    - Box: "Naming Conventions (The Jokes)"
    - Box: "NO-AI™ Product Line"
    
    AISLE 2: PHILOSOPHY
    - Box: "Žižek — Cynical Distance Won't Save You"
    - Box: "McLuhan — The Medium Is The Message"
    - Box: "WPS — World Power Systems Heritage"
    - Box: "Church of the SubGenius — Slack → Bias"
    
    AISLE 3: CHARTER
    - Box: "CHARTER.yml — Data Storage Principles"
    - Box: "Privacy by Default"
    - Box: "Sharing by Choice"
    
    AISLE 4: INHERITANCE
    - Box: "Church of Eval Genius"
    - Box: "ACME Corporation"
    - Box: "The Yes Men"
    
    THE PARADOX (on the wall):
    
        PROMISE: "Remove ideology from AI"
        DELIVERY: "This skill IS the ideology"
        
        You're standing in it.
        
  atmosphere: |
    The warehouse hums with meaning.
    Every box contains CHOICES.
    Every label is a POSITION.
    
    This is where the philosophy is STORED,
    but it's also where the philosophy LIVES.
    
    The lighting is harsh because truth is harsh.
    The ceiling is low because depth requires humility.
    
    From here, stairs lead DOWN to the other departments.
    Each one a different aspect of the same ideology.
