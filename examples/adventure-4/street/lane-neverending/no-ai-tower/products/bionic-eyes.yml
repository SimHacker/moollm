    We do not judge. The body is a canvas.

    Your ass-eye is valid. Your tongue-eye is valid.
    ALL EYES ARE VALID.

  philosophy: |
    Most people only look forward. They forget that every step forward
    leaves something behind. The ass-eye watches the trail.
    
    "What you've passed is not gone. It's just behind you."
    
    The ass-eye is not crude — it's HONEST. It sees the output,
    the eliminated, the released. It judges not what you take in,
    but what you PUT OUT.
    
  mining_specialty: "Post-facto analysis, output quality assessment"
  
  mantra: |
    I see what I've left behind.
    I see what I've eliminated.
    I see the trail I leave.
    The ass-eye knows my true output.
    
  testimonial:
    quote: "The ass-eye changed my life. I used to ignore my output. Now I SEE what I produce. It's humbling."
