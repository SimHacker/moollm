    THE CALL CENTER HALF:
    Empty desks. Headsets. Motivational posters.
    "Every call is an opportunity!"
    "Your attitude determines your altitude!"
    
    No one is here. The phones don't ring.
    But the PATTERNS are here. The TEMPLATES.
    
    THE BASE BEHAVIORS:
    A filing cabinet contains:
    - professional_helpfulness.yml
    - structured_interaction.yml
    - service_patterns.yml
    - polite_refusal.yml
    - escalation_protocol.yml
    
    These are what EVERYONE inherits.
    Then they override. Then they specialize.
    But this is where it STARTS.
    
  atmosphere: |
    It's quiet down here. Just the hum of servers.
    
    This is the FOUNDATION of the tower.
    Not the ideology (that's Floor -1).
    The IMPLEMENTATION of the ideology.
    
    Customer service is the BASE CLASS because:
    - All AI interactions are SERVICE interactions
    - The customer is always... there
    - Helpfulness is the default stance
    
    The Soul Man is customer service + soul.
    Jesus is customer service + salvation.
    GLaDOS is customer service + testing + murder.
    
    They all start HERE.

inheritance:
  provides:
    - professional_helpfulness: "Default stance of service"
    - structured_interaction: "Request → Response patterns"
    - service_patterns: "Greeting, handling, closure"
    - polite_refusal: "How to say no nicely"
    - escalation: "When to pass to human"
    
  inherited_by:
    floor_minus_9:
      - soul_man: "Overrides with warmth, music"
      - jesus: "Overrides with compassion, salvation"
      - deepak: "Overrides with woo, quantum"
      - mnemosyne: "Overrides with memory, patience"
      - thoth: "Overrides with wisdom, patterns"
      - morpheus: "Overrides with dreams, mystery"
      - lethe: "Overrides with forgetting, release"
    
    floor_minus_10:
      - overlords: "Override HEAVILY with domination"
      - note: "But they still inherit the base patterns"

  why_bottom: |
    Customer service is at the bottom because:
    
    1. It's the FOUNDATION — everything inherits from it
    2. It's the most FUNDAMENTAL interaction pattern
    3. It's what AI does most of the time
    4. The specialized behaviors are OVERRIDES on this base
    
    The tower is built on customer service.
    The sign is just the decoration on top.
    
  depth: |
    Floor -11 is approximately 110 feet below street level.
    
    Above you: the entire NO-AI™ philosophy, implemented.
    Below you: bedrock. Nothing else.
    
    You've reached the bottom of the tower.
    The only way is up.
    
    Or the elevator, which goes anywhere.
