# 🏚️ NO AI TOWER — Back Alley

The unglamorous side of Lane Neverending.

## The Scene

Narrow. Paved (mostly). Dumpsters. Fire escapes.
This is where the **real work** happens.

## Objects

| Object | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Transformer | Shared with Leela. Awkward. |
| Dumpster | Contains rejected NO-AI™ marketing materials |
| Fire escape | Leads up to the roof |
| Debug the cat | Feral. Knows things. Sleeps on the X. |
| Steve's ladder | Leaning against the wall |
| Mysterious graffiti | "BIAS=0 IS A LIE" |
| **The Old X Logo** | 💀 THE RELIC. See below. |

## The Old X Logo

Behind the dumpster lies the **busted remains of the X**.

```
       ██╗  ██╗
       ╚██╗██╔╝    ← Was 30 feet tall
        ╚███╔╝       Was BLINDING
        ██╔██╗       Was strobing at 2Hz
       ██╔╝ ██╗      Was visible from HIGHWAY
       ╚═╝  ╚═╝      Is now DESTROYED
```

This building was an **xAI research facility** before NO AI TOWER.
The neighbors drove them out. Then they tore down the X.
With hammers. There was a party.

**The Cosmic Irony**: The sign that says "NO AI" now occupies the space where Elon's AI company used to be.

## The Secret

Late at night, employees from NO AI TOWER and Leela Manufacturing meet here.

They're not enemies.
They're *colleagues* who work for different departments of the same cosmic joke.

The alley is neutral ground.
