# 🏚️ NO AI TOWER — Back Alley

The unglamorous side of Lane Neverending.

## The Scene

Narrow. Paved (mostly). Dumpsters. Fire escapes.
This is where the **real work** happens.

## Objects

| Object | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Transformer | Shared with Leela. Awkward. |
| Dumpster | Contains rejected NO-AI™ marketing materials |
| Fire escape | Leads up to the roof |
| Debug the cat | Feral. Knows things. |
| Steve's ladder | Leaning against the wall |
| Mysterious graffiti | "BIAS=0 IS A LIE" |

## The Secret

Late at night, employees from NO AI TOWER and Leela Manufacturing meet here.

They're not enemies.
They're *colleagues* who work for different departments of the same cosmic joke.

The alley is neutral ground.
