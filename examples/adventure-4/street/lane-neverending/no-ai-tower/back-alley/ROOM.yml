    The back alley behind NO AI TOWER.
    
    Narrow. Paved (mostly). Dumpsters. Fire escapes.
    The unglamorous side of Lane Neverending.

    Above you, THE SIGN buzzes and flickers.
    From back here, you can see the wiring.
    
  examine: |
    THE ALLEY:
    About 15 feet wide. Asphalt, cracked in places.
    Street lights at each end. Dark in the middle.
    
    LEELA'S BACK WALL (east side):
    Clean brick. Security cameras (watching you helpfully).
    Fire escape. Climate control vents. Professional.
    A small sign: "LEELA MANUFACTURING — SERVICE ENTRANCE →"
    
    NO AI TOWER'S BACK (west side):
    The loading dock door. The parking spaces.
    The transformer cabinet (humming).
    The dumpster. The fire escape to the roof.
    
    THE SIGN FROM BELOW:
    From here, you can see the BACK of THE SIGN.
    The steel frame. The wiring. The junction boxes.
    It's less magical from this angle.
    But you can see how much WORK it takes.
    
    Steve's ladder is propped against the building.
    (Steve is always working on the sign.)
    
    THE ATMOSPHERE:
    This is where smoke breaks happen.
    Where delivery drivers wait.
    Where neighbors meet accidentally.
    
    Someone from Leela and someone from NO AI Tower
    probably have coffee together back here sometimes.
    
  secrets:
    graffiti:
      location: "On the dumpster"
      text: "AI = Always Insufficient"
      response: "Below it, in different handwriting: 'or: Actually Impressive?'"
      
    stray_cat:
      name: "Probably 'Debug'"
      description: "Orange tabby. Hangs out near the dumpster."
      allegiance: "Unclear. Gets fed by both buildings."
      
    late_night_meetings:
      description: |
        Sometimes, very late at night, people from both buildings
        meet in the alley to talk. Off the record.
        The ideological divide is narrower than the signs suggest.
        
  atmosphere: |
    Back alleys are liminal spaces.
    Neither inside nor outside. Neither public nor private.
    
    The front of NO AI TOWER is PERFORMANCE.
    The back is where the work happens.
    
    The sign buzzes overhead.
    The transformer hums.
    Debug the cat yawns.
    
    This is the real NO AI TOWER.
