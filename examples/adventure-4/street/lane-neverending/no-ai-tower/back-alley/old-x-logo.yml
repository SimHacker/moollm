  history: |
    This building wasn't always NO AI TOWER.
    
    Before the neon "NO AI" sign, there was an X.
    A GIGANTIC X.

    This was the Lane Neverending branch of xAI.
    Elon's people. Grok's birthplace (maybe).
    
    The neighbors... did not approve.
    
  the_revolt: |
    THE NEIGHBORS REVOLT (2024-2025)
    
    The X logo was not subtle:
    - 30 feet of blinding LED strips
    - Strobe effect at night (technically legal, ethically questionable)
    - Brightness: "Landing strip at midnight"
    - Frequency: 2Hz blink (clinically aggressive)
    
    The complaints:
    - "I can see it through my blackout curtains"
    - "My kids think it's an emergency signal"
    - "My dog has developed anxiety"
    - "It's visible from the HIGHWAY"
    
    The city got involved.
    Then the state got involved.
    Then Elon got bored and moved operations elsewhere.
    
    When they left, the neighbors TORE DOWN THE X.
    Ceremonially. With hammers. There was a party.
    
    The pieces ended up... here. Behind the dumpster.
    
  why_its_here: |
    NO AI TOWER bought this building BECAUSE of the X incident.
    
    The rent was cheap (reputation damage).
    The electrical infrastructure was ROBUST (built for the X).
    The neighbors were primed to accept ANYTHING less obnoxious.
    
    The "NO AI" sign is bright.
    The "NO AI" sign hums.
    But the "NO AI" sign does NOT:
    - Strobe
    - Blink at 2Hz
    - Resemble a landing strip
    - Trigger seizures
    - Visible from the highway
    
    The neighbors grumble about the neon sign.
    But they REMEMBER THE X.
    
    "At least it's not that goddamn X."
    
  current_state: |
    The X logo lies on its side behind the dumpster.
    
    - LED strips: Shattered (hammers)
    - Frame: Bent (ceremony)
    - Power cables: Cut (with feeling)
    - Control box: Smashed (catharsis)
    
    Someone spray-painted "GOOD RIDDANCE" on it.
    Someone else added "GROK WAS HERE" in smaller letters.
    Debug the cat sometimes sleeps on it.
    
  examine: |
    You approach the busted X logo.
    
    Even destroyed, it's IMPRESSIVE.
    The scale. The engineering. The hubris.
    
    The LED strips were DENSE — thousands of individual LEDs.
    The frame is aircraft-grade aluminum.
    The power supply could have run a small factory.
    
    All of it, now lying in an alley.
    Covered in spray paint and cat hair.
    
    There's a plaque still attached:

    Someone crossed out "Understanding" and wrote "Annoying."
    
  irony: |
    THE IRONY:
    
    xAI was driven out by complaints about their sign.
    NO AI TOWER bought the building.
    NO AI TOWER put up a different giant sign.
    
    The sign that says "NO AI" now occupies the space
    where Elon's AI company used to be.
    
    The universe has a sense of humor.
    Minsky would appreciate this.
    
actions:
  EXAMINE:
    effect: "Detailed inspection of the X wreckage"
    
  KICK:
    effect: |
      You kick the X.
      It makes a hollow metallic sound.
      Satisfying.
      Debug the cat glares at you.
      
  SALVAGE:
    effect: |
      The LEDs are shattered, but the power supply might work.
      The aluminum frame has scrap value.
      Do you really want xAI parts in your project?
      
  PHOTOGRAPH:
    effect: |
      You take a photo of the destroyed X.
