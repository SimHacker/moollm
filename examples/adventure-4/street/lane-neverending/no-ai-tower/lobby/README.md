# 🏢 NO AI TOWER — Lobby (Floor 0)

The ground floor of NO AI TOWER. It's... smaller than you expected.

## What You See

- Folding chairs
- A desk with bumper stickers
- A coffee maker (you glimpsed it through the window)
- **AN ELEVATOR** — the kind you'd see in a 1950s factory

## The Elevator

```
┌─────────────────────┐

```

The button panel goes from R to -11. **THAT'S** where the square footage went.

## Navigation

| Exit | Destination | Description |

## The Revelation

The sign outside isn't compensating.
The sign is a **DISTRACTION**.

The real NO AI TOWER is underground.
