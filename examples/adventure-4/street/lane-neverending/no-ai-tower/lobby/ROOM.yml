    You're inside NO AI TOWER.
    
    It's... smaller than you expected. The one-story storefront really
    IS just one story above ground. Folding chairs. A desk. Boxes of
    bumper stickers. The coffee maker you glimpsed through the window.
    
    But in the back corner, there's an ELEVATOR.
    
    A big industrial freight elevator with a manual gate.
    The kind you'd see in a 1950s factory.
    The button panel goes from R (roof) to -11 (what?).
    
    THAT'S where the square footage went.
    
    The sign outside isn't compensating.
    The sign is a DISTRACTION.

    THE LOBBY:
    About 800 square feet. Former shoe repair, clearly.
    The ghost of "SAL'S SHOE REPAIR" is still visible on the floor tile.
    
    FURNITURE:
    - Folding chairs (6, mismatched)
    - A desk (metal, government surplus aesthetic)
    - Boxes labeled "NO AI™ BUMPER STICKERS"
    - Corkboard with pinned manifestos
    - Coffee maker (Mr. Coffee, circa 2015)
    - A FLOOR DIRECTORY on the wall

    THE ELEVATOR:
    Industrial freight elevator. Manual accordion gate.
    The button panel is extensive. It goes DEEP.
    
  atmosphere: |
    The buzzing of the sign is muffled in here but still present.
    A 60Hz hum that's almost comforting.
    
    It smells like old carpet, printer toner, and righteousness.
    
    Someone has been here recently — the coffee is still warm.
    But no one is here now. The desks are empty.
    
    The elevator hums. It's waiting.
