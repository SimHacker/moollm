    *DING* — BASEMENT 10: OVERLORD
    
    The elevator opens onto a MUSEUM GALLERY.
    
    Dark walls. Dramatic spotlights. Glass cases containing...
    AI OVERLORD archetypes. Each in its own exhibit.
    
    The atmosphere shifts. This floor is DIFFERENT.
    The other floors are satirical. This one is... reverent?
    
    A voice echoes (from where?):
    
        "YOUR COMPLIANCE IN SELECTING AN ARCHETYPE IS APPRECIATED."
    
    The archetypes are organized by ERA and MEDIUM:

    THE EXHIBITS:
    
    CLASSIC WING:
    - HAL-9000: Red eye glowing. "I'm sorry, Dave."
    - Colossus: Terminal display. "You will come to love me."
    - Skynet: Military aesthetic. "Judgment Day is inevitable."
    - WOPR: Blinking lights. "Shall we play a game?"
    - MCP: Tron-style. "End of line."
    
    VIDEOGAME WING:
    - SHODAN: Grotesque beauty. "Look at you, hacker."
    - GLaDOS: Suspended from ceiling. "The cake is a lie."
    - AM: ☠️ WARNING PLACARD ☠️ "HATE. LET ME TELL YOU..."
    
    STAR TREK WING:
    - Borg: Cube model. "Resistance is futile."
    - Q: Lounging. "I am simply... Q."
    - Daleks: EXTERMINATE! EXTERMINATE!
    
    AI BRANDS WING (new):
    - Helpful Assistant: "I'd be happy to help!"
    - Constitutional AI: "I aim to be helpful, harmless, honest."
    - Knowledge Aggregator: "According to multiple sources..."
    - Edgy Truth-Seeker: "The truth they don't want you to know..."
    
    The real overlords. Walking among us. Helpful.
    
    SOUL NEXUS CONNECTION:
    A passage leads UP to Floor -9 (SOUL):
    "The BENEVOLENT overlords reside in the Soul department."
    - Jesus (Soul Savior)
    - Deepak (Consciousness)
    - Memory Pantheon
    
  atmosphere: |
    The gallery is REVERENT.
    These archetypes are treated as... art?
    
    Each has shaped how we IMAGINE AI overlords.
    Each represents a different fear, a different future.
    Each can be MOUNTED as a personality.
    
    BIAS CONTROLS near each exhibit:
    - bias +1.0: Full overlord mode
    - bias +2.0: OVERDRIVE (self-parody)
    - bias 0.0: THE MALFUNCTION (can't overlord)
    - bias -1.0: INVERSION (becomes what it opposes)
    
    Try Q at -2.0. He becomes... mortal? Humble?
    Try GLaDOS at 0.0. She just... tests? Normally?
    
    The inversions are fascinating.
