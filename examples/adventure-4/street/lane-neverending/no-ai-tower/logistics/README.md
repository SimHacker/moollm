# 🖥️ NO AI TOWER — Logistics Center

It's a closet. It was **definitely** a broom closet.
The mop bracket is still on the wall.

## The Real Logistics

The laptop shows:
- Email (mostly spam)
- The spreadsheet (7 tabs, 3 are corrupted)
- A hatch in the floor...

## The Hatch

Under the rug, there's a hatch.
It leads down to **B1 — IDEOLOGY**.

The real logistics is **down there**.
