# Leela has a nerve center with banks of screens.
# NO AI Tower has a converted broom closet with a laptop.
# Both serve the same function at vastly different scales.

    The LOGISTICS CENTER of NO AI TOWER.
    
    It's a closet. It was definitely a broom closet.
    The mop bracket is still on the wall.

    A sign taped to the door:
    "LOGISTICS CENTER — AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY"
    (Everyone is authorized. There's like three employees.)
    
  examine: |
    THE LAPTOP:
    MacBook Air, 2019. Stickers on the lid.
    Currently showing:
    - Gmail (3 unread)
    - Spreadsheet: "Inventory Tracker 2026"
    - Browser tab: USPS tracking
    - Slack: #logistics (2 members)
    
    THE WALL CALENDAR:
    January 2026. Dates circled:
    - 15th: "Ship bumper sticker order"
    - 22nd: "T-shirt restock?"
    - 28th: "SIGN MAINTENANCE" (in red)
    
    THE CLIPBOARDS:
    1. Shipping log (current month)
    2. Inventory checklist
    3. "THINGS TO FIX" (long list)
    
    THE PRINTER:
    Inkjet. HP something.
    Low on cyan. Always low on cyan.
    Used for shipping labels, manifestos, the occasional flyer.
    
    THE MAIL BINS:
    INCOMING | OUTGOING | RETURNS
    (Returns bin is empty. "Our products don't get returned.")
    
    THE CENTRAL DISPLAY:
    There is no central display.
    There's a sticky note with important numbers:
    
        USPS: 1-800-ASK-USPS
        UPS:  1-800-PICK-UPS
        Sign Guy: Steve 555-0147
        Pizza: Mario's 555-PIZZA
        
  philosophy: |
    Leela has SYSTEMS.
    NO AI Tower has CLIPBOARD.
    
    Both work. Leela scales to millions.
    NO AI Tower scales to... dozens?
    
    But here's the thing:
    The logistics CENTER is underground.
    The DEPARTMENTS are the products.
    This closet just ships the artifacts.
    
    The real logistics is in the elevator.
