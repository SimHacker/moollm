    A weatherproof camera mounted on a tall post near the Origin Tree,
    overlooking the rooftop garden and the sky above. Drones land
    within its view. Eventually the tortoise moves... eventually.

        The rooftop garden spreads out below.
        The Origin Tree sways gently.
        Eventually contemplates existence.
        A drone descends onto Pad 3.
        
        Beyond the edge: Lane Neverending stretches
        east and west, lamp posts glowing.
        The pub's sign is visible. Someone waves.
