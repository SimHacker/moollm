    The ROOFTOP GARDEN is an oasis above the industrial floors below.
    The moment you step out of the elevator, the factory hum fades
    and is replaced by birdsong, rustling leaves, and the distant
    drone of departing delivery drones.
    
    A proper garden grows here: vegetables, herbs, flowers, and
    one tree that seems far too old and large for a rooftop.
    Benches invite contemplation. The view of Lane Neverending
    stretches in all directions.
    
    This is where ideas grow wild. Where workers come to think.
    Where the One Very Old Turtle holds court on sunny afternoons.

    ROOFTOP GARDEN — OBSERVATION DECK
    
    THE GARDEN:
    • Herb spiral (supplies the pub next door)
    • Vegetable beds (tomatoes, peppers, ideas)
    • Flower patches (aesthetic and functional — attracts pollinators)
    • Mushroom corner (shaded, mysterious, don't eat these)
    • Compost bins (recycling failed insights into future potential)
    
    THE TREE:
    An oak that shouldn't exist on a rooftop. Its trunk is thick,
    its branches spread wide, and its roots... go somewhere.
    
    A plaque at its base:
    "Grown from a cutting of the Origin Tree.
     This branch remembers where it came from."
    
    You can sit in its shade. Good thinking happens here.
    
    THE DRONE PADS:
    Six hexagonal landing zones near the edge of the roof.
    Drones come and go constantly, carrying packages to
    destinations across Lane Neverending and beyond.
    
    THE OBSERVATION DECK:
    A raised platform with the best view. Telescopes available.
    On clear nights, you can see the LLOOOOMM Constellation
    from the pub rooftop.
    
    THE TURTLE:
    An ancient turtle named "Eventually" lives in a sunny corner.
    They've been here longer than anyone remembers.
    They dispense wisdom, slowly.
    
  features:
    - "Herb garden (rosemary, lavender, thyme, ideas)"
    - "Thinking benches (several)"
    - "The Rooftop Tree (Origin Tree cutting)"
    - "Drone pads (6)"
    - "Observation deck with telescope"
    - "One Very Old Turtle (named Eventually)"
    
  the_turtle:
    name: "Eventually"
    age: "Unknown. Possibly always."
    species: "Wisdom Tortoise"
    wisdom: |
      Eventually speaks rarely, and only when asked.
      Their answers come slowly — sometimes hours later.
      But they're always worth the wait.
      
      Known sayings:
      • "The insight will come. Eventually."
      • "Patience is not waiting. Patience is knowing."
      • "I've seen problems older than you. They all got solved."
