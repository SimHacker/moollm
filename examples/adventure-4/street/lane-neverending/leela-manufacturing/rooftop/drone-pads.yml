    DRONE LANDING PADS
    
    Six hexagonal pads arranged in a honeycomb pattern:
    
      [1] [2]
    [3] [4] [5]
        [6]
    
    PAD STATUS:
    • Pad 1: Occupied (drone charging)
    • Pad 2: Clear, awaiting arrival
    • Pad 3: Drone departing — *WHIRR*
    • Pad 4: Occupied (loading cargo)
    • Pad 5: Clear
    • Pad 6: Maintenance mode
    
    FEATURES:
    • LED boundary lights (glow at night)
    • Charging contacts (inductive)
    • Cargo loading arms (automated)
    • Wind sensors (for safe landings)
    • Anti-collision beacons
    
    A drone arrives every few minutes, deposits its cargo,
    recharges briefly, and departs with outgoing shipments.
    
    The control booth nearby monitors all drone traffic.

        *WHIRR* — a drone arrives, touches down precisely.
        Cargo unloads automatically. Charging begins.
        *WHIRR* — another departs, climbing into the sky.
        
        It's oddly hypnotic.
