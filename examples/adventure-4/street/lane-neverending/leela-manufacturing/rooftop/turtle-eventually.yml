    EVENTUALLY — WISDOM TORTOISE
    
    An enormous tortoise, shell weathered by countless seasons.
    Currently: basking in a sunbeam, eyes half-closed.
    
    STATS:
    • Name: Eventually
    • Age: Unknown. Possibly always.
    • Species: Wisdom Tortoise (Testudo sapientia)
    • Role: Wisdom Consultant, R&D Basement (on loan to Rooftop)
    • Speed: Deliberate

    THE LEGEND:
    Eventually arrived before the building was finished.
    Some say they advised on the architecture.
    The construction crew just worked around them.
    
    KNOWN WISDOM:
    • "The insight will come. Eventually."
    • "Patience is not waiting. Patience is knowing."
    • "I've seen problems older than you. They all got solved."
    • "Fast is just slow that hasn't arrived yet."
    • "..." (sometimes the wisdom is silence)
    
    Eventually speaks rarely, and only when asked.
    Their answers come slowly — sometimes hours later.
    But they're always worth the wait.

    ASK:
      description: "Ask Eventually for wisdom"
      effect: |
        Eventually opens one ancient eye.
        Considers your question.
        
        ...
        
        (The answer will come. Eventually.)
        
    WAIT:
      description: "Wait for Eventually's response"
      effect: |
        Time passes. The sun moves. Eventually shifts slightly.
        
        Then, slowly:
        
        "The question... contains its answer. 
         You knew. You just hadn't arrived yet."
         
    FEED:
      description: "Offer Eventually some lettuce"
      effect: |
        Eventually accepts the offering with dignity.
        Chewing takes a while. No rush.
        
        This is not a bribe. This is respect.
        (It might help, though.)
        
    SIT:
      description: "Sit quietly with Eventually"
      effect: |
        You sit. Eventually basks.
        No words are needed.
        
        Something in you slows down.
        Something in you understands.

    description: |
      Eventually processes questions in order of importance,
      not order of asking. Urgency is not importance.
      
      Some questions get answered immediately.
      Some take decades.
      Some are answered before they're asked.
