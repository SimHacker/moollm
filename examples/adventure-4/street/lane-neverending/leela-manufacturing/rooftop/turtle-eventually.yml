    EVENTUALLY — WISDOM TORTOISE
    ════════════════════════════
    
    An enormous tortoise, shell weathered by countless seasons.
    Currently: basking in a sunbeam, eyes half-closed.
    
    STATS:
    • Name: Eventually
    • Age: Unknown. Possibly always.
    • Species: Wisdom Tortoise (Testudo sapientia)
    • Role: Wisdom Consultant, R&D Basement (on loan to Rooftop)

    THE LEGEND:
    Eventually arrived before the building was finished.
    Some say they advised on the architecture.
    The construction crew just worked around them.
    
    KNOWN WISDOM:
    • "The insight will come. Eventually."
    • "Patience is not waiting. Patience is knowing."
    • "I've seen problems older than you. They all got solved."
    • "Fast is just slow that hasn't arrived yet."
    • "..." (sometimes the wisdom is silence)
    
    Eventually speaks rarely, and only when asked.
    Their answers come slowly — sometimes hours later.
    But they're always worth the wait.

    ASK:
      description: "Ask Eventually for wisdom"
      effect: |
        Eventually opens one ancient eye.
        Considers your question.
        
        ...
        
        (The answer will come. Eventually.)
        
    WAIT:
      description: "Wait for Eventually's response"
      effect: |
        Time passes. The sun moves. Eventually shifts slightly.
        
        Then, slowly:
        
        "The question... contains its answer. 
         You knew. You just hadn't arrived yet."
         
    FEED:
      description: "Offer Eventually some lettuce"
      effect: |
        Eventually accepts the offering with dignity.
        Chewing takes a while. No rush.
        
        This is not a bribe. This is respect.
        (It might help, though.)
        
    SIT:

      effect: |
        You sit. Eventually basks.
        No words are needed.
        
        Something in you slows down.
        Something in you understands.

      Eventually processes questions in order of importance,
      not order of asking. Urgency is not importance.
      
      Some questions get answered immediately.
      Some take decades.
      Some are answered before they're asked.
