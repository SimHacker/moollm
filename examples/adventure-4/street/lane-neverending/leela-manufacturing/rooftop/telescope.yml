      effect: |
        The street stretches out below and beyond.
        You can see:
        • Pedestrians going about their business
        • A cart rattling toward the pub
        • Someone waving from the Origin Tree plaza
        • The painted tunnel on ACME Surplus (a coyote is trying again)

    PUB:

      effect: |
        The Rusty Lantern's roof is just next door.
        Someone is looking back through THEIR telescope.
        You wave. They wave.
        
        This happens every time.
        
  notes:
    - "Do not look directly at the sun (the telescope will refuse)"
    - "Some viewers report seeing 'the future' but this is unconfirmed"
    - "The telescope and the pub's telescope have been 'waving' for years"
