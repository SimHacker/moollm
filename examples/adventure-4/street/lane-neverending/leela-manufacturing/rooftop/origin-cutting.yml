    An oak tree that shouldn't exist on a rooftop. Its trunk is thick,
    its branches spread wide, and its roots... go somewhere.

    THE ROOFTOP TREE
    
    An oak of impossible presence. Far too old, far too large,
    for a rooftop garden. Yet here it stands.
    
    A bronze plaque at its base:
    
    ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │  Grown from a cutting of the Origin    │
    │  Tree at 1 Lane Neverending.           │
    │                                         │
    │  This branch remembers where it came   │
    │  from. Its roots reach down through    │
    │  the building, seeking stories.        │
    │                                         │
    │  Planted: [DATE FORGOTTEN]             │
    │  Expected lifespan: Indefinite         │
    └─────────────────────────────────────────┘
    
    The bark is carved with initials — workers past and present.
    The oldest carvings are in character encodings that predate Unicode.
    
    Sitting under this tree, problems seem smaller.
    Solutions seem closer. The shade is cool and wise.

        You sit beneath the spreading branches.
        The factory noise fades. Time slows.
        Good thinking happens here.

        The bark is warm. 
        For a moment, you feel connected to the Origin Tree,
        to Lane Neverending, to everything that came before.

        The branches are sturdy and inviting.
        From up here, you can see farther than the building should allow.
        Is that... the Origin Tree itself? In the distance?
