    Beyond a heavy freight elevator, the DEEP STORAGE opens up:
    a cavern carved from bedrock, filled with miniaturized buildings.
    
    These aren't containers — they're ROOMS. BUILDINGS. STRUCTURES.
    Each one a prototype, scaled down for storage but fully functional
    when cloned and deployed at full size.

    A control booth overlooks the cavern. Inside, an operator
    named "Archie" manages the architectural deployment system.

    DEEP STORAGE — ARCHITECTURAL PROTOTYPES
    
    THE CONCEPT:
    Every building here is a prototype — a template for cloning.
    When you need a lair, you CLONE it. The original stays pristine.
    
    THE SCALE:
    Prototypes are stored at 1:100 scale in climate-controlled cases.
    When cloned and deployed, they expand to full size.
    Some customers prefer to keep pocket-sized backup copies.
    
    THE GUARANTEE:
    Unlike ACME prefabs, Leela buildings:
    - Don't collapse dramatically
    - Don't have obvious weak points for heroes
    - Don't come with self-destruct buttons by default
    - Are actually up to code
    
    DEPLOYMENT:
    1. Select a prototype
    2. Specify location
    3. Clone and deploy
    4. Move in

    The hum of climate control. Dramatic lighting on miniature buildings.
    Occasional *pop* as a prototype is cloned and deployed somewhere.
