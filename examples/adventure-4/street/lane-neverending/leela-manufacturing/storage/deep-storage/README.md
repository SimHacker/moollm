# 🏗️ Deep Storage — Architectural Division

> *"Need a lair? Clone one."*

**Pre-fab buildings and rooms for cloning.**

---

## 🌅 Overview

Beyond a heavy freight elevator, the DEEP STORAGE opens up: a cavern carved from bedrock, filled with miniaturized buildings.

These aren't containers — they're **ROOMS. BUILDINGS. STRUCTURES.** Each one a prototype, scaled down for storage but fully functional when cloned and deployed at full size.
