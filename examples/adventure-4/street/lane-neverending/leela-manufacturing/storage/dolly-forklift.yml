    DOLLY — SENIOR RETRIEVAL SPECIALIST
    ════════════════════════════════════
    
    A small yellow forklift with:
    - Faded "DOLLY" name sticker on the side
    - Motivational bumper sticker: "Lift With Your Forks, Not Your Feelings"
    - Dent collection telling 40 years of stories
    - Fluffy dice hanging from the roll cage
    
    Dolly has an uncanny ability to know exactly which shelf
    holds which prototype, even the ones that were moved last week.
    
    She communicates via beeps:
    - *beep* — Acknowledged
    - *beep beep* — Following you
    - *BEEP BEEP BEEP* — You're in the way
    - *sad beep* — That prototype doesn't exist
