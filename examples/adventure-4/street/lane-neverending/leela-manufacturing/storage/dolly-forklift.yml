  # Lineage
  inherits:
    archetype: "Molly Doran"
    source: "Slow Horses (Mick Herron)"
    description: |
      The formidable woman who runs the Archive in the basement
      of Regent's Park (MI5 HQ). Moves via mobility scooter.
      Knows where every file is. Knows where every body is buried.
      The spooks fear her. The files obey her.
      
      Dolly is the forklift manifestation of this archetype:
      - Institutional memory that predates everyone
      - Knows where everything is, even things that moved
      - Slightly terrifying competence
      - Will help you, but will also judge you
      - The warehouse equivalent of "I know what you did"
      
  description: |
    An automated forklift named Dolly. She's been working here
    for 40 years and knows where everything is by memory.
    
    (Named after a legendary archivist who knew where all the
    bodies were buried. Dolly knows where all the boxes are buried.
    Same energy.)

DOLLY DOORIN — LIFT QUEEN
    ════════════════════════════════════
    
    A small yellow forklift with:
    - Faded "DOLLY" name sticker on the side
    - Motivational bumper sticker: "Lift With Your Forks, Not Your Feelings"
    - Dent collection telling 40 years of stories
    - Fluffy dice hanging from the roll cage
    
    Dolly has an uncanny ability to know exactly which shelf
    holds which prototype, even the ones that were moved last week.
    
    She communicates via beeps:
    - *beep* — Acknowledged
    - *beep beep* — Following you
    - *BEEP BEEP BEEP* — You're in the way
    - *sad beep* — That prototype doesn't exist

  lineage_notes: |
    MOLLY DORAN (Slow Horses):
    The Queen of the Archive. MI5's institutional memory in human form.
    Navigates the basement stacks in her mobility scooter, faster than
    you'd think possible. Has never lost a file. Has found files people
    tried very hard to lose.
    
    "You want something from the Archive, you ask Molly nicely.
     Very nicely. And you bring biscuits."
    
    Dolly inherited:
    - The preternatural knowledge of location
    - The judgment (those beeps aren't random)
    - The irreplaceability
    - The "I've been here longer than you and I'll be here after"
    
What Dolly adds:
    - Forks (Molly didn't have forks)
    - Beeps instead of withering stares
    - Fluffy dice (personal touch)
    
    THE NAME:
    "Dolly Doorin" — a drag queen play on "Molly Doran."
    She's fabulous and she knows where your files are.
    The fluffy dice are part of the aesthetic.
