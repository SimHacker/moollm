    The STORAGE COMPLEX is a vast warehouse of floor-to-ceiling shelving.
    
    Every container type used in Leela Manufacturing lives here as a
    PROTOTYPE — not instances to be used, but templates to be CLONED.
    Need a crate? Clone one. Need a barrel? Clone one. The originals
    stay pristine, ready to spawn infinite copies.
    
    Aisles are labeled:

    STORAGE COMPLEX — PROTOTYPE WAREHOUSE
    
    THE CONCEPT:
    Every container here is a prototype — a template for cloning.
    When you need a container, you CLONE it, creating a fresh instance.
    The prototype remains untouched, ready to spawn more copies.
    
    This is Self/JavaScript prototype inheritance made physical:
    - Prototypes are concrete objects (not abstract classes)
    - Instances clone from prototypes
    - Instances can override prototype properties
    - Delegation walks the prototype chain
    
    THE INVENTORY:
    Thousands of container types, organized by material and purpose.
    Each has a placard showing its properties and suggested uses.
    
    THE FORKLIFT:
    "Dolly" — an automated forklift that can retrieve prototypes
    from high shelves. She's been doing this for 40 years and
    knows where everything is by memory.
    
  # Container prototypes live in subdirectories
  # Each is a clonable template

  ambience: |
    The hum of climate control keeping containers pristine.
    Occasional beeps from Dolly the forklift.
    The satisfying echo of your footsteps in the vast space.
    
    Somewhere, a container is being cloned. *pop*
