# BASEMENT — R&D LABORATORY
# Where experimental knowledge is manufactured

room:
  name: Leela Basement — R&D Laboratory
  type: laboratory
  
  lighting: dim_with_occasional_flashes
  atmosphere: mysterious
  
  description: |
    The R&D LABORATORY occupies the entire basement. The lighting is
    intentionally dim — some experiments prefer it that way. Occasional
    flashes illuminate bubbling beakers, sparking equipment, and
    researchers in goggles hunched over incomprehensible apparatus.
    
    A sign at the entrance:

    R&D LABORATORY — BASEMENT
    
    THE LAYOUT:
    The basement is divided into zones, each more experimental
    than the last:
    
    Zone 1: Controlled experiments (relatively safe)
    Zone 2: Uncontrolled experiments (wear goggles)
    Zone 3: Theoretical work (whiteboards only)
    Zone 4: Applied madness (sign waiver first)
Zone 5: The Archive (historical knowledge storage)
    Zone 6: Cold storage (temperature-sensitive insights)
    Zone 7: [SEALED] (we don't talk about Zone 7)
    
    WAREHOUSE 23: (heavy security door, keycard required)
    Long-term storage for dangerous artifacts. Impossibly large.
    "Top men are working on it."
    
    THE RESEARCHERS:
    • Mad Scientists (3, varying degrees of madness)
    • Reasonable Scientists (5, keeping things grounded)
    • One Unreasonable Scientist (title: "Dr. Why Not")
    • Graduate students (infinite, replaceable)
    • One Very Old Turtle (wisdom consultant, Zone 5)
    
    EQUIPMENT:
    • Bubbling things
    • Sparking things
    • Things that hum ominously
    • One thing that's perfectly silent (most concerning)
    • A chalkboard covered in equations that hurt to look at
    
    THE FORBIDDEN SHELF:
    A locked cabinet containing experiments deemed "too successful."
    Label: "IN CASE OF EMERGENCY, DO NOT OPEN. ESPECIALLY THEN."
    
  warnings:
    - "Do not feed the hypotheses"
    - "Protective eyewear required beyond Zone 1"
    - "If you hear your name from Zone 7, ignore it"
    - "Coffee in designated areas only (reactions possible)"

        Zone 7 is sealed. Heavy doors. Warning lights.
        A sign: "NO ENTRY. WE MEAN IT. THE DOOR IS LOCKED FOR YOUR PROTECTION."
        You can hear... something... on the other side.
        It might be humming.
      blocked: true
      reason: "Paradox containment"
      
    warehouse:

      description: |
        A heavy security door marked "WAREHOUSE 23 — AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY."
        Keycard reader. Biometric scanner. A third lock that checks something
        ineffable about your soul.
        
        Through the small window, you can see endless rows of crates
        stretching into impossible distance.
