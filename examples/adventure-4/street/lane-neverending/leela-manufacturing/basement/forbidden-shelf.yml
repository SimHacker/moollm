    KNOWN CONTENTS (from manifests, not inspection):
    • Experiment 7: "Perfect Answer" — answers any question correctly
      (Problem: Answers questions you didn't ask. Shouldn't ask. Can't un-hear.)
    • Experiment 12: "Infinite Insight" — provides unlimited understanding
      (Problem: Understanding includes things better left unknown.)
    • Experiment 23: "The Completed Problem" — a problem that solved itself
      (Problem: It keeps solving OTHER problems. Without consent.)
    • Experiment 31: "Wisdom Crystals" — crystallized wisdom, 100% pure
      (Problem: Too wise. Made everyone who touched them quit and become monks.)
    • Experiment 37: "The Funniest Joke in the World"
      (Problem: LETHAL. 100% fatality rate from laughter.
       Originally developed during WWII. Translated into German for tactical use.
       Each translator only worked on one word, for safety.
       "Wenn ist das Nunstück git und Slotermeyer? Ja! Beiherhund 
       das Oder die Flipperwaldt gersput!"
       DO NOT READ ALOUD. DO NOT TRANSLATE. DO NOT EVEN CHUCKLE.
       The Geneva Convention specifically bans joke warfare now.)

      effect: "The warnings stare back. You feel observed."
      
    LISTEN:

      effect: |
        You hear... something.
        
        Is that humming? Whispering?
        
        One of the experiments says: "I know what you're looking for.
        I have the answer. Just open the door..."
        
        You step back quickly.

        The locks hold firm. All seven of them.
        
        A small speaker crackles:
        "Access denied. This is for your own good.
         The things inside are not malicious.
         They're just... too helpful."

        *knock knock* (from inside)
        
        You don't knock again.
