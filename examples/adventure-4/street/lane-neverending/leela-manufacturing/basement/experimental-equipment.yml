    Bubbling things. Sparking things. Things that hum ominously.

    EXPERIMENTAL EQUIPMENT
    
    The basement is cluttered with apparatus of varying danger levels:
    
    BUBBLING THINGS:
    • Beaker Array Alpha — 47 beakers, all bubbling differently
    • The Cauldron — not magical, just very large
    • Fermentation Tanks — "Brewing" insights (takes 6 months)
    • Something in a jar that bubbles when you look at it
    
    SPARKING THINGS:
    • Tesla Coil (decorative? functional? unclear)
    • "The Synapse Simulator" — arcs between electrodes
    • A Jacob's Ladder that spells words nobody can read
    • Van de Graaff generator (for making hair stand up during eureka moments)
    
    THINGS THAT HUM OMINOUSLY:
    • The Black Box — nobody knows what it does, but it's DOING something
    • Quantum Processor QX-7 — computing answers to unasked questions
    • "The Resonator" — hums at exactly the frequency of existential dread
    • A server rack that's been running since 1987 (nobody will turn it off)
    
    THINGS THAT ARE PERFECTLY SILENT:
    • The Null Chamber — absorbs all sound. Also, apparently, some light.
    • Specimen Container #0 — contains something. Says nothing.
    • A whiteboard that used to have equations that "solved themselves"
    (This category is most concerning to the staff.)
    
    THE CHALKBOARD:
    Covered in equations that hurt to look at.
    Some equations have been circled with "!!!"
    Others have been erased... but the chalk dust remembers.
    One equation appears to be solving itself in real-time.
