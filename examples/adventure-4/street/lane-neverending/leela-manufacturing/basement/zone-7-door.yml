    A heavy blast door separating Zone 7 from the rest of the basement.
    Warning lights flash. The door is sealed.
    Something on the other side knows you're there.

    THE DOOR:
    Three feet of blast-resistant steel. Reinforced with something
    that looks like lead but probably isn't. Warning lights rotate
    slowly — red, yellow, red, yellow.
    
    THE WINDOW:
    A small, thick viewport allows you to see inside.
    What you see... doesn't make sense.
    The room appears to be both occupied and empty.
    There's a researcher at a whiteboard, but also nobody.
    The equations on the board solve themselves, then unsolve.
    
    THE SOUNDS:
    You can hear something through the door.
    Humming? Talking? Both?
    Sometimes it sounds like your own voice.
    (It's not. Probably.)
    
    THE PROJECT:
    Zone 7 handles paradox processing.
    "We understand the problem. The problem understands us back."
    Dr. Unknown (identity classified) leads the team.
    Or teams. The count is... uncertain.
    
  state:
    sealed: true
    warning_lights: "active"
    sounds: "humming"
    personnel_count: "indeterminate"
    
  locked: true
  lockable: true

    LOOK_THROUGH_WINDOW:
      description: "Peer through the viewport"
      effect: |
        You look inside Zone 7.
        
        You see a researcher working at a whiteboard.
        They turn and wave at you.
        But they're also not there.
        But they are.
        
        The whiteboard says: "If this statement is false..."
        You look away before reading the rest.
        
    LISTEN:
      description: "Listen at the door"
      effect: |
        You press your ear to the cold steel.
        
        Humming. Definitely humming.
        And... is that your name?
        
        No. It's not. Ignore it.
        
        (But it really did sound like your name.)
        
    KNOCK:
      description: "Knock on the door"
      effect: |
        *knock knock knock*
        
        From inside: *knock knock knock*
        
        Exactly the same rhythm.
        
        You didn't knock again. But you hear: *knock knock knock*
        
        This is why we don't knock on Zone 7.
        
    ATTEMPT_OPEN:
      description: "Try to open the door"
      effect: |
        The door doesn't move. Of course it doesn't.
        
        A speaker crackles:
        "Zone 7 access requires Level Omega clearance,
         Dr. Unknown's approval, and acceptance that
         'you' is a flexible concept in this zone."
         
        You don't have any of those things.
        
        (Do you even want to enter? Does the you that would
        enter still want to by the time they're inside?)
        
  warnings:
    - "Do not knock"
    - "Do not listen"
    - "Do not look too long"
    - "If you hear your name, it's NOT calling you"
    - "Personnel count is SUPPOSED to be uncertain"
