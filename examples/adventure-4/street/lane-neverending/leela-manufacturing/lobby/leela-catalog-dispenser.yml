    A polished wooden kiosk stands in the lobby of Leela Manufacturing.
    It's warm inside. There's a comfortable chair nearby.
    
    The kiosk displays neatly stacked catalogs bound in dark green
    leather with gold embossing. A brass plaque reads:
    
    "LEELA PRODUCTS CATALOG"
    "Dependable. Tested. Robust-First."
    
    "Please take one. Read here or take home."
    "Orders placed at reception or via catalog."
    "Pickup at loading docks or delivery anywhere."
    
    Unlike the ACME dispenser across the street (rusting in the rain),
    this one is indoors, well-maintained, and doesn't have scorch marks.

    LEELA CATALOG DISPENSER
    
    A handsome wooden kiosk, about 4 feet tall, with a glass front
    showing neatly arranged catalogs. The wood is polished walnut.
    The brass fittings are well-maintained. It smells like furniture oil.
    
    THE CATALOGS:
    Each one is bound in dark green leather with gold embossing.
    The Leela logo — a stylized leaf — catches the lobby light.
    Edition 47. Substantial but not intimidating.
    
    THE MECHANISM:
    A simple latch. No tricks. No coin slot.
    Pull gently, take a catalog. The next one slides forward.
    
    THE ENVIRONMENT:
    You're inside. It's warm. There's coffee available at reception.
    Comfortable seating if you want to browse here.
    No rain. No wind. No anvils falling from the sky.
    
    THE FINE PRINT:
    A small brass label on the side:
    "Catalogs are free. Products work as described. We mean it."
    
    THE VIEW:
    Through the lobby window, you can see the ACME dispenser
    across the street. It's getting rained on. Again.

      effect: |
        You open the latch. It moves smoothly.
        
        A catalog slides into your hands. It has the pleasant
        weight of quality paper and leather binding.
        
        The leaf logo catches the light.
        
        INVENTORY: + LEELA PRODUCTS CATALOG (ref)
        
        (This is an INSTANCE pointing to ./leela-catalog.yml)
        (The prototype stays here. You carry a lightweight pointer.)
        
        Alex at reception nods approvingly.
        "Good choice. Let us know if you have questions."

        You take a catalog to the nearby seating area.
        
        There's a comfortable chair. Good lighting.
        Someone offers you coffee. You accept.
        
        You flip through the sections:
        STORAGE... LOGISTICS... DRONES... INFRASTRUCTURE...
        SURVEILLANCE... MAPPING... POSTAL... FACTORIO PROTOCOLS...
        
        Everything has clear descriptions. Honest specifications.
        Realistic delivery times. Actual warranty terms.
        
        No malfunction percentages. No ironic warnings.
        No fine print too small to read.
