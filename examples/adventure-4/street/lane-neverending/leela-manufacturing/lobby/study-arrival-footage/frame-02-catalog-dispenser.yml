    The Study door opened. Don stepped out first.
    Richard followed, setting his tea down carefully on the side table.
    (The Study preserves state. The tea will still be warm later.)
    
    "Let me show you what we make here," Don says.
    
    He leads Richard to the catalog dispenser — polished walnut,
    brass fittings, dark green leather volumes with gold embossing.
    The anti-ACME.
    
    Richard takes one. Opens it.
    
    Don points to various sections:
    "Factorio protocols. Pneumatic networks. Surveillance that helps
    instead of punishes. And look — TomTomagotchi."
    
    Richard: "...a GPS pet that gets sad if you ignore routes?"
    
    Don: "Navigation should be FUN."
    
    In the background, the Study hovers with its dropped walls,
    Heuristic still visible on the radiator, one eye watching them.

    CAMERA: LOB1 (primary), now focused on the catalog dispenser area
    ANGLE: Medium shot — Don and Richard at the dispenser, Study behind
    TIME: Morning, moments after arrival
    
    THE FOREGROUND — THE CATALOG DISPENSER:
    Polished walnut kiosk, about 4 feet tall. Glass front showing
    neatly arranged catalogs. Brass fittings catching lobby light.
    
    DON HOPKINS:
    Standing beside the dispenser, one hand gesturing at the open
    catalog Richard is holding. Hawaiian shirt a riot of color.
    Bunny ears casting small shadows. Expression: delighted presenter.
    Pointing at something in the catalog. "See? TomTomagotchi!"
    
    RICHARD BARTLE:
    Holding open the dark green leather catalog. Pages visible —
    product listings, diagrams, honest specifications.
    Expression: scholarly interest mixed with amusement.
    Blue cardigan over collared shirt. Silver-white hair.
    Reading glasses if he has them (or squinting professorialy).
    
    THE CATALOG ITSELF (visible):
    Open to the MAPPING section (page 55+).
    The TomTomagotchi entry visible:
    - "GPS pet companion, needs feeding and attention"
    - "Gets sad if you ignore route suggestions"
    - "Happy chirps when you arrive"
    
    THE BACKGROUND — THE STUDY:
    Still hovering in the lobby, outer walls still dropped.
    Through the transparent walls:
    - Bookshelves visible
    - The armchair (empty now, Richard's tea on side table)
    - The radiator with Heuristic still draped across it
    - Warm amber glow contrasting with lobby
    
    The Study is WATCHING them through its dropped walls.
    Like a parent keeping an eye on children at the park.
    
    OTHER LOBBY ELEMENTS:
    - Alex at reception, now composed, helping another visitor
      (but glancing at the Study periodically)
    - The scale model under glass
    - Through windows: ACME Surplus visible across the street
      (the painted tunnel, the reminder)
    - ACM1 camera back to watching the tunnel
      (but one suspects it glances back sometimes)
      
  prompt_for_visualizer: |
    Security camera footage, medium shot, polished industrial lobby.
    
    TWO MEN at a wooden catalog dispenser (polished walnut, brass fittings):
    
    - STANDING MAN in loud Hawaiian shirt and RABBIT EARS, gesturing
      enthusiastically at an open catalog. Expression: delighted tour guide.
      
    - ELDERLY MAN holding the open catalog (dark green leather, gold embossing),
      silver-white hair, blue cardigan, reading with scholarly amusement.
      The catalog is open to product listings.
    
    IN THE BACKGROUND: A VICTORIAN STUDY hovers in the lobby.
    Its outer walls are TRANSPARENT (Sims cutaway effect) revealing:
    - Bookshelves packed with old volumes
    - An empty leather armchair with tea cup on side table
    - A SMALL AMBER DRAGON on a cast-iron radiator, watching
    - Warm amber light inside vs. cool industrial lobby outside
    
    THE LOBBY:
    - Polished concrete floor, exposed brick walls
    - Modern reception desk with receptionist
    - Green plants, professional signage
    - Through window: abandoned building visible across street
    
    STYLE: Security camera aesthetic — wide angle, timestamp overlay
    "LOB1 — 2026-01-23 — 10:17:03", slight surveillance grain.
    
    MOOD: Discovery and delight. The impossible has become normal.
    Old friends exploring what's possible.

        "Navigation should be FUN, Richard!
         A modal dialog saying 'turn left' is VIOLENCE.
         A little creature that gets excited about new routes?
         That's JOY."

         This is game design applied to navigation.

      posture: "Helping visitor, but glancing at Study"
      expression: "Professional with undertones of 'is that still there?'"

    And Richard is thinking: "This is what game design looks like
    when applied to mundane tools. The device has MOTIVATIONS."
    
  visual_contrast: |
    FOREGROUND: Two humans examining technology (catalog)
    BACKGROUND: A magic room with a dragon watching
    
    The juxtaposition:
    - They're discussing GPS navigation pets
    - Behind them, a Victorian study hovers in an industrial lobby
    - On the radiator, an actual dragon observes
    - The catalog has honest specifications
    - The room has TARDIS capabilities
    
    The mundane (catalogs, products, navigation) meets the impossible
    (flying rooms, dragons, dropped walls). And everyone's acting like
    this is NORMAL. Because in MOOLLM, it is.
    
  the_study_in_background: |
    The Study remains hovering with dropped walls.
    It's not DOING anything. Just BEING there.
    
    But its presence transforms the scene:
    - The industrial lobby now has a Victorian heart
    - The cool fluorescence has a warm amber counterpoint
    - The professional space has a dragon
    
    Heuristic is watching Don and Richard.
    The Study is watching Heuristic.
    LOB1 is watching everything.
    ACM1 is watching ACME.
    (But probably thinking about the room.)
    
  what_happens_next: |
    Richard finishes browsing the catalog.
    
    "Factorio protocols. Self-healing modules. Pneumatic networks.
     You've adapted factory optimization to narrative production."
    
    "The factory must grow," Don says. "But the product is insight."
    
    "Show me the Insight Furnace," Richard requests.
    
    They step back into the Study.
