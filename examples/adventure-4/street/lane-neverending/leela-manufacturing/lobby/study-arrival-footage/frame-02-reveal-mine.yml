  camera: LOB1

fordite_layers:

  - layer: character_interaction
    richard: "Has a slight 'first time flying' expression — amused but observant."
    don: "The 'Leela Visitor' pass on his shirt is actually a 'MASTER ACCESS' badge. Emergent detail: the badge has a small rabbit icon on it."
    heuristic: "Breaking the fourth wall. The dragon's stare is breaking the LOB1 facial recognition algorithm (the box is flickering)."

  - layer: architectural_synthesis
    detail: |
      The Study's rug (a faded Persian pattern) appears to be
      bleeding its color into the gray concrete of the lobby,
      as if the room is terraforming its surroundings.
    visual_evidence: "A small aura of color around the base of the Study."

  - layer: security_ui
    detail: |
      LOB1 has labeled Don as 'PC_001 (RABBIT_VARIANT)'.
      LABEL: [IDENTITY: DON_HOPKINS]
      STATUS: AUTHORIZED
    note: "The system recognizes Don despite the ears."

  - layer: physics_of_presence
    detail: "The air inside the Study looks 'thicker' with dust and history than the lobby air. The transition at the dropped walls is sharp."

narrative_consequences:
  - "Heuristic is now a verified observer of the observer."
  - "The 'Master Access' badge implies the system knows Don's history here."
  - "Alex is preparing 'The Study's' official visitor paperwork."
