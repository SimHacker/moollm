      Standing with a hand on the leather chair's arm. The blue cardigan 
      is a deep navy blue. He is looking at Don with a half-smile, 
      still holding the tea cup.
    don: |
      His Hawaiian shirt is a vibrant tomato-red with large white hibiscus 
      flowers. The rabbit ears are long and textured, almost matching 
      his silver-grey hair. He's leaning casually against the dark 
      mahogany doorframe.

      The dragon has shifted position, sitting more alertly on the 
      radiator. Its long tail curls around the pipes. It seems to be 
      listening to the conversation.

  - layer: interior_texture
    detail: |
      A rich, intricate Persian rug in shades of burgundy and gold 
      covers most of the Study's floor. It adds a layer of 'home' 
      that contrasts with the cold grey concrete of the lobby.
    visual_evidence: "The rug's patterns are visible through the dropped walls."

  - layer: background_context
    detail: |
      Large, modern potted plants (possibly palms or ficus) are visible 
      in the lobby's far background, suggesting that Leela values 
      biophilic design even in its industrial spaces.
    note: "The plants echo the greenery inside Don's future FMC lot."

  - layer: physics_of_transclusion
    detail: |
      The Study is perfectly level on the floor. There is no visible 
      shimmer now; it is a part of the building's physical inventory.
    emergent_detail: "The brass globe in the corner reflects the lobby's distant windows."

narrative_consequences:
  - "The Persian rug is now canon — it travels with the Study."
  - "Don's 'Tomato-Red Hibiscus' shirt is his definitive look for the tour."
  - "The dragon's interest in Don suggests a navigator-pilot bond."
