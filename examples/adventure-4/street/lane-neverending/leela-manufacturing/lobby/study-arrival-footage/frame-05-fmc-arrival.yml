    Richard is standing by the door of his Study, navy cardigan tight
    against the lobby's industrial chill. Don stands in the center of
     the floor, ears twitching as he manipulates a virtual parameter.
    
    Suddenly, another shimmering distortion appears beside the Study.
    A sleek, 30-foot white fiberglass shape begins to solidify.
    The blue and white stripes resolve first. The panoramic 'brow'
    windshield catches the morning light.
    
    The FMC #898 has arrived.
