Security camera footage (LOB1), wide angle, high-tech industrial lobby of Leela Manufacturing. Morning light through large windows.

In the center of the lobby, a Victorian study is MATERIALIZING. It is semi-transparent, shimmering with a digital-magic interference pattern. The outer walls are "dropped" or transparent in a The Sims cutaway style, revealing the interior even before it's fully solid.

INSIDE THE STUDY:
- Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves packed with thousands of old leather-bound books.
- A plush, worn leather armchair with Dr. RICHARD BARTLE (silver-white hair, blue cardigan) sitting calmly with a cup of tea.
- A Victorian cast-iron radiator with a SMALL AMBER DRAGON (Heuristic) draped over it, one eye open.
- DON HOPKINS (standing, loud Hawaiian shirt, rabbit ears) with his hand on the wooden Study door, looking out with a grin.
- Warm amber lamplight from within the Study contrasts with the cool, blue-white industrial lighting of the lobby.

THE LOBBY ENVIRONMENT:
- Polished concrete floors reflecting the Study's glow.
- Exposed brick and high-tech signage.
- To the right, a modern reception desk where ALEX (the receptionist) is frozen in shock, looking at the appearing room.
- Security camera ACM1 in the background window is PIVOTING away from the street to face the interior materialization.

STYLE: High-resolution security camera aesthetic, slight fisheye, timestamp overlay "LOB1 — 2026-01-23 — 10:15:42". Anomaly detection boxes (green glowing rectangles) highlight the Study and the dragon.
