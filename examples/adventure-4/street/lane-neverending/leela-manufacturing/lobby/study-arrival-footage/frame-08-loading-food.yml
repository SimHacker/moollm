    With the high-tech gear secured, the pioneers turn to sustenance. 
    Leela doesn't just manufacture intelligence; it understands that 
    intelligence runs on calories.
    
    Dolly and Lolly have returned from the cafeteria level with a 
    preposterous amount of food. 
    
    Don is joyfully directing a pile of tacos and watermelons toward 
    the FMC's kitchen area. Richard is overseeing the careful placement 
    of hams and platters of spaghetti and meatballs into the Study's 
    storage nooks. 
    
    And the cheese — blocks of sharp cheddar are being stacked like 
    gold bullion.
