Security camera footage (LOB1), medium shot focused on the Leela Catalog Dispenser (a handsome polished walnut kiosk with brass fittings).

ACTION:
- Dr. RICHARD BARTLE (silver hair, blue cardigan, reading glasses) is holding an open Edition 47 catalog. The catalog is bound in dark green leather with gold embossing. He is reading a page with a look of scholarly amusement.
- DON HOPKINS (anthropomorphic rabbit in a tie-dye Hawaiian shirt) is standing next to him, pointing enthusiastically at a diagram in the open catalog. He looks like he's in the middle of a passionate explanation.
- BACKGROUND: The Victorian Study remains parked in the middle of the lobby, its outer walls still transparent (The Sims style).
- FURTHER BACKGROUND: A normal human visitor is standing by the reception desk, completely frozen, staring at the Study with total disbelief.

STYLE: High-resolution surveillance camera, timestamp: "LOB1 — 2026-01-23 — 10:17:42". Green digital bounding boxes label the catalog as "LEELA_CATALOG_ED_47" and Richard as "PC_002 (BARTLE)".
