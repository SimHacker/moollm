    detail: |
      Both pioneers are in a near-mirror pose, one arm extended 
      toward their respective interiors. It's a moment of radical 
      hospitality: 'Enter my mind, enter my home.'
    visual_evidence: "Richard (left) and Don (right) both gesturing with their left hands."

    study: |
      The Study looks solidly architectural, its mahogany walls 
      absorbing the lobby's cool light and transforming it into 
      a warm interior glow.
    fmc: |
      The FMC #898 is a sleek, aerodynamic counterpoint. Its blue 
      stripes have an emergent gold/tan accent that matches the 
      Study's brass globe. The chrome hubcaps are highly reflective.
    dragon: "Heuristic is visible through the Study's window, watching the FMC with curiosity."

  - layer: lighting_synthesis
    detail: |
      The lobby floor between the two vehicles is illuminated by two 
      distinct triangular pools of golden light spilling from the open 
      doors. Where they meet, the concrete looks like it's been gilded.
    note: "The 'intertwingling' of their light-spaces is visually literal."

  - layer: character_consistency
    richard: "Navy blue cable-knit cardigan confirmed. Silver hair catchs the light."
    don: "Tomato-red hibiscus shirt remains the definitive look. Rabbit ears are upright and attentive."

narrative_consequences:
  - "The 'Gilded Threshold' between the vehicles is now a place of power."
  - "Don and Richard have successfully demonstrated Portable Vehicular Identity."
  - "The FMC #898 blue-and-gold stripe variant is now the canon livery."
