    The Study is now fully anchored. Don has turned toward Richard,
    pointing at the door he's about to open. Richard is standing up 
    from his leather wingback chair, still clutching his tea cup.
    The brass globe in the corner glints.

    A fully solid Victorian study sitting in the center of a vast, modern 
    industrial lobby with grey floors. The walls of the study are 
    transparent like a dollhouse. 
    
    INSIDE THE STUDY:
    - Dr. RICHARD BARTLE (elderly, silver hair, blue cardigan) is standing 
      up from a rich brown leather wingback armchair, holding a cup of tea.
    - DON HOPKINS (with long grey-white rabbit ears and a vibrant 
      red-orange Hawaiian shirt) is standing by the dark wood door, 
      looking at Richard and gesturing toward the lobby.
    - A SMALL AMBER DRAGON is perched on a white cast-iron radiator.
    - A BRASS GLOBE stands in the corner.
    - Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves with thousands of colorful spines.
    - Warm golden interior light vs cool daylight through the lobby windows.
    
    STYLE: Wide angle, high detail, sharp focus. The room looks like a 
    perfectly preserved time capsule.
