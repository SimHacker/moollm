    The shimmering stops. The Study is now 100% solid. 
    It sits firmly on the lobby floor, its Victorian mahogany floor
    perfectly aligned with the Leela concrete.
    
    The "Sims cutaway" view remains active on LOB1, providing a 
    god-view of the inhabitants.
    
    Dr. Richard Bartle is carefully placing his tea cup on a 
    small mahogany side table. He looks toward the open (dropped) 
    side of the room at Alex, acknowledging the receptionist with 
    a polite nod through the "invisible" wall.
    
    Don Hopkins is leaning against the doorframe, rabbit ears 
    twitching. He's looking at Richard, gesturing toward the lobby.
    
    Heuristic the dragon has fully opened both eyes and is 
    studying the LOB1 camera directly. It knows it's being watched.

    The Study is now a physical object in the space. 
    The contrast is sharp: the dark wood and old paper of the Study 
    against the glass and brick of the lobby.
    
    - RICHARD BARTLE: Standing up from the armchair. Cardigan looks 
      tangible. He's reaching for a taxonomy book.
    - DON HOPKINS: "I told you it would work, Richard." He's wearing 
      a 'Leela Visitor' pass that has spontaneously appeared on his 
      Hawaiian shirt.
    - THE RADIATOR: Steam is rising from Heuristic's spot. The dragon 
      looks warm and satisfied.
    
    LOB1 OVERLAY:
    "STABLE OBJECT DETECTED"
    "ID: BARTLE_STUDY_001"
    "PASSENGERS: 3 (2 HUMAN-ISH, 1 REPTILIAN_ANOMALY)"

    VIEW INSIDE:
    - Dr. RICHARD BARTLE (silver hair, blue cardigan) is standing up from his leather armchair, looking with amusement at the lobby.
    - DON HOPKINS (rabbit ears, Hawaiian shirt) has one hand on the doorknob, looking back at Richard.
    - The AMBER DRAGON (Heuristic) is sitting upright on the radiator, looking directly at the security camera.
    - Bookshelves are crisp and detailed.
    
    LOBBY VIEW:
    - ALEX (receptionist) has picked up a crystal communicator, about to call security, but stops when Don waves.
    - The industrial lighting reflects off the Study's windows.
    - Green bounding boxes from the security system highlight the inhabitants.
    
    STYLE: Surveillance camera, high detail, 10:15:47 timestamp. Warm Study light is now dominating the center of the frame.
