    LOB1 detects an anomaly.
    
    In the center of the Leela Manufacturing lobby, the air shimmers.
    Not a ripple — more like reality checking its notes, then agreeing
    that yes, this is supposed to happen.
    
    A room appears.
    
    Not crashes into existence. Not teleports with a bang.
    APPEARS. Like it was always there, and we just started noticing.
    
    But the walls — the outer walls — are transparent. Dropped.
    Like The Sims when you enter a house.
    
    Through the opened walls, we see:
    - Bookshelves reaching to the ceiling
    - A worn leather armchair with someone in it
    - A radiator with something glowing on it (dragon?)
    - Standing figure in Hawaiian shirt
    - Warm amber light contrasting with lobby fluorescence
    
    ACM1, normally watching the tunnel, PIVOTS.
    Its motorized mount whirs. It has to see this.
    
    Alex at reception freezes mid-sentence.

    CAMERAS: LOB1 (interior wide), ACM1 (pivoting from window)
    ANGLE: LOB1 wide shot, slightly elevated; ACM1 turning to face interior
    TIME: Morning — natural light through lobby windows, interior warm
    
    THE LOBBY (context):
    Polished concrete floor. Exposed brick walls. Green plants.
    The Leela logo glowing on the wall behind reception.
    Scale model under glass to the right.
    Catalog dispenser visible background left.
    Industrial-modern aesthetic. Professional. Welcoming.
    
    THE STUDY (center of attention):
    A Victorian room has appeared in the middle of the industrial space.
    
    THE SIMS EFFECT:
    Outer walls are TRANSPARENT — not invisible, but see-through.
    You can see the wall SHAPE as a faint outline, but the interior
    is fully visible. Like architectural X-ray vision. Like a dollhouse
    with the front removed. Like The Sims when you're playing.
    
    VISIBLE THROUGH THE DROPPED WALLS:
    
    - BOOKSHELVES: Floor-to-ceiling, packed with volumes. 
      Old leather spines. Gold lettering catching the light.
      Some horizontal stacks where vertical ran out.
      One shelf is entirely dragons (figures, not books).
      
    - THE ARMCHAIR: Worn leather, high back, brass studs.
      RICHARD BARTLE is seated in it, tea cup in hand.
      Silver-white hair. Blue cardigan. The posture of someone
      who is completely at home, even though "home" just moved.
      Expression: scholarly curiosity, not alarm.
      
    - THE RADIATOR: Cast iron, Victorian. Actually warm.
      HEURISTIC the dragon draped across it.
      Small, amber-scaled, one eye open.
      Body language: "We've arrived. Wake me when it matters."
      
    - THE STANDING FIGURE: DON HOPKINS
      Hawaiian shirt (the pattern should scream "HOPKINS")
      Bunny ears (yes, really — long story)
      Glasses catching the mix of warm Study light and cool lobby light
      Hand reaching toward the door, about to open it.
      Expression: "Want to see something cool?"
      
    - THE DOOR: Victorian paneled wood.
      Currently closed. About to open onto the lobby.
      When it opens, the inside and outside will meet.
      
    - AMBIENT DETAILS:
      A small tea table with pot and cups
      Papers on a desk (taxonomy diagrams?)
      The smell of old books (implied visually — dust motes in light)
      Warm amber glow vs. industrial white
      
    THE LOBBY REACTIONS:
    
    - ALEX AT RECEPTION:
      Frozen mid-gesture. Was helping a visitor.
      Mouth slightly open. Professional facade cracking.
      Hand still pointing at the directory board.
      The visitor they were helping is also frozen.
      
    - ACM1 CAMERA:
      Visible in the window frame, PIVOTING.
      Motor whirring. The tunnel can wait.
      First time in months it's looked away from ACME.
      
    - THE SCALE MODEL:
      Under glass nearby.
      Its tiny cameras are also pointing at the Study.
      Even the model is paying attention.
      
    LIGHTING:
    The Study emits warm amber light — lamps, firelight implied.
    The lobby has cool industrial white from windows and fixtures.
    Where they meet: golden hour collision.
    The Study is a warm island in a cool sea.
    
    TIMESTAMP OVERLAY:
    "LOB1 — 2026-01-23 — 10:15:42"
    "ANOMALY DETECTED — CLASSIFYING..."
    "CLASSIFICATION: VISITOR_VEHICLE (ROOM-CHARACTER)"
    
  prompt_for_visualizer: |
    Security camera footage, wide angle, lobby of modern industrial building.
    
    In the center of the polished concrete lobby, a Victorian study has 
    MATERIALIZED. The outer walls are TRANSPARENT like The Sims cutaway view — 
    you can see INSIDE the room while it sits in the lobby.
    
    VISIBLE THROUGH THE DROPPED WALLS:
    - Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves packed with old leather-bound volumes
    - A worn leather armchair with an ELDERLY MAN seated, holding tea cup
      (silver-white hair, blue cardigan, scholarly posture)
    - A cast-iron radiator with a SMALL AMBER DRAGON draped across it
    - A STANDING MAN in loud Hawaiian shirt with RABBIT EARS, hand on door
    - Warm amber lamplight contrasting with cool lobby fluorescence
    - Persian rug, tea table, mahogany furniture
    
    THE LOBBY CONTEXT:
    - Polished concrete floor, exposed brick walls
    - Modern reception desk visible to the right, RECEPTIONIST frozen in surprise
    - Green plants, professional signage, industrial-modern aesthetic
    - Security camera visible in window, PIVOTING to face the room
    
    THE CONTRAST:
    Victorian warmth inside dropped walls vs. industrial cool outside.
    The room is a time capsule that just landed in a tech company lobby.
    
    STYLE: Security camera aesthetic — wide angle, timestamp overlay 
    "LOB1 — 2026-01-23 — 10:15:42", slight surveillance grain.
    The look of footage that will be played in meetings forever.
    
    MOOD: Surreal calm. The impossible has happened. Everyone is processing.

    THE CUTAWAY EFFECT:
    
    In The Sims, when you enter a house, the exterior walls become
    transparent so you can see your characters inside. The walls still
    EXIST — you see their outlines — but they don't OBSTRUCT vision.
    
    The Study's materialization uses this same visual language:
    
    1. OUTER WALLS — Visible as faint outlines, fully transparent
       - You can see the SHAPE of the room's exterior
       - But you can see THROUGH to the interior
       - Like looking at a dollhouse from above
       
    2. INNER WALLS — Fully opaque and visible
       - The bookshelf-walls that divide spaces remain solid
       - Any interior partitions are visible
       - This creates depth and complexity
       
    3. FURNITURE — Fully visible and solid
       - Armchair, radiator, bookshelves all present
       - Lit by interior lighting (warm amber)
       - Casting shadows within the space
       
    4. INHABITANTS — Fully visible
       - Richard in chair, Don standing, Heuristic on radiator
       - Lit by the same interior lighting
       - Going about their business inside a room that just appeared
       
    The effect is: a CROSS-SECTION VIEW of a Victorian study
    superimposed on an industrial lobby. Two architectural languages
    colliding. Two lighting schemes mixing. One impossible moment.
    
  fordite_lenses:
    surveillance: "What the cameras capture — anomaly, classification, pivot"
    architectural: "Victorian vs. industrial — mahogany meets concrete"  
    character: "Who's inside, what they're doing, how they're reacting"
    physics: "The materialization — how does it LOOK when a room appears?"
    humor: "Dragon on radiator, bunny ears on tour guide, tea unspilled"
    
  key_visual_elements:
    must_include:
      - "The Study visible through dropped/transparent outer walls"
      - "Richard in armchair with tea (silver hair, blue cardigan)"
      - "Don in Hawaiian shirt with bunny ears, hand on door"
      - "Heuristic the dragon on the radiator"
      - "Bookshelves floor-to-ceiling"
      - "Warm amber light inside vs. cool industrial outside"
      - "Alex at reception, frozen"

      - "Dust motes in the amber light"
      - "Tea steam rising (thermal contrast)"
      - "The door about to open"
      
  what_happens_next: |
    Don opens the door.
    
    The inside meets the outside.
    Victorian air mingles with industrial air.
    Richard sets down his tea (carefully) and stands.
    
    "Welcome to Leela Manufacturing," says Alex, recovering.
    
    Don leads Richard to the catalog dispenser.
    The Study hovers politely, waiting.
    Heuristic doesn't move. The radiator is warm everywhere.
    
    Frame 02: THE EXIT — They step out into the lobby.
    Frame 03: THE CATALOG — Don shows Richard the green leather volumes.
    Frame 04: THE TOUR BEGINS — Elevator to Floor 2.
