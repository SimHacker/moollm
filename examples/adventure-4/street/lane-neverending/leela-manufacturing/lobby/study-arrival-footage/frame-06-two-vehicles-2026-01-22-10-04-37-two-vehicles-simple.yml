  A large modern industrial lobby with a high-gloss grey floor. Two vehicles are parked side-by-side: a Victorian study with mahogany walls and book-filled shelves (left), and a sleek white 1970s FMC motorcoach with blue/white stripes (right). An elderly man with silver hair and a navy blue cardigan stands by the study door, beckoning inside. A man with grey rabbit ears and a bright red Hawaiian shirt stands by the motorcoach door, beckoning inside. A small amber dragon is visible inside the study. Large potted palms and high-tech blue signs in the background. Cinematic lighting, sharp detail.
