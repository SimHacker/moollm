  LOB1 security camera footage, wide-angle surveillance perspective, timestamped 10:45:12. The scene captures the modern, high-gloss grey-floored lobby of Leela, filled with a vibrant, messy, and celebratory atmosphere. Reflections of colorful food and vehicles shimmer on the polished floor.
  
  Near the gleaming white and blue FMC Motorcoach, Don Hopkins, sporting whimsical rabbit ears, a red hibiscus-patterned Hawaiian shirt, khaki shorts, and sandals, is joyfully directing a massive green watermelon toward the open door of the vehicle. He's balancing an additional crate of watermelons, perfectly round and vibrant green, in his arms, his rabbit ears twitching with hunger as he maneuvers the unwieldy load. His posture is slightly strained but his expression is one of eager anticipation.
  
  Beside the mahogany-paneled Victorian Study, Dr. Richard Bartle, a distinguished figure with gold-rimmed glasses perched on his nose and a navy blue cardigan sweater over a crisp white shirt, oversees the careful placement of a large, steaming white platter of spaghetti and meatballs. The spaghetti is generously coated in a deep red sauce, studded with massive, savory meatballs. He's glancing toward the amber dragon statue positioned near the Study door, a look of mild concern on his face. His grey slacks are neatly pressed, and he wears brown leather loafers.
  
  Adding to the organized chaos are Dolly and Lolly, operating forklifts. Dolly, in a bright yellow forklift adorned with fluffy pink dice hanging from the rearview mirror, is lifting a pallet stacked high with silver trays overflowing with tacos and enormous blocks of bright orange cheddar cheese. The tacos are generously filled with a colorful assortment of ingredients—shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, seasoned ground beef, and melted cheese—arranged artfully in the silver trays. The cheddar cheese blocks are stacked into a precarious pyramid, resembling gold bullion. Dolly herself is unseen, only hands visible on the controls, wearing driving gloves.
  
  Lolly, in a pink forklift embellished with strands of faux pearls draped around the steering column, is carrying a tray laden with several large, glazed hams. The hams are a rich honey-tone, glistening under the artificial lights of the lobby. More platters of spaghetti are stacked precariously next to the hams. Lolly wears a sparkling pink helmet.
  
  The amber dragon statue, with intricate scales and piercing golden eyes, has moved slightly from its usual position, its snout inquisitively sniffing the air near the Study door, seemingly drawn by the enticing aroma of the feast. Its posture is alert, its tail slightly raised.
  
  The Victorian Study's mahogany door is partially open, revealing a glimpse of the dimly lit interior filled with shelves of aged books and antique furniture. The FMC Motorcoach's side door is open, revealing comfortable seating, gleaming chrome accents, and high-tech control panels within.
  
  The high-gloss grey floors amplify the scene's vibrancy, reflecting the colorful food, vehicles, and characters like a distorted mirror. The overall scene is busy, disorganized, yet brimming with a sense of joyful camaraderie and anticipation for the adventure ahead. The lighting is bright and even, typical of a modern office lobby, with no harsh shadows.
