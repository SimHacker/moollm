  A large modern lobby with two robotic forklifts delivering crates. One forklift is yellow and weathered with fluffy dice, heading toward a white 1970s motorcoach. The other is bright pink with a pearl necklace on its roll cage, stopping by a Victorian mahogany study. An elderly man with silver hair and a navy cardigan looks at a small floating silver orb. A man with rabbit ears and a red Hawaiian shirt pats the yellow forklift. High-gloss grey floor, golden light, cinematic details.
