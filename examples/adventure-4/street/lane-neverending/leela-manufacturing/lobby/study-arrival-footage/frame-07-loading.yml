    The pioneers have beckoned, and Leela has answered.
    
    From the cargo elevators, two distinct robotic forklifts emerge, 
    laden with gold-embossed Leela crates. 
    
    DOLLY (yellow, dented, fluffy dice) is carrying a pallet of 
    high-tech infrastructure: Self-Healing Modules and a 
    Predictive Maintenance array for the FMC's 440 V8.
    
    LOLLY (pink, pristine, wearing a pearl necklace on her roll cage) 
    is delivering the specialized gear for the Study: a Pocket 
    Dimension Container and a crate of Paradox-Safe Shelves.
    
    Don is cheering as Dolly approaches his motorcoach. Richard is 
    examining a floating Omniscient Orb that Lolly has brought up.

    - DOLLY: The veteran yellow forklift, maneuvering toward the FMC's 
      open engine bay. Beeping authoritatively.
    - LOLLY: A newer, bright pink forklift with a string of oversized 
      faux-pearls on her cage. She's stopping by the Study door.
    - THE HAUL:
      - A keychain-sized 'Pocket Dimension Container' glowing violet.
      - Sleek 'Self-Healing Modules' with green status lights.
      - A floating 'Omniscient Orb' hovering near Richard's head.
      - Sturdy crates with 'LEELA MANUFACTURING' stenciled on the sides.
    - ACTION: Don is high-fiving (paw-fiving) Dolly's roll cage. 
      Richard is adjusting his glasses to look at the Orb.
    - BACKGROUND: The Study and FMC side-by-side, still glowing.
