  - layer: vehicular_duality
    detail: |
      Two vastly different architectural languages are now sharing the 
      lobby floor. The Study is vertical, woody, and ornate. The FMC 
      is horizontal, sleek, and industrial-futuristic (for 1976).
    visual_evidence: "Mahogany box beside a shimmering 30-foot fiberglass wedge."

    richard: |
      He has moved closer to his Study door, looking at the appearing 
      motorcoach with a look of technical appreciation. He still hasn't 
      set down his tea.
    don: |
      His hands are outstretched, palm-up, as if presenting the 
      motorcoach to Richard. The grey rabbit ears are tilted at a 
      congratulatory angle.
    heuristic: |
      The dragon's amber scales are reflecting the shimmering 
      interference pattern of the materializing FMC through the 
      Study's dropped walls.

  - layer: emerging_fmc_details
    detail: |
      The FMC #898 features a prominent blue stripe along the middle 
      of its white shell. The panoramic 'brow' windshield looks like 
      a futuristic helmet.
    emergent_detail: "Chrome wheel covers glint through the transparency."

narrative_consequences:
  - "The FMC #898 is now a co-occupant of the Leela Manufacturing lobby."
  - "The 'Double Materialization' event has maxed out the LOB1 anomaly logs."
  - "Richard and Don are now officially a two-vehicle convoy."
