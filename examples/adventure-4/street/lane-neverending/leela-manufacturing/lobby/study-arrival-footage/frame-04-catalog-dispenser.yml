    Don has led Richard across the high-gloss grey floor to the 
    Leela Catalog Dispenser. Richard, in his navy cable-knit cardigan, 
    is holding an open Edition 47 catalog (dark green leather). 
    He is studying the 'TomTomagotchi' diagram with amusement.
    
    Don (tomato-red hibiscus shirt, fuzzy grey ears) is pointing at 
    the page, explaining the emotional stakes of navigation.
    
    In the background, the Study is parked with its door open.
    The brass globe glints, and the amber dragon is visible 
    through the dropped walls, ignoring a stunned human visitor 
    who is staring at the room.

    A scholarly man with silver hair and a navy blue cable-knit 
    cardigan is holding open a thick, dark green leather-bound 
    catalog with gold embossing. He is wearing reading glasses 
    and smiling with amusement. 
    
    Beside him, a man with long grey-white fuzzy rabbit ears and 
    a vibrant tomato-red Hawaiian shirt with white hibiscus 
    flowers is pointing at a diagram in the catalog. 
    
    They are standing in a large, modern lobby with high-gloss grey 
    floors. In the background, a cozy Victorian study with 
    mahogany walls and colorful bookshelves is sitting in the 
    middle of the floor. The walls of the study are transparent 
    like a dollhouse, revealing a burgundy Persian rug and a 
    brass globe. 
    
    A small amber dragon is visible inside the study, curled 
    on a white radiator. A stunned human visitor in the background 
    is staring at the study in disbelief. High-tech blue digital 
    signs and large potted palms are visible in the lobby.
    
    STYLE: Wide angle, high detail, sharp focus. The warm golden 
    light of the catalog area contrasts with the cool lobby.
