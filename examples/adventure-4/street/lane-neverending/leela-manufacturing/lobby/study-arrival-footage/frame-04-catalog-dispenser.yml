    Don has led Richard to the Leela Catalog Dispenser. 
    Richard is holding an open Edition 47 catalog, bound in 
    dark green leather. He's studying the 'TomTomagotchi' entry.
    
    Don is gesturing toward the catalog with a delighted grin. 
    "It has emotional stakes, Richard! It's navigation as a game!"
    
    Alex is in the background, now helping a normal visitor who 
    is staring at the Study with open-mouthed confusion.
    
    Inside the Study (visible in background), Heuristic has 
    un-curled slightly and is watching the visitor from the radiator.

      Edition 47 catalogs stacked neatly inside.
    - DON: One hand on the dispenser, the other pointing at 
      Richard's open catalog. Hawaiian shirt colors popping.
    - RICHARD: Reading with scholarly amusement. He's found the 
      'Factorio Protocols' section too.
    - THE STUDY: Parked nearby, walls dropped, glowing warm amber.

    ACTION:
    - Dr. RICHARD BARTLE stands holding an open, dark green leather catalog. He is wearing reading glasses and has a look of focused interest.
    - DON HOPKINS (rabbit, Hawaiian shirt) is beside him, pointing at a page in the catalog and smiling broadly.
    - In the background, the Victorian Study is still visible with its "Sims style" dropped walls.
    - A confused human visitor is visible in the distance, staring at the Study.
    
    STYLE: Surveillance camera detail, 10:17:42 timestamp. High contrast between the dark green catalog and the bright lobby.
