Security camera footage (LOB1), wide angle. The Victorian Study is now 100% solid and anchored in the center of the Leela Manufacturing lobby. The outer walls remain transparent in a "The Sims" cutaway style, showing the rich interior detail against the industrial lobby.

INTERIOR DETAILS (THROUGH DROPPED WALLS):
- Dr. RICHARD BARTLE stands up from his high-back leather armchair. He is wearing a blue cardigan and has a scholarly, amused expression.
- DON HOPKINS (anthropomorphic rabbit in a loud tie-dye Hawaiian shirt) is standing by the Study's wooden door, doorknob in hand, looking at Richard with a "behold!" gesture.
- HEURISTIC (the small amber dragon) is sitting alert on the cast-iron radiator, staring intensely at the camera lens (LOB1).
- The bookshelves are packed; several open books are scattered on the mahogany desk.

LOBBY CONTEXT:
- The polished concrete floor reflects the mahogany furniture of the Study.
- ALEX (the receptionist) is visible at the desk, halfway between shock and a professional welcome, reaching for a visitor badge.
- Cool industrial white light from the lobby ceiling mixes with the warm amber glow of the Study's interior lamps.

STYLE: Surveillance camera perspective, slightly elevated. Timestamp: "LOB1 — 2026-01-23 — 10:15:47". Green digital overlays/bounding boxes from the security system identify the characters as "VISITOR" and the dragon as "ANOMALY".
