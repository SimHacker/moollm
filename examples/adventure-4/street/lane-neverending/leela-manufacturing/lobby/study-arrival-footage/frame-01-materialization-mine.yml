fordite_layers:

  - layer: architectural_collision
    detail: |
      The juxtaposition of 19th-century mahogany and 21st-century polished
      concrete is stark. The Study isn't just "in" the lobby; it's 
      transcluding its own reality into the space. The "Sims walls" 
      effect creates a perfect cross-section.
    visual_evidence: "Mahogany floor meets concrete with no transition gap."

  - layer: character_presence
    richard: "Unfazed. The steam from his tea is captured in 4K, rising in a steady plume."
    don: "The bunny ears are distinctly tilted forward in excitement. The Hawaiian shirt pattern is 'Hawaiian-Industrial' (gears and palm trees)."
    heuristic: "The dragon's scales have a metallic amber sheen that catches the lobby's fluorescent lights through the transparent walls."
    alex: "Hands are halfway to a 'what the...?' gesture. Perfect comedic timing."

  - layer: anomaly_detection_ui
    detail: |
      The LOB1 overlay has drawn a bounding box around the dragon.
      LABEL: [ENTITY: UNKNOWN_REPTILE (GLOWING)]
      PROBABILITY: 0.98
      ACTION: LOG_EVENT
    note: "The AI doesn't know it's a dragon, but it knows it's an anomaly."

  - layer: lighting_synthesis
    detail: |
      The warm amber light from the Study's desk lamp spills out onto
      the concrete, creating a 'golden hour' puddle in the middle of
      the sterile lobby.
    emergent_detail: "Dust motes from the old books are visible in the amber beam."

  - layer: camera_mechanics
    detail: "ACM1 is visible in the background window, its lens reflecting the Study. It is physically mid-rotation."

narrative_consequences:
  - "The Study is now anchored in the Leela namespace."
  - "The dragon is officially on the security logs."
  - "Alex will need to update the visitor registration form to include 'Rooms'."
