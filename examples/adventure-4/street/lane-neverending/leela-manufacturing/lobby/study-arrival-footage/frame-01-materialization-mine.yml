    detail: |
      The Study appears as a self-contained island of mahogany and books
      resting on a sleek, light-grey industrial floor. The high ceilings 
      of the lobby dwarf the room, making it look like a precious 
      artifact under display.
    visual_evidence: "Sharp line where Victorian wood meets modern grey tiles/concrete."

    richard: |
      Seated deeply in the leather wingback chair. He's wearing a 
      comfortable-looking blue cardigan. He holds his tea cup with both 
      hands, looking perfectly at ease with the displacement.
    don: |
      Standing in a dynamic pose near the door. The rabbit ears are 
      prominent and greyish-white. The Hawaiian shirt has a vibrant 
      red-orange pattern that vibrates against the Study's mahogany.
    heuristic: |
      Sitting upright on a white cast-iron radiator. The dragon's 
      amber scales catch the interior lamp-glow. It looks remarkably 
      solid and attentive.
    alex: "Alex is partially visible in the background, obscured by the Study's frame, adding to the voyeuristic feel."

  - layer: emergent_objects
    detail: |
      A brass globe stands in the corner of the Study, reflecting the 
      dual light sources. The bookshelves are not just full; they are 
      teeming with colorful spines that suggest a vast taxonomy of knowledge.
    note: "The globe implies that the Study carries its own map of the world."

  - layer: lighting_synthesis
    detail: |
      The 'Sims walls' effect creates a beautiful cross-section of 
      color temperatures. The interior is a rich, saturated gold, 
      while the lobby outside is a sterile, airy white/blue.
    emergent_detail: "The Study's shadow on the lobby floor is unusually long and dark."

narrative_consequences:
  - "The globe is now a canon artifact — perhaps it maps the microworld?"
  - "Richard's blue cardigan is the definitive Bartle-wear for this sequence."
  - "The 'island' nature of the Study emphasizes its role as a vehicle."
