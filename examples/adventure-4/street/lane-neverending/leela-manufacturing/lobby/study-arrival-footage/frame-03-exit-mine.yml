fordite_layers:

  - layer: threshold_physics
    detail: |
      The transition between mahogany and concrete is a literal
      seam in reality. There is a slight 'shimmer' at the door's 
      threshold, like heat haze.
    visual_evidence: "Richard's trailing foot looks slightly distorted as it crosses the line."

  - layer: character_detail
    don: "His tie-dye laces are glowing purple (UV reactive?). He looks ready to sprint through the factory."
    richard: "Holding a small, gold-embossed leather notebook. Emergent detail: the title says 'PLAYER TAXONOMY — VOL IV'."
    alex: "Wearing a name tag that says 'Welcome' (as mentioned in the ROOM.yml). She looks genuinely glad to see them."

  - layer: the_dragon_factor
    detail: |
      Heuristic has tucked his head under his tail. 
      The LOB1 system has updated its classification.
      LABEL: [ENTITY: ANOMALY_SLEEPING]
      THREAT_LEVEL: ZERO
    note: "The AI is becoming comfortable with the dragon."

  - layer: lighting_collision
    detail: "The cool lobby light is being partially blocked by the open Study door, creating a long, dark mahogany-shaped shadow that reaches almost to the reception desk."

narrative_consequences:
  - "The 'transclusion threshold' at the door is stable."
  - "Richard is bringing his latest research notes into the Leela context."
  - "Alex's name ('Welcome') is now visually canonized."
