      Crossing the threshold. His navy blue cardigan has a visible 
      cable-knit texture. He holds the white tea cup steadily as he 
      transitions from wood to concrete.
    don: |
      Fully in the lobby now. His grey-white rabbit ears are alert and 
      slightly fuzzy. The tomato-red hibiscus shirt is the dominant 
      splash of color in the cool grey lobby. He is gesturing 
      enthusiastically toward the rest of the building.
    heuristic: |
      Visible deep inside the Study, still on the radiator. The dragon 
      is now curled in a ball, eyes closed, ignoring the world outside.

  - layer: threshold_geometry
    detail: |
      The boundary between the Study's burgundy Persian rug and the 
      lobby's high-gloss grey floor is perfectly straight. The Study 
      door is heavy mahogany with an ornate brass handle.
    visual_evidence: "Sharp transition in flooring material at the doorframe."

  - layer: lobby_evolution
    detail: |
      The lobby's background features a sleek digital directory sign 
      glowing with blue text. Large, architectural-scale potted palms 
      frame the transition area.
    note: "The digital sign adds a 'high-tech' counterpoint to the Study's 'low-tech' mahogany."

  - layer: emergent_objects
    detail: |
      A small stack of three leather-bound books is resting on the 
      Study's floor just inside the door, as if they were set down 
      during the 'packing' for this trip.
    visual_evidence: "Three distinct spines (green, red, brown) visible near the rug's edge."

narrative_consequences:
  - "Richard's cable-knit cardigan is now canon texture."
  - "The 'Transition Books' near the door imply the Study is a working environment."
  - "The high-gloss floor reflects the golden 'home' light, extending the Study's influence into the lobby."
