  - layer: the_lift_queens
    dolly: |
      The yellow paint is 'Industrial Amber.' The dent on the front 
      left corner is shaped like a crescent moon. The fluffy dice are 
      over-sized and a faded, fuzzy white.
    lolly: |
      Her pink is 'Candy-Shell Magenta.' The pearls are huge, about 
      the size of golf balls, and glint with a pearlescent luster 
      that contrasts with her utilitarian steel forks.

  - layer: character_interactions
    richard: |
      Looking at the floating orb with a 'so this is the future' 
      expression. The orb reflects the mahogany Study behind it.
    don: |
      One hand is on the FMC's side, the other is patting Dolly's 
      roll cage. He looks like a captain greeting his crew.

  - layer: emergent_products
    pocket_dimension: |
      The keychain container is a brilliant, faceted amethyst-purple. 
      It doesn't just glow; it seems to pull the light from the 
      surrounding air toward its center.
    omniscient_orb: |
      A smooth silver sphere, about 6 inches in diameter, floating 
      perfectly level with Richard's eye line. It has a single, 
      pulsing blue sensor 'eye'.

  - layer: logistical_details
    crates: |
      The 'LEELA MANUFACTURING' stencils are in a crisp, sans-serif 
      font. One crate is open, revealing the green status lights 
      of the Self-Healing Modules.
    floor_physics: |
      The reflections of the pink and yellow forklifts create a 
      vibrant, almost neon mix on the glossy grey concrete.

narrative_consequences:
  - "Lolly's pearls and Dolly's dice are now canonical character signatures."
  - "The Omniscient Orb's blue 'eye' is its primary interaction point."
  - "The 'Industrial Amber' and 'Candy-Shell Magenta' colors define the Leela logistics fleet."
