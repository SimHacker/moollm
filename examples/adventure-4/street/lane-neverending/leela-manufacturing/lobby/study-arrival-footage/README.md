## The Event

At approximately 10:15 UTC on January 23, 2026, LOB1 detected an anomaly
in the Leela Manufacturing lobby.

A Victorian study materialized in the center of the polished concrete floor.

The room's outer walls were **transparent** — visible as outlines but
see-through, exactly like the cutaway view in The Sims. Through the
dropped walls, the camera observed:

- Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves packed with leather-bound volumes
- A worn leather armchair (occupied)
- A cast-iron radiator (dragon-occupied)
- A standing figure in a Hawaiian shirt and bunny ears
- Warm amber light contrasting with industrial fluorescence

**Classification:** VISITOR_VEHICLE (ROOM-CHARACTER)  
**Badge Issued:** V-2026-0847  
**Notes:** First room to require parking validation

Outer walls become transparent.
Inner contents fully visible.
Two architectures collide.

## Personnel Reactions

**Alex (Reception):**
```
Initial: "Mr. Hopkins! You've... brought a room."
Recovery: "I'll log it as a visitor vehicle."
Later: "Do you need a badge for the... Study?"
```

**Visitor in lobby:**
```
"Is that... is that a DRAGON on the radiator?"
"I thought Leela was a tech company."
"Actually, this explains a lot."
```

## Occupants

| Entity | Location | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Richard Bartle | Armchair | Holding tea, unfazed |
| Don Hopkins | Standing by door | Bunny ears, delighted |
| Heuristic | Radiator | One eye open, warm |
| The Study | Hovering | Outer walls dropped |

---

## Key Observations

1. **State Preservation:** Richard's tea remained warm throughout transit
2. **Interior Lighting:** Warm amber persisted independent of exterior
3. **Dragon Protocol:** Heuristic did not move during materialization
4. **Wall Transparency:** Outer walls visible but see-through (The Sims effect)
5. **Professional Recovery:** Alex adapted within 8 seconds
