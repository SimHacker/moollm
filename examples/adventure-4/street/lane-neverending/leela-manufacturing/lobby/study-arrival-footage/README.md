## The Event

At approximately 10:15 UTC on January 23, 2026, LOB1 detected an anomaly
in the Leela Manufacturing lobby.

A Victorian study materialized in the center of the polished concrete floor.

The room's outer walls were **transparent** — visible as outlines but
see-through, exactly like the cutaway view in The Sims. Through the
dropped walls, the camera observed:

- Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves packed with leather-bound volumes
- A worn leather armchair (occupied)
- A cast-iron radiator (dragon-occupied)
- A standing figure in a Hawaiian shirt and bunny ears
- Warm amber light contrasting with industrial fluorescence

**Classification:** VISITOR_VEHICLE (ROOM-CHARACTER)  
**Badge Issued:** V-2026-0847  
**Notes:** First room to require parking validation

"Is that... is that a DRAGON on the radiator?"
"I thought Leela was a tech company."
"Actually, this explains a lot."
```
