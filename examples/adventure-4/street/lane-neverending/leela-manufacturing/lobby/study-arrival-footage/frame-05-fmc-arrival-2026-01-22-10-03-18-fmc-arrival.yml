  Security camera footage (LOB1), wide angle. Inside a large modern lobby with high ceilings and a high-gloss grey floor, a second vehicle is MATERIALIZING. Beside a fully-solid Victorian mahogany room with book-filled shelves, a sleek white 1970s FMC Motorcoach with blue and white stripes is appearing in a shimmering, semi-transparent state. An elderly man with silver hair and a navy blue cardigan is standing by the Victorian room's door. A man with grey rabbit ears and a bright red Hawaiian shirt is standing in the lobby center, gesturing at the appearing motorcoach. A small amber dragon is visible inside the Victorian room. Warm golden light from the room contrasts with cool lobby light. Timestamp overlay: LOB1 — 2026-01-23 — 10:22:15.
