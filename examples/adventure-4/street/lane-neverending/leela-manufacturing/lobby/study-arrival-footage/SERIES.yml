# 🎥 THE STUDY ARRIVES — First Mobile Room-Character Landing
#
# SOURCE: LOB1 "Front Eye" — Lobby interior camera, Leela Manufacturing
# SECONDARY: ACM1 "Tunnel Watcher" — Pivots from ACME to catch the action
# CAPTURES: A Victorian study materializing in an industrial lobby.
#           With people inside it. And a dragon.
#
# PARTICIPANTS:
#   - The Study (mobile room-character-vehicle, freshly TARDIS-enabled)
#   - Richard Bartle (inside the Study, at home wherever it lands)
#   - Don Hopkins (full access pass, tour guide)
#   - Heuristic (dragon, on the radiator, unfazed)
#   - Alex (reception, professionally confused)
#
# VISUAL CONCEPT: The Sims cutaway
#   - Outer walls of the Study drop/fade away
#   - Inner walls remain visible
#   - We see INSIDE the room as it materializes in the lobby
#   - Victorian furniture, bookshelves, armchairs — in an industrial space
#   - Characters visible inside, stepping out into the lobby
#
# THEME: "You've... brought a room."

  cameras:
    lob1:
      id: LOB1
      name: "Front Eye"
      location: "Lobby, above directory board"
      purpose: "Watches entrance, visitors, events"
      view: "Interior lobby, full coverage"
      role: "PRIMARY — captures the materialization"
      
    acm1:
      id: ACM1
      name: "Tunnel Watcher"
      location: "Lobby window, facing north (normally)"
      purpose: "Monitors ACME painted tunnel"
      view: "Usually exterior, but can PIVOT"
      role: "SECONDARY — swings around to see what just appeared"
      behavior: |
        ACM1's normal job is watching the painted tunnel across the street.
        But when something THIS anomalous happens behind it...
        The camera pivots. Slowly. Dramatically.
        Like it can't quite believe what its sensors are reporting.

    VISUAL LANGUAGE:
    - The Sims cutaway perspective
    - Outer walls of the Study are transparent/dropped
    - Inner walls, furniture, inhabitants VISIBLE
    - Industrial lobby contrasts with Victorian interior
    - Security camera timestamp overlays
    
    THE STUDY'S APPEARANCE:
    - Materializes from faint outline to solid
    - Books first (they're the heaviest, philosophically)
    - Then furniture, then walls, then occupants
    - Or: all at once with a soft WHOMP of displaced air
    - Warm light spills out, contrasting with industrial fluorescence
    
    THE SIMS EFFECT:
    - Imagine the camera is "inside" the lot
    - Outer walls peel away or become glass
    - We see the cross-section: study interior + lobby exterior
    - Richard in armchair, Don standing, Heuristic on radiator
    - All visible through the opened walls
    - They're INDOORS (in the Study) and INDOORS (in the lobby)
    
    COMPOSITION:
    - LOB1: Wide shot, Study materialized center-left
    - Reception desk and Alex visible right
    - Catalog dispenser visible background
    - Scale model under glass nearby
    - The contrast: mahogany vs. polished concrete

    commentary: |
      "Mr. Hopkins! You've... brought a room."
      
      "Is that... is that a dragon on the radiator?"
      
      "I'll log it as a visitor vehicle. Do you need a badge?"
