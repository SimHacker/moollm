    Don opens the heavy wooden Study door. It swings open into
    the lobby space with a satisfying mahogany creak.
    
    Don steps out first, his combat boots (with tie-dye laces) 
    clacking on the polished concrete. Richard follows, adjusting 
    his cardigan, looking around the industrial space with 
    polite curiosity.
    
    Alex at the reception desk has stood up, professional 
    composure fully restored. "Welcome back, Mr. Hopkins. 
    And welcome to Dr. Bartle... and your... home."
    
    Inside the Study (still visible through dropped walls), 
    Heuristic stays on the radiator. It has no intention of 
    leaving the warmth for a cold concrete floor.

    - THE DOORWAY: A portal between two worlds. The warm amber 
      light of the Study spills out in a triangle across the 
      grey floor.
    - DON: Waving to Alex. "Alex! This is Richard. He's touring 
      the factory today."
    - RICHARD: Stepping over the threshold. He's looking at 
      the Leela logo on the wall.
    - BACKGROUND: The Study hovers, a silent companion. Heuristic
      is curled up, watching them leave.
