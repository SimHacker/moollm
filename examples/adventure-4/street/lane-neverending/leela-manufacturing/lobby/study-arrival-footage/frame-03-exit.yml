    Don has opened the mahogany door. He steps out onto the lobby's 
    grey floor, looking back and waving for Richard to follow.
    Richard is crossing the threshold, one foot on his Persian rug,
    the other on the industrial concrete. He looks intrigued.
    The dragon remains on the warm radiator.

      looking up at the lobby's ceiling.

    A man with rabbit ears and a vibrant tomato-red Hawaiian shirt with 
    white flowers is stepping out of a dark mahogany door into a large, 
    modern lobby with grey floors and high ceilings. He is smiling and 
    waving for someone to follow him.
    
    Behind him, an elderly man with silver hair and a navy blue cardigan 
    is stepping through the doorway from a cozy room onto the concrete 
    lobby floor.
    
    The room they are leaving is a Victorian study with walls filled 
    with colorful books and a rich burgundy Persian rug on the floor. 
    Through the open door, warm golden light spills out in a triangle 
    onto the cool grey lobby floor.
    
    In the background of the cozy room, a small amber dragon sits on 
    a radiator. In the far background of the lobby, large potted plants 
    are visible.
    
    STYLE: Wide angle, cinematic lighting, sharp detail. The contrast 
    between the Victorian doorway and the modern lobby is striking.
