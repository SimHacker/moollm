Security camera footage (LOB1), medium-wide angle. The heavy mahogany door of the Victorian Study has swung open, and the passengers are stepping out into the industrial lobby of Leela Manufacturing.

ACTION:
- DON HOPKINS (anthropomorphic rabbit in a tie-dye Hawaiian shirt and combat boots) has just stepped onto the polished concrete floor. He is waving enthusiastically at the receptionist.
- Dr. RICHARD BARTLE (silver hair, blue cardigan) is stepping through the doorway, crossing the threshold from the Study's Persian rug to the lobby's concrete. He is looking up at the Leela Manufacturing logo with scholarly interest.
- ALEX (the receptionist) is now standing, professionally poised, holding out two lanyard badges.

THE STUDY (Background):
- The Study remains in place, its outer walls still transparent (The Sims style).
- HEURISTIC (the small amber dragon) remains inside, curled up on the cast-iron radiator, watching the disembarkation with one lazy eye.
- Warm amber light spills out of the open door in a sharp triangular beam across the lobby floor.

STYLE: High-resolution surveillance camera, timestamp: "LOB1 — 2026-01-23 — 10:15:57". Green digital overlays track the "DISEMBARK" movement.
