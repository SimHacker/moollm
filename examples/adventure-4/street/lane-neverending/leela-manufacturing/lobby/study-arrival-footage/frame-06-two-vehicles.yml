    Both vehicles are now 100% solid, anchored side-by-side in 
    the Leela lobby. A 19th-century study and a 20th-century 
    motorcoach, side-by-side. 
    
    The pioneers of virtual worlds and consciousness programming 
    have become their environments. Richard stands by the open 
    mahogany door of his Study, gesturing inside. Don stands 
    by the passenger door of his FMC #898, gesturing inside. 
    
    They are inviting each other — and the world — into their 
    respective portable sanctuaries.

    Wide angle view of a large modern industrial lobby with high-gloss 
    grey floors and high ceilings. 
    
    TWO MOBILE VEHICLES ARE PARKED SIDE-BY-SIDE:
    1. A VICTORIAN STUDY (left): Dark mahogany walls, book-filled 
       shelves, warm golden light. The door is open.
    2. AN FMC MOTORCOACH (right): 30-foot white fiberglass 1970s RV 
       with blue and white stripes and chrome wheel covers. The 
       passenger door is open.
    
    THE PIONEERS:
    - Dr. RICHARD BARTLE (silver hair, navy cable-knit cardigan) 
      stands by the Study door, beckoning inside. He holds a tea cup.
    - DON HOPKINS (with long fuzzy grey rabbit ears and a tomato-red 
      Hawaiian shirt) stands by the Motorcoach door, beckoning inside.
    
    IN BACKGROUND:
    - An amber dragon is visible through the Study's transparent walls.
    - Large potted palms and high-tech blue digital signage.
    - The industrial lobby light contrasts with the warm golden 
      interiors of both vehicles.
    
    STYLE: Wide angle, cinematic lighting, sharp detail. A moment of 
    mutual invitation and architectural wonder.
