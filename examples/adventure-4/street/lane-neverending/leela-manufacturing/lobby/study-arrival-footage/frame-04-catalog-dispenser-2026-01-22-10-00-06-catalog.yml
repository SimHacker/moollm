  A scholarly man with silver hair and a navy blue cable-knit cardigan is holding open a thick, dark green leather-bound catalog with gold embossing. He is wearing reading glasses and smiling with amusement. Beside him, a man with long grey-white fuzzy rabbit ears and a vibrant tomato-red Hawaiian shirt with white hibiscus flowers is pointing at a diagram in the catalog. They are standing in a large, modern lobby with high-gloss grey floors. In the background, a cozy Victorian study with mahogany walls and colorful bookshelves is sitting in the middle of the floor. The walls of the study are transparent like a dollhouse, revealing a burgundy Persian rug and a brass globe. A small amber dragon is visible inside the study, curled on a white radiator. A stunned human visitor in the background is staring at the study in disbelief. High-tech blue digital signs and large potted palms are visible in the lobby. Wide angle, high detail, sharp focus.
