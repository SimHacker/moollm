      The scale of the feast is unprecedented for a lobby event. The
      cheddar cheese pyramid is particularly striking, with the 
      individual blocks having a high-gloss, slightly oily sheen 
      consistent with high-quality sharp cheddar. 
    visual_evidence: "Orange pyramid on Dolly's pallet is approx. 3 feet tall."

      His rabbit ears are tilted forward, almost touching the 
      watermelon he's carrying. The red hibiscus shirt matches the 
      red of the spaghetti sauce, creating a visual 'flavor' link.

      He is holding the spaghetti platter with a level of care usually 
      reserved for ancient manuscripts. He is wearing a new accessory: 
      a white linen napkin tucked into his navy cardigan.

      The dragon's nostrils are visibly flared in the 4K capture. Its 
      amber scales look warmer, possibly reflecting the heat from the 
      steaming spaghetti.

      The silver taco trays reflect the lobby's blue digital signage, 
      giving the tacos a slightly neon, 'cyber-street-food' appearance.
    note: "The tacos appear to be 'authentic-industrial' style."

    detail: |
      The FMC's passenger door shows a glimpse of a custom 'Carrot 
      Cooler' being installed near the cockpit. The Study's door 
      reveals a small mahogany 'Spaghetti Sideboard' has been cleared 
      among the books.

narrative_consequences:
  - "Richard's 'Cardigan Napkin' is now canon dining protocol."
  - "The Study now has a designated food-handling area (the Sideboard)."
  - "The dragon has developed a taste for Italian-Victorian fusion."
