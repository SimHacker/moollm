fordite_layers:

  - layer: character_continuity
    richard: |
      His reading glasses are thin-rimmed and gold, matching the Study's 
      brass globe. The scholarly amusement is clear in his posture — 
      he is leaning slightly toward the catalog.
    don: |
      The 'Tomato-Red Hibiscus' shirt remains perfectly consistent. 
      The fuzzy grey-white ears are bent forward in an 'intense 
      explaining' posture.
    heuristic: |
      Barely visible in the background, but the metallic amber scales 
      still provide a distinct glint against the white radiator.

  - layer: catalog_interface
    detail: |
      The catalog is thick, with several hundred pages visible in 
      cross-section. The diagram Richard is studying looks like a 
      circular interface (a pie menu prototype?).
    visual_evidence: "Gold-embossed '47' visible on the dark green spine."

  - layer: emergent_visitor
    detail: |
      The stunned visitor in the background is wearing a neon yellow 
      safety vest over a grey jumpsuit. This implies they are likely 
      a member of the facility's maintenance or logistics crew.
    note: "The contrast between the casual 'veterans' and the shocked 
      'maintenance crew' underscores the high-clearance nature of the visit."

  - layer: reflection_mapping
    detail: |
      The high-gloss lobby floor shows a distinct red-and-white 
      reflection of Don's hibiscus shirt, anchoring him solidly 
      in the industrial space.
    visual_evidence: "Diffuse red reflection beneath Don's combat boots."

narrative_consequences:
  - "The 'pie menu' diagram in the catalog bridges the gap between 
    Richard's taxonomy and Don's interface design."
  - "The 'Maintenance Crew' (yellow vests) are now part of the lobby's 
    social ecosystem."
  - "Richard's gold-rimmed glasses are now canon equipment."
