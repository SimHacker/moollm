      The open page shows the 'TomTomagotchi' diagram. 
      Emergent detail: The TomTomagotchi icon is a small, 
      smiling egg with eyes. The text below it says: 
      'FEEDS ON MAP DATA. CRIES WHEN LOST.'
    visual_evidence: "Clearly legible text on the left-hand page."

    richard: "His expression has shifted from curiosity to recognition. He looks like he's found a kindred design spirit."
    don: "His ears are bent forward at a sharp angle — the 'Intense Explaining' pose. A small carrot stick is tucked behind one ear (rabbit-style pencil storage)."
    heuristic: "Visible in the background Study window. He's pressing his nose against the glass, watching the confused visitor."

    detail: |
      The 'confused visitor' is holding a cup of coffee.
      The coffee is visibly vibrating — his hand is shaking
      as he looks at the Study.
    note: "The contrast between the veterans (Don/Richard) and the normies is perfect."

    detail: |
      LOB1 has highlighted the 'confused visitor'.
      STATUS: CONFUSED_VISITOR

    note: "Leela's system is very helpful."

narrative_consequences:
  - "Don uses his ears as tool storage."
  - "Richard recognizes the 'TomTomagotchi' as a masterpiece of UX-play."
  - "The Study is now a permanent (temporary) part of the lobby's visual landscape."
