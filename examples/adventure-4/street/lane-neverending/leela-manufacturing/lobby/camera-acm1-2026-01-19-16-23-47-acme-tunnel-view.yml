  SECURITY CAMERA FOOTAGE — Camera ACM1 (Tunnel Watcher)
  Location: Leela Manufacturing Lobby Window, facing north
  Target: ACME Surplus Building, 4 Lane Neverending
  Time: Daytime, late afternoon golden hour

  THE VIEW:
  Security camera perspective, 1080p quality, slight surveillance camera aesthetic.
  Looking out the lobby window across Lane Neverending (a narrow Amsterdam-style street)
  at the shuttered ACME Surplus building.

  THE ACME BUILDING:
  An old industrial/commercial building, clearly abandoned but not demolished.
  Sign reads 'ACME SURPLUS' in faded red letters.
  Windows boarded up with weathered plywood.

  THE PAINTED TUNNEL:
  On the right side of the building, on a BOARDED-UP WINDOW, someone has painted
  a PERFECT TROMPE L'OEIL TUNNEL — a Road Runner style cartoon tunnel entrance!

  The painted tunnel shows:
  - Perfect perspective of a tunnel going into darkness
  - Railroad tracks leading in
  - Arched stone entrance
  - So realistic it looks 3D
  - But it's clearly painted on FLAT BOARDS

  THE EVIDENCE OF FAILURE:
  Around the painted tunnel:
  - Coyote-shaped silhouette pressed into the wall (cartoon style)
  - Tourist-shaped splat mark nearby
  - A Tesla Model S accordion pattern impact (car-shaped crumple impression)
  - Dust and debris from multiple impacts
  - The paint is slightly chipped from collisions

  THE FRONT WINDOW:
  The large unboarded front window shows glimpses of the interior:
  - Dusty shelves with ACME products
  - Faint smoke visible inside
  - Anvils stacked haphazardly
  - Boxes labeled 'ACME' with product names
  - Signs of recent activity (someone's been breaking in)

  THE STREET:
  Lane Neverending — narrow, cobblestone, Amsterdam style.
  A confused tourist is currently approaching the tunnel, hand extended...
  About to learn the lesson.

  In the distance, an ACME delivery truck approaches — it will pass THROUGH.
  (Cartoon physics works for insiders, not customers.)

  CAMERA OVERLAY:
  Security camera HUD elements:
  - 'ACM1' in corner
  - Timestamp: 2026-01-19 16:23:47
  - 'REC' indicator
  - Resolution: 1080p
  - Leela Manufacturing logo watermark

  LIGHTING:
  Late afternoon golden hour, warm light hitting the ACME building.
  Long shadows. The tunnel painting looks extra convincing in this light.
  That's why so many Teslas crash at this hour.

  STYLE:
  Security camera footage aesthetic.
  Slightly desaturated, surveillance quality.
  HUD overlays visible.
  Real enough to be evidence, weird enough to be Looney Tunes.

  MOOD: Darkly comic. This is a monument to failure. Every frame is a lesson.
  'This is what happens when you ship products that don't work.'
