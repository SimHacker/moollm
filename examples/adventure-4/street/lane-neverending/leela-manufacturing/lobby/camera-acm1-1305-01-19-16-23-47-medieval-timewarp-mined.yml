  the_eternal_lesson: |
    In 1304, a knight is about to learn what the Cybertruck learned in 2026:
    
    Painted gates are not real gates.
    
    The lance will strike wood, not air.
    The horse will stop. The knight will not.
    Physics applies to knights just as it applies to Teslas.
    
    722 years apart, the same lesson:
    "FSD doth not understand trompe l'oeil."
    "Ye Knight's Steed doth not understand trompe l'oeil."

# === TEMPORAL ARCHAEOLOGY ===

  continuity_confirmed:
    location: "Same spot, Lane Neverending"
    business: "ACME Surplus (or medieval equivalent)"
    trick: "Painted passage that isn't real"

  the_acme_curse: |
    ACME has existed for at least 722 years at this location.
    
    In every era:
    - They sell products that don't work
    - They paint solutions instead of building them
    - They blame the customer for believing
    - The wall always wins
    
    The curse is eternal. The lesson repeats.
    
  leela_eternal: |
    "LEELA MANUFACTURING" watermark visible in 1304.
    
    Leela has always been watching.
    Leela has always been documenting failures.
    Leela has always been learning.
    
    When ACME paints a fake gate, Leela builds a real one.
    When a knight bounces, Leela takes notes.
    
    722 years of competitive advantage through observation.

# === THE LESSON ===

philosophical_extraction:
  
  temporal_invariant: |
    The lesson transcends time:
    
    1304: Painted castle gate fools knights
    1952: Painted tunnel installed at ACME Surplus
    2026: Painted tunnel fools FSD/Cybertrucks
    
    The technology changes. The deception doesn't.
    The victims change. The wall doesn't.
    
    722 years of painted solutions.
    722 years of bouncing outsiders.
    722 years of the same lesson.
    
  the_eternal_wall: |
    The wall has been winning for 722 years.
    
    - Knights bounced in 1304
    - Tourists bounced in 2026
    - Cybertrucks crashed in 2026
    
    The wall is eternal.
    The paint is temporary.
    The lesson is permanent.
    
  acme_philosophy: |
    ACME's medieval motto (reconstructed):
    
    "Looketh real. Worketh not. Blameth customer."
    
    This philosophy has remained unchanged for 722 years.
    That's impressive commitment to failure.

# === MINING NOTES ===

mining_notes: |
  THE LESSON IS ETERNAL.
  
  722 years ago, at this exact spot:
  
  1. YE OLDE ACME SURPLUS sold questionable wares
  2. Someone painted a fake castle gate on the wall
  3. A knight is about to charge into it with a lance
  4. He's going to bounce just like the Cybertruck
  5. The wall always wins
  
  The temporal filter reveals:
  
  - ACME's curse predates modern technology by centuries
  - Painted solutions have always fooled outsiders
  - Leela has always been watching (and learning)
  - The wall is undefeated across 722 years
  
  Monty Python elements confirmed:
  - Dead cart, muddy peasants, chickens, knight on quest
  - The absurdist humor of medieval life
  - The theatrical low-budget aesthetic
  
  And somewhere, a squire is clapping coconuts together,
  pretending they're horse hooves.
  
  NI!
