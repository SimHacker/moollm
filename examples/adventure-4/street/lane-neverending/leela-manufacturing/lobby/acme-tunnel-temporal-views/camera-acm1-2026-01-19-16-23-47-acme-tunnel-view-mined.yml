# THE FRAME

frame_analysis:
  
  security_hud:
    elements_visible:
      - "ACM1 — Camera designation (top left)"
      - "REC — Recording indicator (top right, red)"
      - "2026-01-19 16:23:47 — Timestamp (bottom)"
      - "LEELA MANUFACTURING — Watermark (bottom right)"
      - "Tunnel Watcher — Camera name label (bottom)"
    authenticity: "Convincing security camera aesthetic"
    
  composition:
    perspective: "Street-level, looking across narrow lane"
    framing: "ACME building fills center, tunnel prominent"
    depth: "Near (tourist) → Middle (building) → Far (delivery truck)"

# THE ACME BUILDING

acme_surplus:
  
  signage:
    text: "ACME SURPLUS"
    condition: "Faded red letters, weathered"
    style: "Classic industrial signage"
    
  building_condition:
    status: "Shuttered but not demolished"
    architecture: "Old industrial/commercial, brick"
    windows: "Main display window unboarded, side windows boarded"
    entrance: "Locked, signs of break-in attempts"
    
  front_window:
    visible_contents:
      - "Dusty shelves"
      - "ACME products in boxes"
      - "Anvils stacked"
      - "Faint interior lighting"
    condition: "Grimy but intact"
    note: "This is where break-in activity is detected"

# THE PAINTED TUNNEL

painted_tunnel:
  
  location: "On boarded-up side window/wall"
  style: "Perfect trompe l'oeil — Road Runner cartoon style"
  
  visual_elements:
    arch: "Stone archway entrance, very realistic"
    tracks: "Railroad tracks leading into darkness"
    perspective: "Vanishing point creates 3D illusion"
    darkness: "Black tunnel interior painted realistically"
    
  craftsmanship:
    quality: "Masterful — convincing enough to fool FSD"
    age: "Painted in 1952 per camera-acm1.yml lore"
    condition: "Slightly chipped from impacts"
    
  the_paradox: |
    The tunnel WORKS for ACME insiders (delivery trucks pass through).
    The tunnel FAILS for everyone else (they bounce).
    
    This is the perfect metaphor for ACME's entire product line:
    Solutions that work for the company, not the customer.

# THE EVIDENCE OF FAILURE

impact_evidence:
  
  coyote_silhouette:
    visible: true
    location: "On wall near tunnel"
    style: "Classic cartoon impact — body pressed flat"
    note: "47 coyote-shaped silhouettes logged per ACM1 analytics"
    
  tourist_splat:
    implied: true
    note: "89 tourist silhouettes in analytics"
    
  tesla_accordion:
    mentioned_in_source: true
    note: "27 Tesla FSD collisions recorded — distinctive crumple pattern"
    lesson: "FSD does not understand trompe l'oeil"
    
  wall_damage:
    chipped_paint: true
    dust_debris: true
    note: "Cumulative evidence of 4,891 pedestrian bounces"

# THE SCENE

current_action:
  
  the_tourist:
    position: "Center of frame, walking toward tunnel"
    pose: "Hand extended toward painted wall"
    expression: "Confused/curious"
    prediction: "Will bounce in 2-3 seconds"
    note: |
      This is visitor #4,892.
      They all learn the same lesson.
      The tunnel doesn't work for customers.
      
  the_delivery_truck:
    position: "Background, approaching on cobblestones"
    type: "ACME delivery vehicle"
    prediction: "Will pass THROUGH the tunnel"
    note: |
      Cartoon physics works for insiders.
      This truck will phase through solid matter.
      The tourist will watch in disbelief.

# THE ENVIRONMENT

lane_neverending:
  type: "Narrow Amsterdam-style street"
  surface: "Cobblestones"
  width: "Single lane, pedestrian friendly"
  lighting: "Golden hour — late afternoon warmth"
  atmosphere: "European industrial district"
  
buildings:
  leela_manufacturing:
    position: "Behind camera (lobby window)"
    presence: "Implied by camera perspective and watermark"
    
  acme_surplus:
    position: "Directly ahead, center of frame"
    status: "Abandoned, monument to failure"
    
  neighboring_buildings:
    visible: true
    style: "Red brick industrial, matching Amsterdam aesthetic"

# THE LESSON

philosophical_extraction:
  
  the_tunnel_lesson: |
    "Don't paint solutions. Build them."
    
    The painted tunnel is a METAPHOR:
    - It LOOKS like a solution (perfect trompe l'oeil)
    - It WORKS for insiders (delivery trucks phase through)
    - It FAILS for customers (everyone else bounces)
    - It DECEIVES (Teslas believe it and crash)
    
    ACME sold products like this tunnel:
    Impressive demos, insider-only functionality, customer failure.
    
    Leela builds the OPPOSITE:
    Invisible infrastructure, universal functionality, customer success.
    
  daily_reminder: |
    Every Leela employee sees this feed.
    Every meeting starts with "What's the ACME tunnel teaching us today?"
    
    Answers vary:
    - "Magic only works for some people. Engineering works for everyone."
    - "If your product requires cartoon physics, rethink the product."
    - "Expectation management > painted solutions."
    
  the_tourist_lesson: |
    In 2-3 seconds, that tourist will learn:
    
    1. The wall is solid
    2. The tunnel was painted
    3. They believed a lie
    4. They're not an insider
    5. ACME doesn't care about them
    
    That moment of impact — that's what Leela prevents.
    We never let our customers hit the wall.

# MINING NOTES

mining_notes: |
  THIS IS WHAT FAILURE LOOKS LIKE.
  
  Every frame of ACM1 is evidence:
  
  1. THE PAINTED TUNNEL — Solutions that only work for insiders
  2. THE BOUNCING TOURIST — Customers learning the hard way
  3. THE PASSING TRUCK — Insiders don't experience the failure
  4. THE COYOTE SILHOUETTE — Cumulative evidence of deception
  5. THE TESLA CRASHES — Even AI can be fooled by painted solutions
  
  Leela watches this feed every day.
  Every day, the same lesson:
  
  "We build solutions that work for EVERYONE.
   Not painted tunnels that only work for delivery drivers."
  
  The tourist in this frame is about to become statistic #4,892.
  They'll peel themselves off the wall, confused and bruised.
  They'll never trust ACME again.
  
  Leela's job is to make sure nobody ever hits OUR wall.
  Because we don't paint walls. We build doors.
