  SECURITY CAMERA FOOTAGE — Camera ACM1 (Tunnel Watcher)
  TEMPORAL FILTER APPLIED: FUTURE — Years Forward: 8/10 (~2089 AD)
  Style: BLADE RUNNER / CYBERPUNK NOIR

  THE SCENE:
  A REPLICANT fleeing from a BLADE RUNNER, running toward the painted tunnel.
  The replicant thinks it's an escape route. The Blade Runner knows it's a trap.

  THE REPLICANT (NEXUS-9):
  - Running desperately toward the glowing tunnel
  - About to smash into the wall
  - Facial recognition targeting box visible

  THE BLADE RUNNER:
  - Pursuing in long coat, weapon drawn
  - Calm, methodical, waiting for the bounce
  - Knows the tunnel is fake

  THE TUNNEL (2089 version):
  - Bioluminescent cyan glow
  - Holographic depth projection
  - Looks MORE real than the 2026 version
  - But still just paint on a wall
  - "TUNNEL TRAP ACTIVE"

  BLADE RUNNER AESTHETIC:
  - Perpetual rain, neon reflections
  - Holographic geisha billboard
  - Japanese/English signage
  - Spinner in dark sky
  - Cyberpunk noir atmosphere
