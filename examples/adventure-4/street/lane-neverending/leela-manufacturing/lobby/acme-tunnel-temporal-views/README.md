# 📹 ACME Tunnel — Temporal Surveillance Gallery

> *"The wall remains undefeated across all timelines."*

Footage from Camera ACM1, the "Tunnel Watcher" in the Leela Manufacturing lobby window. Four views across 700+ years: a tourist learning the lesson, a Cybertruck learning it harder, a medieval knight charging a painted gate, and a Blade Runner replicant fleeing into a holographic lie.

## 📖 The Story

ACME products only work for ACME insiders. The tunnel painted on the boarded-up storefront is a masterpiece of trompe-l'œil art — so convincing that tourists try to walk through it, Teslas try to drive through it, and the wall wins every single time.

Camera ACM1 has seen it all:

**Present Day:** A tourist approaches with hope in their eyes. Moments later: wall. A Cybertruck (Incident #28) lies crumpled against the brick, FSD defeated by cartoon physics.

**Medieval (~1305 AD):** Using the telescope's time travel lens, we see a knight on horseback charging a painted castle gate. Monty Python aesthetics. Same lesson.

**Future (2089 AD):** Los Angeles, perpetual rain, neon everywhere. A replicant flees into what appears to be a glowing holographic tunnel. The hologram is beautiful. The wall behind it is still solid.

The technology changes. The wall does not.

## 🎯 The Lesson

Camera ACM1 knows:
1. **ACME trucks pass through.** Always. Without incident.
2. **Everyone else bounces.** Tourists, pedestrians, cyclists.
3. **Teslas CRASH.** Every time. FSD can't detect painted tunnels.
4. **The lesson never changes.** Insider solutions fail outsiders.

The wall doesn't care what year it is. The wall is eternal.
