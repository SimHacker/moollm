  INCIDENT CAPTURE: CYBERTRUCK COLLISION WITH PAINTED TUNNEL
  Location: ACME Surplus Building, 4 Lane Neverending
  Time: Night, street lights illuminating the scene

  PHOTOREALISTIC SURVEILLANCE PHOTO.

  THE SCENE:
  A Tesla CYBERTRUCK has just CRASHED into the painted tunnel on the boarded-up 
  storefront of the abandoned ACME Surplus building. The vehicle is crumpled 
  against the FLAT WALL where the trompe l'oeil tunnel is painted.

  THE CYBERTRUCK:
  - Distinctive angular stainless steel body
  - Front end CRUMPLED against the wall
  - The geometric panels bent and deformed
  - Smoke and small flames emerging from the front
  - Headlights still on, illuminating the painted tunnel
  - The angular hood crushed in accordion pattern
  - Shattered windshield
  - Driver door open, driver stumbling away in shock
  - The distinctive triangular profile now mangled

  THE PAINTED TUNNEL:
  - Still perfectly visible on the boarded-up window
  - Railroad tracks painted leading into fake darkness
  - Arched stone entrance (painted, not real)
  - The Cybertruck believed it was a real tunnel
  - FSD FAILURE — the AI drove straight into painted wall

  THE DRIVER:
  - Stumbling away from the vehicle
  - Hands on head in disbelief
  - Looking back at the painted tunnel
  - Realizing they drove into a PAINTING
  - Cartoon stars circling their head

  SECURITY CAMERA HUD:
  - 'ACM1' in top left corner
  - 'REC' indicator flashing red
  - Timestamp: 2026-01-19 22:47:12
  - 'LEELA MANUFACTURING' watermark
  - 'INCIDENT DETECTED' alert overlay
  - 'FSD does not understand trompe l'oeil — CAMERA ACM1 analytics'

  PHOTOREALISTIC STYLE with security camera aesthetic.
  Night scene, fire glow, emergency lights approaching.

  MOOD: Darkly comic disaster. The most expensive lesson about painted tunnels.
