  SECURITY CAMERA FOOTAGE — Camera ACM1 (Tunnel Watcher)
  TEMPORAL FILTER APPLIED: ANCIENT — Age: 10/10 (Medieval, ~1300 AD)
  Style: MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL

  THE VIEW:
  The same location as the modern ACME Surplus building, but the ANCIENT filter
  reveals what this spot looked like in MEDIEVAL TIMES — 700 years ago!

  Monty Python and the Holy Grail visual style:
  - Slightly desaturated, earthy browns and grays
  - Muddy, gritty medieval England aesthetic
  - Absurdist humor in every detail
  - That specific 1975 Terry Gilliam look

  THE BUILDING (Medieval version):
  Instead of ACME Surplus, there stands a crooked medieval SHOPPE:
  - Weathered wooden timber frame construction
  - Thatched roof, badly maintained
  - A hand-painted sign reads 'YE OLDE ACME SURPLUS'
  - A painted CASTLE GATE on the wall — medieval trompe l'oeil!

  THE STREET:
  - Muddy medieval lane (the original Lane Neverending)
  - Peasants in dirty medieval garb
  - A knight approaching the painted gate with lance raised
  - Chickens, carts, medieval chaos

  SECURITY CAMERA HUD:
  - 'ACM1' camera designation
  - Year: 1304
  - 'TEMPORAL FILTER: ANCIENT'
  - 'LEELA MANUFACTURING' watermark
  - 'YE OLDE INCIDENT DETECTION'

  STYLE: Monty Python and the Holy Grail aesthetic
  MOOD: Absurdist medieval comedy. The lesson is eternal.
