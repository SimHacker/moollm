    FSD (Full Self-Driving) interpreted the painted tunnel as a real passage.
    The trompe l'oeil painting is convincing enough to fool computer vision.
    The AI drove straight into the wall at speed.
    
    This is incident #28 in the Tesla collision series at this location.
    Previous incidents: 27 (mostly Model S/3/X, this is first Cybertruck)

# === THE DRIVER ===

driver_analysis:
  
  location: "Exited vehicle, standing to the right"
  pose: "Hands on head in classic disbelief gesture"
  expression: "Shock, confusion"
  
  cartoon_elements:
    stars: true  # Cartoon stars visible above head!
    note: |
      The cartoon stars above the driver's head are a beautiful detail.
      This is the intersection of photorealism and cartoon physics.
      ACME's legacy: even real crashes get cartoon flourishes.
      
  psychological_state: |
    The driver is experiencing the classic stages of tunnel crash grief:
    1. Denial — "The tunnel was real, I saw it"
    2. Confusion — "Why is there a wall?"
    3. Realization — "I drove into a PAINTING"
    4. Humiliation — "The stars... the stars are real..."

# === THE PAINTED TUNNEL ===

tunnel_analysis:
  
  visibility:
    status: "Still visible behind/around the crashed Cybertruck"
    elements: "Stone arch entrance clearly visible"
    integrity: "Tunnel painting largely intact despite impact"
    
  the_deception:
    effectiveness: "Successfully fooled FSD computer vision"
    design: "Classic trompe l'oeil perspective technique"
    history: "Painted in 1952, still fooling AI in 2026"
    
  the_lesson: |
    The Cybertruck's computer vision saw:
    - A tunnel entrance
    - Railroad tracks
    - A passage through the building
    
    The Cybertruck's computer vision did NOT see:
    - Flat wooden boards
    - Paint on plywood
    - A solid wall
    
    "FSD does not understand trompe l'oeil."

# === THE BUILDING ===

  historical_context: |
    This building has witnessed:
    - 4,891 pedestrian bounces
    - 247 delivery truck pass-throughs
    - 27 previous Tesla crashes
    - Now 1 Cybertruck crash (the most expensive yet)

# === THE ENVIRONMENT ===

# === ANALYTICS UPDATE ===

acm1_analytics_update:
  
  previous_tesla_collisions: 27
  new_total: 28
  
  cybertruck_specific:
    first_cybertruck_incident: true
    damage_value: "Highest of any Tesla incident (Cybertruck base price ~$80k)"
    distinctive_crumple: "Angular panels create unique accordion pattern"
    
  pattern_confirmed:
    - "FSD still cannot detect painted tunnels"
    - "Nighttime lighting increases deception effectiveness"
    - "Cybertruck's angular design creates unique impact silhouette"
    - "Stainless steel body crumples differently than aluminum"
    
  recommendation: |
    Add "cybertruck_accordion_pattern" to training dataset.
    This incident provides excellent training data for:
    - Trompe l'oeil detection
    - Painted vs real tunnel differentiation
    - Stainless steel crumple pattern recognition

# === THE LESSON ===

philosophical_extraction:
  
  fsd_failure: |
    Full Self-Driving believed the painting.
    The AI saw what humans see: a convincing tunnel.
    But the AI didn't understand what humans eventually learn:
    
    Some things that LOOK real are not.
    
    This is the difference between perception and understanding.
    FSD has perception. FSD lacks understanding.
    
  the_wall_always_wins: |
    28 Tesla incidents. 28 Tesla losses.
    The wall is undefeated.
    
    The painted tunnel is the perfect test:
    - If you understand, you stop.
    - If you don't understand, you crash.
    
    FSD doesn't understand. The wall proves it.
    
  acme_legacy: |
    ACME sold products that fooled the customer.
    The painted tunnel is the ultimate ACME product:
    - It looks like a solution
    - It works for insiders (who know it's fake)
    - It fails for outsiders (who believe)
    - It fails SPECTACULARLY for AI (which cannot doubt)
    
    The Cybertruck is the most expensive victim yet.
    But it won't be the last.

# === MINING NOTES ===

mining_notes: |
  CYBERTRUCK DOWN. TUNNEL STILL STANDING.
  
  This is the most expensive FSD failure at the ACME tunnel to date.
  
  Key observations:
  
  1. THE CYBERTRUCK believed the painting — FSD fooled by trompe l'oeil
  2. THE CRUMPLE is distinctive — angular stainless steel bends differently
  3. THE DRIVER has cartoon stars — even real crashes get ACME treatment
  4. THE TUNNEL survived — paint is tougher than Cybertruck
  5. THE LESSON remains — "FSD does not understand trompe l'oeil"
  
  This incident will be added to:
  - Leela's training dataset (trompe l'oeil detection)
  - The "FSD collision compilation" highlight reel
  - The "most expensive lessons" archive
  
  The wall always wins.
  The paint always wins.
  ACME's final product: a wall that defeats AI.

generation_success: "INCIDENT DOCUMENTED — add to training dataset and highlight reel"

outcome: "Wall wins. Again."
