  description: |
    The LOBBY of Leela Manufacturing is clean, professional, and
    quietly impressive. The Leela logo glows softly on the wall
    behind the reception desk. A directory board lists all floors.
    
    Visitors arrive seeking knowledge. They leave with insights.
    (Or sometimes, more questions than they started with.)

    LEELA MANUFACTURING — LOBBY
    
    RECEPTION DESK:
    A curved desk of polished wood and brushed steel.
    The receptionist smiles warmly. "How can we help you today?"
    Behind them: the Leela logo, glowing gentle gold.

    ELEVATOR:
    Brass doors with art deco styling. The indicator
    shows the current floor. A soft chime when it arrives.
    
    WAITING AREA:
    Comfortable chairs. A coffee table with magazines
    (all about manufacturing, knowledge, and tortoises).
    A small fountain burbles peacefully.
    
    CATALOG KIOSK:
    A polished wooden dispenser with free catalogs.
    Take one, browse here, order at reception.
    Much nicer than waiting outside at ACME's rusted dispenser.
    
    WINDOWS:
    Large windows look out onto Lane Neverending.
    The pub is visible to the east. Lamp posts glow.
