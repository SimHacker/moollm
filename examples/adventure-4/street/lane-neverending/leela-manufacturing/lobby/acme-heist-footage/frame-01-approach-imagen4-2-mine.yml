# Frame 01 Take 2 Mining — THE CLEAR SHOT
# After the interference cleared, the camera saw THIS.
#
# NARRATIVE: Take 1 (glitch) happened at 23:07:42
#            Take 2 (clear) happened at 23:07:43 — ONE SECOND LATER
# The footage tells a story: interference → clarity → doom

mining:
  take: 2
  relationship_to_take_1: "The camera stabilized. Now we see them."

# LAYER 1: SURVEILLANCE LENS — What the camera captured
layer_surveillance:
  composition:
    angle: "Street level, wide shot, slight surveillance feel"
    framing: "Building dominates right half, figures in left-center"
    lighting: "Single sodium streetlamp, amber pools and deep shadows"
    time_of_day: "Night — late, empty streets"
    
  the_building:
    signage:
      main: '"ACME SURPLUS" — large, faded, institutional'
      banner: '"EVERYTHING MUST GO" — hanging, weathered'
      door: '"CLOSED" — small placard visible'
    facade:
      material: "Tan/yellow brick, industrial"
      condition: "Aged, abandoned aesthetic"
      windows: "Dark, dusty, reflecting streetlight"
    THE_PAINTED_TUNNEL:
      location: "Right side of building facade"
      appearance: "INCREDIBLE depth perspective — looks infinite"
      effect: "Trompe l'oeil that catches sodium light oddly"
      note: "This is where ACME physics leak into reality"
      
  the_street:
    name: '"Lane Neverending" — VISIBLE ON STREET SIGN!'
    condition: "Empty, late night, no traffic"
    surface: "Asphalt reflecting amber streetlight"
    other_buildings: "Visible left side — other storefronts in shadow"
    
  the_figures:
    figure_1_don:
      position: "Left of center, crossing street"
      clothing: "PATTERNED SHIRT — dark with light patterns (Hawaiian!)"
      posture: "Walking, slightly behind, following"

    figure_2_instigator:
      position: "Slightly ahead of Don, leading"
      clothing: "Dark jacket, dark pants"
      gesture: "RIGHT ARM EXTENDED toward building — presenting"
      posture: "Confident, directing attention"
      identification: "Face obscured by angle"
      body_language: "This is my idea. Follow me."
      
  details_emerged:
    - "Street sign says 'Lane Neverending' — perfect!"
    - "Another street sign partially visible (cross street?)"
    - "Chain-link fence visible right side of ACME"
    - "Other buildings visible on left — we're on a real street"
    - "The painted tunnel has HEXAGONAL depth patterns"
    - "Single streetlamp creates dramatic silhouette shadows"
    - "Road markings visible — double yellow line"
    
# LAYER 2: DONNA POV — What she sees from control room
layer_donna_pov:
  her_monitor: "ACM1 feed — clear after the interference"
  
  identification_process: |
    "The camera's back. Let me see who we've got...
     
     TWO of them. Very ambitious.
     
     The one in front is pointing at MY building like it's a GIFT.
     Bold. STUPID, but bold.
     
     The one in the shirt... that shirt... I've seen that energy before.
     Bright patterns. No fear. The walk of someone who thinks
     the world is INTERESTING rather than DANGEROUS.
     
     Oh this is going to be TREMENDOUS.
     
     They're almost at the sidewalk. Let me get ready.
     
     *reaches for red lever row*
     
     Welcome to ACME, gentlemen. Everything MUST go.
     Including YOU."
     
  nickname_assignment:
    don: "Pending — 'Hawaiian Hoppy'? 'Patterned Paul'? Need to see his face."
    instigator: "Pending — 'Pointing Pete'? 'Gesture Gary'? He seems like the ringleader."
    
# LAYER 3: THE PAINTED TUNNEL — The Emergent Star
layer_tunnel:
  appearance: |
    The painted tunnel on the facade is SPECTACULAR in this frame.
    
    Hexagonal/octagonal perspective lines creating impossible depth.
    Looks like it extends INFINITELY into the building.
    The sodium light catches it in a way that makes it almost... glow.
    
  significance: |
    This is not just a painted fake tunnel.
    This is where ACME physics leak into normal space.
    
    ACME delivery trucks drive through it (they can).
    Normal people bounce off it (they do).
    Cameras pointed at it glitch (frame 01 take 1 proves this).
    
    It's a WARNING and a TRAP and a DOOR all at once.
    The figures are walking TOWARD it.
    
  foreshadowing: |
    By the end of this heist, someone will TRY to run through that tunnel.
    They will bounce.
    The tunnel will win.
    It always wins.
    
# LAYER 4: NARRATIVE MOMENT
layer_narrative:
  just_before: |
    The camera glitched (take 1). 0.3 seconds of interference.
    During those 0.3 seconds, the figures crossed half the street.
    We missed their first steps. The approach began in static.
    
  right_now: |
    They're on the street. Don in his shirt, following the pointer.
    The building waits. The tunnel glows. The streetlight watches.
    Donna watches. We watch. Everyone watching except them.
    
  just_after: |
    They will reach the sidewalk. They will approach the door.
    The "CLOSED" sign will be ignored. The building will open.
    The anvils will be ready.
    
  always: |
    Two figures. One building. One bad idea.
    The footage will be evidence, but of what?
    
# LAYER 5: COMEDY TIMING
layer_comedy:
  assessment: "PERFECT SETUP"
  
  why_its_funny:
    - "Don's in his HAWAIIAN SHIRT to a heist"
    - "The other guy is POINTING at a clearly closed building"
    - "'EVERYTHING MUST GO' is about to include THEM"
    - "The tunnel looks SO inviting and is SO fake"
    - "Donna is watching and they have NO IDEA"
    
  donna_comment: |
    "Look at Fancy Shirt over there, following Mr. Pointer.
     
     A PATTERNED SHIRT? To break into MY building? At NIGHT?
     
     That's either the confidence of a professional
     or the fashion sense of someone who doesn't know what's coming.
     
     Based on how they're approaching the FRONT DOOR...
     
     I'm going with FASHION VICTIM. About to become ACME VICTIM.
     
     *kisses fingertips* TREMENDOUS."

# COMBINED NARRATIVE — Both Takes Together
combined_narrative:
  sequence:
    - "23:07:42.0 — Take 1: Camera interference begins"
    - "23:07:42.3 — Interference clears"
    - "23:07:43.0 — Take 2: Clear shot, figures mid-crossing"
    
  story: |
    The Leela Cam detected motion at 23:07:42.
    
    As it tried to focus on the approaching figures, 
    ACME's proximity field kicked in. The camera showed its own guts —
    CSS for scanlines, base64 for patterns, the fragile code of surveillance.
    Red and green artifacts bled from the tunnel's direction.
    
    0.3 seconds later, the interference cleared.
    
    And there they were:
    - One figure pointing at ACME SURPLUS like it was Christmas morning
    - One figure in a bright patterned shirt, following with trust
    - The building waiting, painted tunnel glowing, door marked CLOSED
    - The sodium streetlight casting long shadows
    - Lane Neverending living up to its name
    
    In the basement, Donna Toadstool leaned forward.
    "Welcome to the show."

# CONTEXT FOR FRAME 02
context_for_frame_02:
  established:
    - Camera glitched at first (take 1) then stabilized (take 2)
    - Two figures: Don (patterned shirt) and instigator (pointing)
    - Building clearly visible: ACME SURPLUS, EVERYTHING MUST GO, CLOSED
    - Painted tunnel prominent on facade
    - Lane Neverending confirmed
    - Night, sodium light, empty street
    - Donna watching and READY
    
  what_happens_next: |
    They reach the building. The instigator explains the plan (or doesn't).
    Don looks at the painted tunnel, the CLOSED sign, the dark windows.
    
    Does he hesitate? Does he notice the tunnel's glow?
    Does the instigator give any warning at all?
    
    We're about to find out.
    
  emergent_questions:
    - "Will they try the front door first?"
    - "Does Don ask questions or just follow?"
    - "Does the instigator know what they're getting into?"
    - "Will the tunnel draw their attention?"
    - "What has Donna already activated?"
