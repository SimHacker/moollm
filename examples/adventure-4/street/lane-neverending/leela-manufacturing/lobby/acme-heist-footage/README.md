# 🎬 The ACME Heist — Leela Cam Footage

> *"Every painted tunnel is a loaded gun."* — Chekhov, probably

Ten frames of surveillance footage documenting the break-in at ACME Surplus. What started as a simple heist became a cascade of cartoon physics, tunnel multiplication, building fire, and one very confused game designer.
