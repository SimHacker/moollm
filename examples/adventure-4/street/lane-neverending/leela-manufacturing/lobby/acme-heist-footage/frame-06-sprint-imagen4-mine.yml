# Frame 06 Mining — THE LAUNCH

# EMERGENT ELEMENT: "03:17:22" TIMESTAMP in corner!
# True surveillance footage aesthetic achieved!

# DOUBLE ACTION: TWO figures — one flying, one ducking!
# This is the CHAOS FRAME.

  critical_emergence: |
    SECURITY TIMESTAMP appeared in upper right!
    The image knows it's surveillance footage.
    "03:17:22" — frozen moment of chaos.

# LAYER 1: THE HUMAN ROCKET

layer_rocket:
  subject: "The instigator (Gesture Gary)"
  trajectory: "HORIZONTAL — blasting left to right"
  
  propulsion:
    source: "ROCKET SKATES — Aisle 12 special"
    flame: "MASSIVE — bright orange, consuming right side of frame"
    effect: "Full cartoon rocket trail"
    
  pose: |
    AIRBORNE. Arms... somewhere.
    No control. Pure trajectory.
    He's not steering. He's BEING STEERED.
    By physics. ACME physics.
    
  destination: "UNKNOWN — off frame right, into the night"
  
  window_damage:
    right_window: "EXPLODING — sparks, glass, debris"
    left_window: "Spider-crack pattern — previous impact?"
    
  interpretation: |
    This is the moment ACME is famous for.
    
    The moment where a product WORKS.
    Exactly as designed.
    Just not as the user intended.
    
    Rocket skates: FUNCTIONING.
    User control: NONE.
    Destination: WHEREVER MOMENTUM DECIDES.

# LAYER 2: DON'S REACTION

layer_don:
  position: "Center frame, at the entrance/exit"
  pose: "HANDS ON HEAD — universal 'oh god' posture"
  
  jacket: "Colorful — the tie-dye protagonist"
  
  interpretation: |
    Don just watched his friend become a PROJECTILE.
    
    Hands on head. Eyes probably wide.
    The "this is really happening" moment.
    
    He came here for adventure.
    He's getting ADVENTURE.
    More than he wanted.
    Much more.
    
  next_decision: |
    Does he:
    - Chase after his friend (into the night, following flames)
    - Stay inside (where the traps are)
    - Try to help (how?)
    
    The answer is probably: FREEZE.

# LAYER 3: THE TUNNELS

layer_tunnels:
  status: "ORANGE AND BLACK — still evolved"
  position: "Both sides of building, framing EVERYTHING"
  
  behavior: |
    They're WATCHING.
    
    Patient. Symmetrical. Waiting.
    
    The rocket skates were triggered by the CONVEYOR.
    The conveyor was triggered by DONNA.
    But the TUNNELS...
    
    The tunnels haven't been used YET.
    Chekhov's Tunnels are still LOADED.
    
    Someone still has to bounce off one.
    Or try to escape through one.
    Or discover they're REAL.
    
  promise: "The tunnel payoff is COMING."

# LAYER 4: THE TIMESTAMP

layer_timestamp:
  emergent_text: "03:17:22"
  position: "Upper right corner"
  
  significance: |
    The image KNOWS it's surveillance footage.
    
    This timestamp emerged without being prompted.
    The visual aesthetic was so strong, the image
    added its own metadata.
    
    "03:17:22" — frozen in time.
    Evidence. Documentation. The moment captured.
    
    Lawyers will review this timestamp.
    Insurance adjusters will cite this timestamp.
    Donna will frame this timestamp.

# LAYER 5: DONNA'S POV

layer_donna:
  reaction: |
    "YEEEEEEEES!!!
     
     PROPULSION! SUCCESSFUL!
     
     Look at him GO! Look at that TRAJECTORY!
     Is that ESCAPE VELOCITY? It might be!
     
     And FANCY PANTS — hands on head!
     The 'what have I done' pose!
     The 'my friend is now a missile' face!
     
     THIS is why I took this job!
     THIS is what the levers are FOR!
     
     *chef's kiss*
     *pulls out phone*
     *takes selfie*"

# CONTEXT FOR NEXT

context_for_selfie_06:
  donna_state: "TRIUMPHANT — peak chaos achieved"
  event: "Rocket launch success, watching Don's reaction"
  
context_for_frame_07:
  prediction: |
    THE EXTRACTION begins.
    
    Either:
    - Don attempts to leave (hits tunnel?)
    - Don tries to help (more traps?)
    - Instigator lands somewhere (smoking?)
    
    The tunnels are WAITING.
