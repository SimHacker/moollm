    what_we_see: |
      The Leela Cam captures through ACME's windows:
      
      - CONVEYOR BELT has activated — boxes moving
      - One figure (instigator?) ON the conveyor, being carried
      - Don visible further back, arms raised in alarm
      - Industrial lighting flickering
      - Products falling from shelves
      - The tunnel paintings GLOWING (impossible but visible)

      Donna pulled the BLUE lever.
      
      "CONVEYANCE initiated. Gesture Gary is now on the MANDATORY TOUR.
       Let's see how he likes Aisle 7. That's where we keep the SPRINGS."

  visual_elements:
    exterior: "ACME facade, tunnels on both sides glowing slightly"
    windows: "Main action visible through large front windows"
    interior_glimpse: "Conveyor belt running, figure being carried, chaos"
    lighting: "Industrial amber inside, flickering, dramatic"

    The heist has become a RIDE.
    
    Nobody asked to be on this ride.
    The ride doesn't care.
    
    Donna is the ride operator.
    And she just pressed START.
