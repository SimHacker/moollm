# Frame 10 Mining — RICHARD'S CATASTROPHE: THE TUNNEL CONSUMES
#
# EMERGENCE: THE IMAGE LABELED THE CHARACTERS!!!
# "RICHARD" and "DON" appear as text labels!
# The surveillance system KNOWS WHO THEY ARE.
#
# CRITICAL: The tunnel is not passive — it's PULLING RICHARD IN!
# This isn't a THWACK. This is an ABDUCTION.
#
# DON IS NOW A FULL RABBIT. Complete transformation.

  critical_emergence: |
    THE TUNNEL IS ACTIVE.
    
    We expected Richard to HIT the tunnel (THWACK).
    Instead, the tunnel is PULLING HIM IN.
    
    The concentric circles aren't just paint.
    They're a PORTAL. A VORTEX. A CONSUMPTION MECHANISM.
    
    Richard didn't walk into a wall.
    Richard is being TAKEN BY the wall.
    
    This is worse than THWACK. This is ABDUCTION.

# LAYER 1: RICHARD'S FATE

layer_richard:
  status: "BEING CONSUMED BY TUNNEL"
  
  pose:
    body: "Leaning INTO the vortex, off-balance"
    arms: "SPLAYED — trying to resist the pull"
    legs: "One lifted, being drawn forward"
    face: "Shock, disbelief, academic horror"
    
  glasses:
    status: "FLYING — swirling above his head"
    motion_lines: "Cartoon spiral indicating rotation"
    to: "Unknown — possibly inside the tunnel"
    
  bag:
    status: "Swinging from momentum"
    contents: "Probably notes on player taxonomy"
    irony: "Those notes won't help here"
    
  interpretation: |
    The game designer who wrote about virtual spaces
    is being pulled INTO a painted space.
    
    The man who theorized about perception and reality
    is experiencing a reality that doesn't care about theory.
    
    THE TAXONOMY BEING APPLIED:
    Richard is an EXPLORER who found something
    that EXPLORES BACK.
    
    This is the deepest irony:
    He gave permission to be simulated.
    The simulation is now TAKING him.

# LAYER 2: DON'S FULL TRANSFORMATION

layer_don_rabbit:
  status: "COMPLETE RABBIT — Bunny Backfire FINALIZED"
  
  appearance:
    body: "FULL RABBIT — not human with rabbit features"
    ears: "Long, grey, rabbit ears"
    face: "Rabbit face — no longer human"
    fur: "Grey/brown rabbit coloring"
    clothing: "TIE-DYE HOODIE — still wearing it!"
    posture: "Bipedal but RABBIT"
    
  action: "REACHING toward Richard — trying to HELP"
  
  interpretation: |
    The Bunny Backfire is COMPLETE.
    
    Don is no longer "becoming" a rabbit.
    Don IS a rabbit.
    A tie-dye wearing rabbit who remembers being human.
    Who is trying to save his friend from a vortex.
    
    The spell that bounced back in Richard's study
    has fully manifested under ACME physics stress.
    
    Don's consciousness appears intact (he's helping).
    But his form is pure lagomorph.
    
  continuity_note: |
    This connects DIRECTLY to the earlier session:
    - Selfie 07 in Richard's study
    - Don attempted bunny ears prank
    - Spell reflected (Richard's saving throw)
    - Don became rabbit in photo
    - "Bunny Backfire" named
    - Dragon was responsible
    
    Now: FULL PHYSICAL TRANSFORMATION.
    
    The narrative has TEETH.
    Actions have CONSEQUENCES.
    Even joke actions.

# LAYER 3: THE TUNNEL EVOLUTION

layer_tunnel_finale:
  previous: "Concentric circles (passive)"
  current: "ACTIVE VORTEX (consuming)"
  
  behavior: |
    The blue tunnel is no longer decoration.
    It's a MECHANISM.
    
    It's PULLING Richard into it.
    The concentric circles suggest depth.
    The glow suggests energy.
    The effect suggests HUNGER.
    
    Chekhov's Tunnel wasn't just loaded.
    Chekhov's Tunnel was ALIVE.
    
  to: |
    Where does the tunnel GO?
    
    - Another dimension?
    - Inside ACME?
    - Into the fire?
    - Into the game Richard designed?
    - Nowhere? Forever falling?
    
    We may never know.
    Richard might find out.

# LAYER 4: THE CHARACTER LABELS

layer_labels:
  emergence: "The image LABELED the characters"
  
  richard_label: '"RICHARD" — positioned near him'
  don_label: '"DON" — positioned near rabbit-Don'
  
  interpretation: |
    The surveillance system KNOWS WHO THEY ARE.
    
    This isn't random footage.
    This is IDENTIFIED footage.
    
    The Leela Cam has:
    - Facial recognition (even for rabbits?)
    - Character databases
    - The ability to LABEL subjects
    
    This footage is EVIDENCE.
    Labeled evidence.
    Of a distinguished academic being consumed by a tunnel
    while a rabbit in tie-dye tries to help.

# LAYER 5: THE FIRE

layer_fire:
  status: "MAXIMUM — building fully engulfed"
  visibility: "Flames visible through/around building"
  role: "Background chaos, driver of urgency"
  
  interpretation: |
    The fire doesn't care about the tunnel.
    The tunnel doesn't care about the fire.
    
    Two different physics systems
    operating simultaneously:
    - Fire physics (burn, spread, consume)
    - Tunnel physics (paint, depth, ABDUCTION)
    
    Richard is between them.
    Don is trying to help.
    ACME is providing the venue.

# NARRATIVE STATUS

narrative_status:
  richard: "Being consumed by tunnel — fate unknown"
  don: "Full rabbit — trying to help — can only squeak"
  instigator: "Presumably watching in horror"
  donna: "Probably still taking selfies"
  tunnels: "One active (consuming), one waiting"
  building: "On fire (still)"
  
  irony_achieved: |
    Richard Bartle, who:
    - Defined how players interact with virtual worlds
    - Wrote the taxonomy of player types
    - Designed the physics of MUD1
    - Gave permission to be simulated
    
    Is now:
    - Being TAKEN by a simulated space
    - Being CATEGORIZED by cartoon physics
    - Experiencing physics he didn't write
    - A subject in someone else's story
    
    THE IRONY IS COMPLETE.
    
    The game designer became the game.
