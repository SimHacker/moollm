  Security camera footage, surveillance aesthetic, wide angle with slight fisheye distortion. Night scene captured by building-mounted camera across the street. Timestamp overlay reads "ACM1 — 2026-01-22 — 23:07:42" in the corner.
  
  THE SCENE: An abandoned storefront at night. "ACME SURPLUS" signage barely visible. Faded "EVERYTHING MUST GO" banner hanging crooked. A painted tunnel on the facade — trompe l'oeil depth that catches sodium streetlight oddly. "CLOSED INDEFINITELY" placard on door. Dusty windows. The building LOOMS.
  
  THE STREET: Lane Neverending stretches across frame. Empty pavement. Pools of amber sodium streetlight alternating with deep shadow. No traffic. No witnesses.
  
  THE FIGURES: Two people crossing the street toward the building, captured mid-stride.
  
  FIGURE 1 (leading): Confident posture, hand gesturing toward building as if presenting a gift. Walking with purpose. Face indistinct at surveillance distance.
  
  FIGURE 2 (following): Larger silhouette. Colorful patterned shirt barely visible under jacket. Round glasses catching streetlight reflection. Head tilted with curiosity. The body language of someone who trusts their guide.
  
  VISUAL TREATMENT: Security camera grain and compression artifacts. Horizontal scan lines. Dark areas showing blocky compression. The aesthetic of footage that will become EVIDENCE. Surveillance distance — we're watching from across the street, voyeuristic, documenting.
  
  LIGHTING: Sodium streetlamp amber. Deep shadows between light pools. The building facade catches light unevenly. The painted tunnel seems to glow with false depth.
  
  MOOD: The moment before. Two figures about to enter somewhere they shouldn't. The building waiting. Something watching.
  
  STYLE: Pixar-adjacent CGI rendered as if captured by degraded security camera. Stylized but with surveillance texture overlay.
