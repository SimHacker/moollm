    what_we_see: |
      ACROSS THE STREET:
      
      Two figures on the Leela Manufacturing side.
      Both visibly disheveled. Both SMOKING slightly.
      Don: Holding his head, tie-dye jacket torn/sooty.
      Instigator: Leaning, possibly missing a shoe.
      
      They made it out. Somehow.
      They're looking back at ACME.
      
      THE BUILDING:
      - Windows shattered (both sides)
      - Painted tunnels intact — waiting for next time
      - ACME SURPLUS sign still lit, smug
      - Interior visible through broken windows
      
      THE MOOD:
      "We escaped."
      "We'll never speak of this again."
      "Donna is watching."

      Donna, from her throne:
      
      "Come back ANY TIME, boys.
       I'll be here.
       The tunnels will be here.
       
       ...
       
       Actually, come back soon.
       I'm almost out of nicknames."

  visual_elements:
    exterior: "ACME facade, damaged but standing"
    tunnels: "Both intact — orange/black and blue/black"
    survivors: "Two figures across the street, looking back"
    damage: "Broken windows, scattered glass"
    lighting: "Night, aftermath calm"
    
  narrative_beat: |
    The heist is OVER.
    
    Nobody got what they came for.
    Everybody got what ACME delivered.
    
    They'll recover. They'll tell stories.
    They'll never go back.
    
    (They might go back.)
    
    The Mushroom Queen waits.
