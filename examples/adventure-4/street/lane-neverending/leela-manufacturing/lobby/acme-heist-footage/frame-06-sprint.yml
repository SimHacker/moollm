    what_we_see: |
      Through the Leela Cam:
      
      - ONE FIGURE (probably instigator) BLASTING horizontally
      - ROCKET SKATES leaving fire trails
      - SIDE WINDOW SHATTERING — glass flying
      - Arms pinwheeling for control (there is no control)
      - Trajectory: OUT of building, across frame
      - Landing prediction: NOT GOOD
      
      - DON visible through front window, ducking/covering
      - Orange/black tunnels watching, patient

      Donna: "PROPULSION INITIATED!"
      
      "He found the rocket skates! Or they found HIM!
       That's Aisle 12 doing what Aisle 12 DOES!
       
       Did he put them on? NO!
       Did he bump the ignition lever? PROBABLY!
       Does it matter? NOT ANYMORE!
       
       ENJOY YOUR FLIGHT, GESTURE GARY!"

    ACME PROPULSION is not a toy.
    
    Actually it IS a toy.
    An extremely dangerous toy.
    That someone just played with.
    
    Against their will.
