    - "Building on fire (Frame 08)"
    - "Don and instigator across the street, traumatized"
    - "Spiral tunnels still glowing"
    - "Donna: double peace signs, maximum mushrooms"
    - "Richard's study is nearby — he heard the explosion"
    - "Don was previously Bunny Backfired (see: Richard's study selfies)"

      expression: "Academic curiosity meets 'what fresh hell is this'"
      approach: "Walking toward the burning building with scholarly interest"
      thought: "'Fascinating. The building appears to be on fire. I should document this for—'"

      trigger: "Stress from heist + seeing Richard + accumulated Bunny Backfire"
      behavior: |
        Don's ears twitch (he doesn't have rabbit ears, but they TWITCH).
        His nose starts doing the rabbit wiggle.
        He crouches lower. Twitchier.
        The tie-dye jacket looks more like FUR somehow.
        
        The Bunny Backfire is COMPLETING.
        What started as a prank in Richard's study has become TRANSFORMATION.

      Richard Bartle:
      - Designed MUD1 (multi-user dungeon)
      - Created player type taxonomy (Achievers, Explorers, Socializers, Killers)
      - Literally WROTE THE BOOK on virtual worlds
      
      About to experience:
      - ACME physics (not his physics)
      - Cartoon logic (not his logic)
      - Becoming an NPC in someone else's story
      - The taxonomy being applied TO HIM
      
      What type is Richard right now?
      EXPLORER walking into KILLER territory.
      
  visual_elements:
    exterior: "Burning ACME, spiral tunnels glowing"
    richard: "Distinguished figure approaching from shadows"
    don: "Crouching, twitching, increasingly rabbit-like"
    instigator: "Probably hiding"
    
  narrative_beat: |
    The man who gave us permission to simulate him
    is about to discover what that MEANS.
    
    Cartoon physics don't care about credentials.
    ACME doesn't care about taxonomy.
    
    And somewhere, a dragon is probably responsible.
