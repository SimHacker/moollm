  narrative_beat: |
    They've reached the sidewalk.
    
    The instigator turns to Don, gesturing grandly at the building.
    "Look at this place! ACME Surplus! Abandoned for years!
    Nobody's watching. Nobody cares. We just... go in. See what's there."
    
    Don looks at the building. The faded signs. The painted tunnel.
    The "CLOSED" sign that seems very emphatic.
    
    He looks at the instigator.
    He looks at his patterned shirt.
    He thinks about how this seems like a GREAT adventure.
    
    "...Is there a plan?"
    
    "The plan is we GO IN."
    
    Don looks at the painted tunnel again. It seems to... shimmer.
    
    "What's that tunnel thing?"
    
    "Decoration. Optical illusion. Very vintage."
    
    In the basement, Donna chuckles.
    "Oh honey. You wish it was just decoration."

    CAMERA: ACM1, same angle but they're now ON the sidewalk
    TIME: 33 seconds after Frame 01 Take 2
    
    THE FIGURES — NOW IN FRONT OF BUILDING:
    
    THE INSTIGATOR:
    - Standing near the entrance, turned toward Don
    - One arm extended toward the building in grand gesture
    - Body language: "Look at this treasure! It's OURS!"
    - Face possibly visible now (closer to camera)
    
    DON:
    - Slightly back, looking at the building
    - Head tilted — examining the painted tunnel
    - Patterned shirt clearly visible in building's ambient light
    - Body language: considering, curious, not quite convinced
    - Glasses reflecting the tunnel's strange glow
    
    THE BUILDING:
    - Closer now, more detail visible
    - The "CLOSED" sign very prominent
    - The painted tunnel DOMINATES — that hexagonal depth
    - Dark windows, but is something moving inside?
    - The streetlight catches the "EVERYTHING MUST GO" banner
    
    THE TUNNEL:
    - From this angle, it looks even MORE like a real passage
    - The depth perspective is hypnotic
    - Is it... glowing? Or is that just the streetlight?
    - Don is STARING at it
    
    DETAILS:
    - A rat crossing the sidewalk (ACME wildlife)
    - Shadows from the figures cast long on building facade
    - The chain-link fence continues to the right
    - Maybe a flicker in one of the dark windows?

      dialogue_implied: "Come on, it'll be amazing!"

      position: "On sidewalk, slightly back from instigator"
      posture: "Examining, considering, head tilted"
      focus: "THE PAINTED TUNNEL — can't stop looking at it"
      expression: "Curious but... is that hesitation?"

    commentary: |
      "Look at Fancy Shirt over there. Staring at my tunnel.
       
       Does he SENSE something? Most people don't even notice it.
       But he's STARING. Like he can feel it staring BACK.
       
       Smart instincts. Terrible friends.
       
       Mr. Grand Gesture over there has no IDEA what he's leading
       his buddy into. But Fancy Shirt... he feels it.
       
       This is going to be INTERESTING.
       
       ...
       
       Oh look, he's going to follow anyway. EXCELLENT."
       
    nickname_update:
      don: "Fancy Shirt Freddy? No... Tunnel-Watcher Tim? He SEES things."
      instigator: "Gesture Gary. Final answer. That arm wave was TREMENDOUS."
      
  visual_style: |
    Same surveillance aesthetic, but CLOSER.
    
    The figures are on the sidewalk now — larger in frame.
    The building looms behind them. The tunnel dominates.
    
    LIGHTING:
    - Sodium streetlight still primary
    - But now building's ambient light adds detail
    - The tunnel catches light in an impossible way
    - Don's glasses reflect SOMETHING (the tunnel?)
    
    COMPOSITION:
    - Two figures frame the entrance
    - The tunnel is positioned like a third character
    - The "CLOSED" sign acts as visual warning
    - Shadows on the building tell a story
    
    GRAIN/ARTIFACTS:
    - Still surveillance aesthetic
    - But cleaner than take 1 — camera has stabilized
    - Maybe a slight flicker at the tunnel? (ACME interference)
    
  narrative_moment:
    just_before: "They crossed the street. The camera followed. Donna waited."
    right_now: "The invitation. The choice. The point of no return approaching."
    just_after: "Don will say yes. They will approach the door."
    always: "Every heist has a moment where someone should say 'maybe not.'"
    
  foreshadowing:
    - "Don is staring at the tunnel. The tunnel is staring back."
    - "The 'CLOSED' sign is a warning they're about to ignore."
    - "Something might be moving in those dark windows."
    - "Donna's fingers are on the levers."
    - "The rat knows something. It's leaving."

  what_happens_next: |
    The decision is made. They approach the door.
    
    Will they:
    - Try the front door? (ANVIL TRAP)
    - Go for the side window? (ROCKET SKATES)
    - Notice the "DO NOT ENTER" signs?
    - Actually READ the CLOSED sign?
    
    Frame 03: "The Entry" — they try to get in.
