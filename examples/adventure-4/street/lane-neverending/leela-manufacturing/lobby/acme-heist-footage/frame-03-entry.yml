# Frame 03: The Entry
# "They try the front door. ACME responds."
#
# CHEKHOV'S TUNNEL: Loaded in Frame 02. Will fire later.
# CURRENT OBJECTIVE: Get inside. Trigger the first trap.
#
# PREVIOUS CONTEXT:
# - Frame 01: Camera glitch → clear shot of approach
# - Frame 02: At the door, tunnel DOMINATES, instigator reaching
# - Don's glasses reflect the tunnel — he's been marked
# - The CLOSED sign was ignored. The EVERYTHILG banner warned them.

    The instigator tries the door.
    
    To everyone's surprise (including Donna's), it opens.
    
    "See? I TOLD you nobody watches this place!"
    
    They step inside—
    
    *WHOOOOSH*
    
    From above the door frame, something SWINGS DOWN.
    A shape. Large. Metal. Moving FAST.
    
    The first lesson of ACME Surplus:
    The door isn't locked because the WELCOME is deadlier than the lock.
    
  scene_description: |
    CAMERA: ACM1, same angle, capturing the door area
    TIME: 32 seconds after Frame 02
    
    THE MOMENT: The door has just OPENED. They're stepping through.
    Something is HAPPENING above the doorframe.
    
    OPTION A — THE SETUP:
    Door opening, figures silhouetted against interior darkness,
    SOMETHING VISIBLE above the door (rope? shadow? ANVIL?)
    The moment BEFORE the trap springs.
    
    OPTION B — THE STRIKE:
    Door open, figures inside, ANVIL mid-swing on rope,
    Motion blur, the chaos of the first trap activating.
    Donna's favorite greeting: Model 7B.
    
    EITHER WAY:
    - The tunnel is still visible, watching
    - The CLOSED sign has been ignored
    - Interior darkness yawns beyond them
    - Something is in motion
    
    THE FIGURES:
    
    INSTIGATOR:
    - At or through the door
    - Posture: triumphant or ALARMED
    - Depending on timing: "I told you!" or "WHAT THE—"
    
    DON:
    - Following through door OR reacting to movement above
    - Colorful jacket visible
    - Expression: curious → alarmed (milliseconds apart)
    
    THE TRAP:
    - ANVIL on rope (classic Model 7B)
    - Swinging from above door frame
    - If visible: arc of motion, rope tension
    - If implied: shadows, motion lines, figures' reactions
    
    THE BUILDING:
    - Door OPEN now — dark interior beyond
    - The tunnel still visible to the right
    - "CLOSED" sign now ironic
    - Streetlamp still illuminating the threshold

    commentary: |
      "THE FRONT DOOR. THE. FRONT. DOOR.
       
       Do they not see the SIGNS? The WARNINGS? The EVERYTHING?
       
       *pulls lever*
       
       WELCOME TO ACME, GENTLEMEN!
       
       That's the Model 7B! My FAVORITE! 
       The arc on that thing is BEAUTIFUL!
       
       Dodge LEFT and you hit the shelves!
       Dodge RIGHT and there's the RETURN COUNTER!
       Dodge BACKWARDS and you're back outside!
       
       Take it FULL and you're a CARTOON!
       
       Let's see what Fancy Pants is made of!"

    MOTION AND CHAOS.
    
    This is the first ACTION frame. Things are happening.
    
    ELEMENTS:
    - Motion blur on the anvil or figures
    - Door frame as threshold between safety and danger
    - Interior darkness yawning beyond
    - The tunnel still visible (Chekhov reminder)
    - Shadows telling the story of movement
    
    LIGHTING:
    - Streetlamp still illuminating from behind
    - Interior of ACME is DARK — silhouettes
    - The anvil catching light as it swings
    
    SURVEILLANCE AESTHETIC:
    - Grain, timestamp, compression
    - Maybe some motion blur artifacts
    - The look of "this camera caught something HAPPENING"
    
  narrative_moment:
    just_before: "The door was touched. It opened. Too easy."
    right_now: "ANVIL. IN. MOTION."
    just_after: "Someone is hit, dodged, or flattened. They're inside regardless."
    always: "The easy entrance is never easy."
    
  foreshadowing:
    - "This is just the GREETING — worse awaits inside"
    - "The tunnel watches from outside — its moment will come"
    - "Donna is just getting started"
    - "The 'ticking' from the back room continues"

# CONTEXT FOR FRAME 04
context_for_frame_04:
  trap_status: "First anvil deployed"
  location: "Now INSIDE ACME Surplus"
  lighting: "Interior dark, some streetlight through windows"
  
  what_happens_next: |
    They're IN. Damaged or not, they made it inside.
    
    Now they see:
    - Empty shelves stretching into darkness
    - The return counter with defective products
    - Shadows moving (dust bunnies? something else?)
    - And deeper in... the ticking from the back room
    
    Frame 04: "First Contact" — they see what they've gotten into.
