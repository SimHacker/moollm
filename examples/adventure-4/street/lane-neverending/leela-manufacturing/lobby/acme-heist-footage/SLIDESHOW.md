# 🎬 The ACME Heist

> *"Every painted tunnel is a loaded gun." — Chekhov, probably*

Ten frames of surveillance footage documenting the break-in at ACME Surplus. What started as a simple heist became a cascade of cartoon physics, tunnel multiplication, building fire, and one very confused game designer.

**Camera**: ACM1 (Leela Manufacturing, across the street)  
**Date**: 2026-01-22  
**Parallel Coverage**: [Donna's Selfies](../../../../characters/fictional/donna-toadstool/selfies/SLIDESHOW.md)

## 🔗 The Parallel Timelines

While these events unfold, Donna Toadstool documents them from her control room:

| Heist Frame | Donna's Selfie | What Donna Does |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------|
| 01: Approach | Intruder Alert | "LOOK WHAT I'VE FOUND!" |
| 02: Invitation | Tunnel Watch | Reveals controllable tunnels |
| 03: Entry | Anvil Deployed | "I DID THAT!" |
| 04: Inside | Tunnels Multiply | "I TOLD YOU!" |
| 05: Deeper | Conveyor Chaos | Hand on lever |
| 06: Sprint | Propulsion Success | Chef's kiss |
| 07: Extraction | THWACK Moment | Home Alone face |
| 08: Aftermath | Aftermath Gloat | Double peace signs |
| 09-10: Richard | This is Fine | Sips coffee amid apocalypse |

## 📍 Frame 01: The Approach {#frame-01}

![The Approach](frame-01-approach-imagen4.png)

**Time**: ~02:30 AM  
**↔️ Donna's View**: [Selfie 01 — Intruder Alert](../../../../characters/fictional/donna-toadstool/selfies/SLIDESHOW.md#selfie-01) *"LOOK WHAT I'VE FOUND!"*

**The Moment**: Two figures cross the street toward ACME Surplus. The first frame has interference — ACME's reality-distortion field affecting the camera.

**Emergent**: Glitchy camera feed accepted as canon. The building doesn't want to be filmed clearly.

## 📍 Frame 02: The Invitation {#frame-02}

### *Chekhov's Tunnel Established*

![The Invitation](frame-02-invitation-imagen4.png)

**↔️ Donna's View**: [Selfie 02 — Tunnel Watch](../../../../characters/fictional/donna-toadstool/selfies/SLIDESHOW.md#selfie-02) *"WATCH THIS!"*

**The Gun Appears**: A painted tunnel takes up 40% of the frame. Black and white checkered. Don is MESMERIZED by it.

**Emergent**: "EVERYTHILG" typo on banner — ACME's attention to detail matches its physics.

## 📍 Frame 03: The Entry {#frame-03}

![The Entry](frame-03-entry-imagen4.png)

**↔️ Donna's View**: [Selfie 04 — Tunnels Multiply](../../../../characters/fictional/donna-toadstool/selfies/SLIDESHOW.md#selfie-04) *"I TOLD YOU!"*

**Spatial Anomaly**: The tunnels are now on BOTH SIDES. They've MULTIPLIED. The warehouse is bigger on the inside.

**Don's Jacket**: Now psychedelic colors — he's become a TARGET.

## 📍 Frame 07: THWACK — Chekhov's Tunnel FIRES {#frame-07}

![THWACK](frame-07-extraction-imagen4.png)

**↔️ Donna's View**: [Selfie 07 — THWACK Moment](../../../../characters/fictional/donna-toadstool/selfies/SLIDESHOW.md#selfie-07) — Home Alone face!

**The Gun Goes Off**: Don hits the painted tunnel. It's a WALL. "THWACK!" appears in frame.

**Emergent Text**: The image wrote its own sound effect.

**Escalation**: The building is ON FIRE. Three figures look back. Tunnels have evolved to SPIRALS.

**Emergent Timestamp**: "03:17 AM 10-27-24"

## 📍 Frame 10: Richard's Catastrophe {#frame-10}

### *The Game Designer Consumed by Simulated Physics*

![Richard Catastrophe](frame-10-richard-catastrophe-imagen4.png)

**↔️ Donna's View**: [Selfie 09 — This is Fine](../../../../characters/fictional/donna-toadstool/selfies/SLIDESHOW.md#selfie-09) — "This is fine."  
**→ Then**: [Selfie 10 — The Denouement](../../../../characters/fictional/donna-toadstool/selfies/SLIDESHOW.md#selfie-10) — The private one

**Maximum Irony**: Richard is PULLED INTO the tunnel vortex. The man who invented virtual worlds, consumed by cartoon physics.

**Don's Full Transformation**: Now a COMPLETE RABBIT, trying to help.

**Emergent Labels**: The image labeled the characters — "RICHARD" and "DON" with "REC" indicator.

**→ CONTINUES IN**: [Post-Heist Fellowship](../../../../pub/photos/post-heist-fellowship/SLIDESHOW.md) — Everyone goes to the pub
