  Security camera footage, surveillance aesthetic, night scene. Timestamp overlay "ACM1 — 2026-01-22 — 23:08:15". Slight fisheye, grain, compression artifacts — the look of evidence.
  
  THE SCENE: Two figures now standing ON THE SIDEWALK in front of an abandoned storefront. The building reads "ACME SURPLUS" with a faded "EVERYTHING MUST GO" banner. A "CLOSED" sign on the door. The iconic PAINTED TUNNEL on the facade — impossibly deep hexagonal perspective lines that catch streetlight and seem to GLOW.
  
  FIGURE 1 — THE INSTIGATOR (left): Dark jacket, standing near the entrance, TURNED TOWARD the other figure. One arm extended in a grand presenting gesture toward the building. Body language saying "Look at this! It's ours!" Face partially visible now — eager, confident.
  
  FIGURE 2 — DON (right): Larger build, wearing a COLORFUL PATTERNED SHIRT visible under jacket. Standing slightly back. Head TILTED, STARING at the painted tunnel with intense curiosity. Glasses reflecting the tunnel's strange glow. Body language: examining, hesitant, fascinated by the tunnel.
  
  THE PAINTED TUNNEL: Dominates the right side of the building. Hexagonal/octagonal perspective lines creating impossible depth — looks like it extends forever. Catches the sodium light oddly. Almost seems to GLOW. Don is STARING at it.
  
  THE BUILDING: Looming behind them. Dark windows (is something moving inside?). The "CLOSED" sign prominent. The entrance between the figures.
  
  DETAILS: A rat crossing the sidewalk fleeing the scene. Long shadows cast by streetlight. Chain-link fence continuing right. The sense that the building is WATCHING.
  
  LIGHTING: Sodium streetlamp amber, but now building ambient adds detail. The tunnel glows with false depth. Shadows tell a story.
  
  MOOD: The invitation. The choice before the crime. One gestures grandly, the other hesitates. The tunnel watches. Something waits.
  
  STYLE: Pixar-adjacent CGI with surveillance camera texture overlay. Stylized but documentary feeling.
