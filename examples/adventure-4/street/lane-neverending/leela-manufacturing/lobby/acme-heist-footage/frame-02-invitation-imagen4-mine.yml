# Frame 02 Mining — CHEKHOV'S TUNNEL
#
# "If you show a painted tunnel in act one, someone must bounce off it in act three."
# — Anton Chekhov (probably)
#
# THE EMERGENCE: The tunnel went from background detail to DOMINANT VISUAL ELEMENT.
# It is now a character. A promise. A trap waiting to spring.

    CHEKHOV'S TUNNEL: If a painted tunnel appears prominently in the frame,
    someone MUST attempt to run through it before the story ends.
    
    They will fail. They will bounce. The tunnel will win.
    
    This is now INEVITABLE.

# LAYER 1: SURVEILLANCE — What the camera captured
layer_surveillance:
  composition:
    figures: "Two, now at the building"
    building: "ACME SURPLUS dominates upper frame"
    THE_TUNNEL: "MASSIVE black-and-white spiral — 40% of frame"
    
  the_figures:
    instigator:
      position: "Left, at the door"
      action: "ARM EXTENDED, pointing at or touching door"
      clothing: "Dark jacket, reaching"
      body_language: "About to try the door"
      
    don:
      position: "Right, near tunnel"
      clothing: "COLORFUL PATTERNED JACKET — orange/green visible!"
      glasses: "Visible, reflecting the tunnel"
      body_language: "Looking at the tunnel? Or the door?"
      proximity_to_tunnel: "DANGEROUSLY CLOSE"
      
  the_building:
    signage: "ACME SURPLUS" — large, clear, institutional
    banner: "EVERYTHILG MUST GO" — typo! (ACME quality control)
    door_signs:
      - "CLOSED" — blue sign on door
      - Another "COS..." — partially visible (more warnings)
    window: "Dark storefront window, reflections"
    lamp: "Old-fashioned street lamp providing warm light"
    
  THE_TUNNEL:
    location: "RIGHT SIDE — dominates the facade"
    design: "Black and white concentric hexagons/octagons"
    effect: "HYPNOTIC DEPTH — draws the eye inevitably"
    size: "MASSIVE — roughly 40% of total frame"
    center: "Dark void at center — the 'destination'"
    
    emergence_note: |
      In Frame 01 Take 2, the tunnel was visible but background.
      In Frame 02, it has GROWN. It DOMINATES.
      
      The closer they get, the more powerful it becomes.
      
      This is not perspective. This is the tunnel WANTING to be seen.
      
# LAYER 2: CHEKHOV'S TUNNEL — The Dramatic Promise
layer_chekhov:
  the_principle: |
    Chekhov's Gun: "If in the first act you have hung a pistol on the wall,
    then in the following one it should be fired."
    
    Chekhov's Tunnel: "If in the first frames you have painted a tunnel on
    the wall, then in the climax someone should bounce off it."
    
  the_setup:
    frame_01_take_2: "Tunnel visible, mysterious, glowing"
    frame_02: "Tunnel DOMINATES, hypnotic, drawing Don's eye"
    
  the_promise: |
    Before this heist ends, someone will:
    
    1. Be chased toward the tunnel
    2. See it as an escape route
    3. Run full speed, believing
    4. *THWACK*
    5. Slide down the plywood
    6. Add their silhouette to the collection
    
    Meanwhile, an ACME delivery truck will drive casually through.
    
  predicted_frame: "Frame 07 or 08 — the desperate escape attempt"
  
  don_trajectory: |
    Look at Don in this frame. He's RIGHT NEXT TO IT.
    His glasses are REFLECTING it.
    He's already being DRAWN IN.
    
    When the anvils fall and the rocket skates ignite,
    when everything goes wrong and he needs to ESCAPE —
    his brain will remember the tunnel.
    
    "There was a tunnel! On the building! I SAW it!"
    
    And he will run.
    
    And he will bounce.
    
# LAYER 3: DONNA POV — What she sees
layer_donna:
  reaction: |
    "Oh. OH. Look at Fancy Pants next to my TUNNEL.
     
     He's STARING at it. He's RIGHT THERE.
     
     Does he think it's REAL? Does he think he could just...
     walk through? Run through?
     
     Oh please. PLEASE let him try later.
     
     I've been waiting SO LONG for someone to really TRY.
     
     The delivery drivers go through it every day. 
     Packages fly through constantly.
     But NORMAL PEOPLE?
     
     *THWACK*
     
     Every. Single. Time.
     
     Come on, Fancy Pants. Remember that tunnel.
     Remember it when you're running for your life."
     
  contingency_plan: |
    If things go REALLY well tonight, I'll herd them toward it.
    
    Anvil from the left → they dodge right
    Rocket skates from behind → they accelerate
    The tunnel straight ahead → they AIM
    
    Physics does the rest.
    
# LAYER 4: THE TYPO — "EVERYTHILG MUST GO"
layer_typo:
  observed: "'EVERYTHILG MUST GO' instead of 'EVERYTHING'"
  
  interpretation: |
    ACME quality control at work.
    
    Or maybe not a typo. Maybe "EVERYTHILG" is:
    - An ACME product category we haven't discovered
    - A warning in a language we don't speak
    - A glitch in the camera's text recognition (ACME proximity field)
    - Exactly how ACME spells it
    
  donna_take: |
    "The sign has ALWAYS said that. Don't question the sign."
    
# LAYER 5: EMERGENCE — What we didn't plan
layer_emergence:
  unexpected_elements:
    - "The tunnel is 3x larger than in Frame 01"
    - "The typo in EVERYTHILG"
    - "Don's jacket is MORE colorful than expected (orange/green!)"
    - "The instigator is already TOUCHING the door"
    - "Old-fashioned lamp post (very atmospheric)"
    - "Multiple CLOSED/warning signs on door"
    
  what_this_means: |
    The narrative is ACCELERATING.
    
    The instigator isn't explaining — he's ALREADY AT THE DOOR.
    Don isn't hesitating — he's been CAPTURED by the tunnel.
    The building isn't waiting — it's PULLING them in.
    
    Frame 03 won't be "considering entry."
    Frame 03 will be "entry in progress."
    
  commit: true  # YES AND all of this
  
# LAYER 6: COMEDY TIMING
layer_comedy:
  the_tunnel_gag: |
    Setup (now): Don sees tunnel, is mesmerized
    Development (later): Don is chased, sees "escape route"
    Punchline (climax): *THWACK* → silhouette on plywood
    
    Timing: Perfect Looney Tunes structure
    
  donna_commentary: |
    "That tunnel has a 100% bounce rate for civilians.
     
     ACME EMPLOYEES? Walk right through.
     DELIVERY TRUCKS? No problem.
     WILE E. COYOTE? He learned. Eventually.
     EVERYONE ELSE? 
     
     *THWACK*
     
     It's not that the tunnel is FAKE.
     It's that you're not AUTHORIZED."
     
# NARRATIVE MOMENT
narrative_moment:
  just_before: "They crossed the street. Don noticed the tunnel."
  right_now: "The invitation becomes entry. The door is touched."
  just_after: "Something will trigger. An anvil? A click? A voice?"
  always: "Chekhov loaded the tunnel. Someone must fire it."
  
# CONTEXT FOR FRAME 03
context_for_frame_03:
  chekhov_gun_loaded:
    - "The tunnel is ESTABLISHED — hypnotic, dominant, tempting"
    - "Don has SEEN it — his glasses reflect it"
    - "It MUST pay off — someone bounces before the end"
    
  current_situation:
    - "Instigator at door, hand extended (about to try entry)"
    - "Don beside him, captured by tunnel visually"
    - "Multiple warning signs (CLOSED, COS...)"
    - "Building waiting, traps armed"
    - "Donna watching, levers ready"
    
  frame_03_prediction: |
    THE ENTRY — They get in (or try to).
    
    Options:
    A) Door opens → ANVIL DROPS
    B) Door locked → they try window → ROCKET SKATES
    C) Something else (emergence)
    
    Whatever happens, the tunnel watches.
    The tunnel remembers.
    The tunnel waits for its moment.
