# 🎥 FRAME 10 — RICHARD'S CATASTROPHE
#
# Camera: ACM1 "Leela Cam"
# Timestamp: 23:48:00
#
# THE IRONY MANIFESTS:
# Richard Bartle, father of MUDs, author of player taxonomy,
# designer of virtual worlds...
#
# ...walks into the painted tunnel thinking it's a fire exit.
#
# THE TAXONOMY OF THIS MOMENT:
# - Achiever? He's about to achieve WALL CONTACT
# - Explorer? He's about to EXPLORE solid brick
# - Socializer? He's about to MEET the paint
# - Killer? The tunnel is about to KILL his dignity
#
# Meanwhile: Don is now fully rabbit, hopping in panic.

  context:
    - "Richard just arrived, adjusting glasses"
    - "Don is mid-rabbit-transformation"
    - "Building fully engulfed"
    - "Concentric circle tunnels glowing"
    - "Richard gave permission to be simulated"

    action: "Richard walks confidently toward the blue tunnel, assuming it's an exit"

        "Ah, there appears to be a passage on the left.
         Blue lighting — emergency exit perhaps?
         The perspective suggests depth.
         I shall investigate and possibly assist any—"
         
      action: "WALKING INTO THE PAINTED TUNNEL"
      
      the_impact: |
        THWACK.
        
        But different from Don's THWACK.
        
        This is an ACADEMIC THWACK.
        A THEORETICAL THWACK.
        The THWACK of someone who literally
        designed virtual physics
        discovering that cartoon physics
        doesn't care about his credentials.
        
        His glasses fly off.
        His messenger bag swings.
        His dignity... restructures.

      Richard Bartle:
      - DESIGNED the concept of virtual space
      - WROTE about how perception shapes reality in games
      - THEORIZED about the nature of presence
      
      Richard Bartle just now:
      - Perceived depth where there was only paint
      - Experienced a reality he didn't design
      - Is PRESENT in the most physical way possible
      
      THE TAXONOMY APPLIED:
      In this moment, Richard is ALL FOUR types simultaneously:
      - ACHIEVER: Achieved impact
      - EXPLORER: Explored the wall's surface
      - SOCIALIZER: Intimate contact with brick
      - KILLER: His assumptions killed
      
    don_meanwhile:
      status: "FULL RABBIT MODE"
      behavior: |
        Don is no longer walking.
        Don is HOPPING.
        
        Full rabbit panic. Zigzag pattern.
        Ears fully erect. Nose maximum twitch.
        Eyes: pure prey animal terror.
        
        He's trying to warn Richard but can only:
        "SQUEAK! SQUEAK! SQUEAK!"
        
        The tie-dye jacket now looks like natural coloring.
        He IS a rabbit now. A very confused, very colorful rabbit.

  visual_elements:
    richard: "Mid-impact with blue tunnel wall, glasses flying"
    don: "FULL RABBIT — hopping in panic, zigzag pattern"
    tunnels: "Blue one (impact site), Orange one (watching)"
    building: "Still burning, background chaos"
    
  narrative_beat: |
    Chekhov's Tunnel: FIRED AGAIN.
    
    This time at the man who could have predicted it,
    if only cartoon physics followed game theory.
    
    They don't.
    They really don't.
