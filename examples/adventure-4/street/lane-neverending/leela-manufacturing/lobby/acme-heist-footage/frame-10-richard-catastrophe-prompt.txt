Night surveillance camera footage. Pixar-adjacent stylized CGI with security camera aesthetic.

CRITICAL ACTION: Distinguished older gentleman with white beard (RICHARD) has just WALKED INTO the painted blue tunnel on the wall and is hitting it! Classic cartoon IMPACT — body pressed against flat wall, glasses FLYING OFF, messenger bag swinging, arms splayed. The tunnel is clearly PAINT on brick — he thought it was a real passage!

SIMULTANEOUSLY: A RABBIT-MAN (Don) in tie-dye is HOPPING in panic nearby — this is a human with FULL RABBIT FEATURES (long ears, rabbit face, but wearing tie-dye hoodie). Zigzag hopping pattern, prey animal terror.

BACKGROUND: Building FULLY ENGULFED in flames, multiple stories. Concentric circle patterns glowing (blue where Richard hit, orange on right side).

COMPOSITION: Richard mid-impact with wall, glasses airborne. Rabbit-Don hopping frantically. Third figure (instigator) watching in horror.

MOOD: Academic meets absurd. Maximum irony. The game designer experiencing cartoon physics.

Style: Surveillance footage, capturing the catastrophic ironic moment, fire glow, chaos.
