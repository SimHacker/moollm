  narrative_beat: |
    The Leela Cam catches movement.
    
    Two figures cross Lane Neverending from the south side.
    One walks with purpose — they've been here before, or pretend to have.
    One walks with curiosity — Don Hopkins, invited but not warned.
    
    They're heading toward ACME Surplus.
    The painted tunnel is visible on the facade, catching streetlight.
    A faded "EVERYTHING MUST GO" sign hangs askew.
    
    Somewhere in the basement, a monitor flickers.
    Donna leans forward in her throne.
    
    "Well well WELL. Look who's crossing MY street."

    CAMERA: ACM1, security footage perspective
    ANGLE: Slightly elevated, wide shot, minor fisheye distortion
    TIME: Night — sodium streetlamp amber with patches of shadow
    
    THE STREET:
    Lane Neverending stretches left-right across frame.
    Empty at this hour. A distant car's taillights disappearing east.
    Streetlamps pool orange light at intervals.
    
    THE BUILDING (background):
    ACME SURPLUS dominates the frame — abandoned storefront aesthetic.
    Dusty windows. "EVERYTHING MUST GO" sign faded and crooked.
    The PAINTED TUNNEL clearly visible on the facade — fake depth, 
    oddly convincing in the low light.
    "CLOSED INDEFINITELY" placard on the door.
    
    THE FIGURES (middle ground):
    Two people crossing from bottom of frame toward building.
    
    FIGURE 1 (THE INSTIGATOR):
    Walking slightly ahead. Confident posture. Hand gesturing
    toward the building as if presenting a gift.
    
    FIGURE 2 (DON HOPKINS):
    Larger silhouette. Hawaiian shirt barely visible under jacket.
    Glasses catching streetlight. Head tilted — curious but not alarmed.
    Body language: "This seems interesting."
    
    DETAILS:
    - Timestamp overlay: "ACM1 — 2026-01-22 — 23:07:42"
    - Slight grain/compression artifacts (security footage aesthetic)
    - A rat scurrying along the building's base (optional)
    - The painted tunnel seems to GLOW slightly (sodium light trick?)

      posture: "Confident, presenting, leading"
      identifiable: false  # Too dark, surveillance distance
      
    don_hopkins:
      position: "Crossing street, slightly behind instigator"
      posture: "Curious, following, trusting"
      identifiable: "Partially — large frame, glasses, pattern shirt implied"

    commentary: |
      "Well well WELL. Look who's crossing MY street.
       
       Two of them! TWO! Very ambitious. Very FOOLISH.
       
       The big one... I've seen that shape before somewhere.
       The other one knows better but does it ANYWAY.
       
       TREMENDOUS. This is going to be TREMENDOUS."
       
  environment_notes:
    time_of_day: "Late night (~23:00)"
    lighting: "Sodium streetlamps — amber pools, deep shadows"
    weather: "Clear, slight chill implied"
    ambient_sound: "Distant traffic, electric hum, rat footsteps"
    
  foreshadowing:
    - "The painted tunnel seems to glow (it's always watching)"
    - "The 'CLOSED' sign is a warning they're ignoring"
    - "No other pedestrians — witnesses? None."
    - "The building seems to LEAN toward them (perspective trick?)"
    
  visual_style: |
    Security camera aesthetic — wide angle, surveillance distance.
    
    COLOR PALETTE:
    - Sodium amber from streetlights
    - Deep shadow black between pools
    - Building facade in muted browns and grays
    - Painted tunnel with uncanny depth
    
    GRAIN/ARTIFACTS:
    - Slight horizontal scan lines
    - Compression blocks in dark areas
    - Timestamp burned into frame
    - The look of footage that will be EVIDENCE
    
  narrative_moment:
    just_before: "Don received an invitation. 'Come see ACME. It'll be fun.'"
    right_now: "Crossing the point of no return. The building waits."
    just_after: "They will reach the door. They will try to enter."
    always: "Every heist starts with someone crossing a street."
    
  donna_foreshadowing: |
    "You know what I LOVE about this moment?
     
     They think they're the PREDATORS. They think they're SNEAKING.
     But I've been watching them since they left the pub.
     I SAW them planning. I HEARD them laughing.
     
     Now they're on MY side of the street.
     
     And they don't even know I'm HERE."
