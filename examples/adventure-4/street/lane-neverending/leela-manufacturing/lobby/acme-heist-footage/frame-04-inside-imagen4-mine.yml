# Frame 04 Mining — THE TUNNEL MULTIPLIES
#
# MAJOR EMERGENCE: The painted tunnel is now on BOTH SIDES of the building.
# CHEKHOV'S TUNNEL is REPLICATING. The trap is closing.
# The building itself is becoming a tunnel.
#
# They thought they were entering a store.
# They're entering a DIMENSION.

# LAYER 1: THE TUNNEL PHENOMENON
layer_tunnel_analysis:
  frame_01: "Tunnel visible on RIGHT side of facade"
  frame_02: "Tunnel dominates RIGHT side — 40% of frame"
  frame_03: "Tunnel visible on RIGHT, watching the anvil moment"
  frame_04: "TUNNELS ON BOTH SIDES — LEFT AND RIGHT"
  
  progression: |
    The tunnel is SPREADING.
    
    Each frame, it grows. Each frame, it multiplies.
    First one tunnel. Now TWO.
    
    The checkered perspective pattern has migrated to the LEFT side
    of the building as well. The figures are now FRAMED BY TUNNELS.
    
    The door — their entrance, their potential exit — is a narrow
    channel between two infinite voids.
    
  interpretation: |
    ACME SURPLUS is not a building. It's a TOPOLOGY.
    
    The painted tunnels aren't decoration. They're REAL.
    Not real in the sense of "you can walk through them."
    Real in the sense of "they define the space."
    
    The figures entered thinking they were breaking into a store.
    They entered a DIMENSION where ACME physics apply.
    
    The tunnels are the walls of this dimension.
    The products are the furniture.
    Donna is the god.
    
  chekhov_update: |
    CHEKHOV'S TUNNEL is now CHEKHOV'S TUNNELS (plural).
    
    When someone tries to escape, they'll have to CHOOSE:
    - Left tunnel?
    - Right tunnel?
    - The door between them?
    
    ALL OPTIONS lead to *THWACK*.
    
# LAYER 2: DON AT THE THRESHOLD
layer_don:
  position: "At the door, half in/half out"
  expression: "Deeply concerned. Processing. Reconsidering."
  
  the_jacket:
    description: "TIE-DYE PSYCHEDELIC MASTERPIECE"
    colors: ["Orange", "Yellow", "Green", "Blue"]
    pattern: "Swirling, organic, alive"
    contrast: "MAXIMUM against industrial interior"
    
    significance: |
      Don's jacket is the only ORGANIC element in this frame.
      
      Everything else is industrial: shelves, boxes, concrete, tunnels.
      His jacket is tie-dye chaos — natural, flowing, ALIVE.
      
      He doesn't belong here. The jacket SCREAMS this.
      He's color in a world of geometry.
      He's life in a warehouse of products.
      
      The jacket makes him a TARGET.
      And maybe, in some way, a PROTAGONIST.
      
  body_language: |
    He hasn't committed yet.
    
    One foot in, one foot... possible to retreat?
    Looking into the depths where his friend has gone.
    Seeing the scale of this place.
    Seeing the tunnels on either side.
    
    This is the last moment of choice.
    After this, he's IN.
    
# LAYER 3: THE WAREHOUSE REVEALED
layer_warehouse:
  scale: "MASSIVE — industrial distribution center"
  not_what_we_expected: true
  
  previous_impression: "Abandoned small storefront"
  actual_reality: "Full-scale ACME distribution warehouse"
  
  contents_visible:
    shelving: "Industrial orange/metal racks, floor to ceiling"
    boxes: "ACME branded boxes EVERYWHERE"
    depth: "The warehouse extends FAR — can't see the back"
    lighting: "Industrial fixtures, warm amber"
    aisles: "Multiple aisles radiating from entrance"
    
  emergence_note: |
    THE STORE IS BIGGER ON THE INSIDE.
    
    From outside, it looked like a regular storefront.
    From inside, it's a WAREHOUSE.
    
    This is ACME. Space doesn't work right here.
    The painted tunnels aren't the only impossible geometry.
    The entire building is a spatial anomaly.
    
# LAYER 4: THE INSTIGATOR'S TRAJECTORY
layer_instigator:
  position: "DEEP inside — 50+ feet from entrance"
  action: "Walking deeper, flashlight illuminating path"
  awareness: "Still oblivious. Still exploring."
  
  trajectory: |
    He's leading them deeper.
    
    Every step takes them further from the exit.
    Every step takes them deeper into ACME space.
    Every step increases Donna's options.
    
    He doesn't know about the tunnels multiplying.
    He doesn't know about the warehouse's scale.
    He just sees PRODUCTS and OPPORTUNITY.
    
    Poor Gesture Gary. He has no idea.
    
# LAYER 5: DONNA'S VIEW
layer_donna:
  reaction: |
    "OH that's BEAUTIFUL.
     
     Look at them. Look at FANCY PANTS at the door.
     That JACKET! In MY warehouse! The AUDACITY!
     
     He's hesitating. Smart. But too late.
     
     His friend is already deep. The tunnel's behind him.
     The TUNNELS, plural — YES, I noticed them too.
     That happens sometimes when people stay too long.
     
     The building RESPONDS to intruders.
     The tunnels MULTIPLY to cut off escape.
     
     It's not a trap. It's an IMMUNE SYSTEM.
     
     And those two? They're the INFECTION.
     
     My warehouse is about to demonstrate ANTIBODIES."
     
  next_action: |
    "Gesture Gary is heading toward PROPULSION aisle.
     
     Rocket skates? Jet packs? Spring shoes?
     
     OH! I know! The CONVEYOR BELT!
     
     Once he steps on that, the tour becomes MANDATORY."
     
# LAYER 6: THE CLOSED SIGN
layer_closed_sign:
  position: "On glass door, clearly visible"
  meaning: "Warning that was ignored"
  
  irony: |
    The CLOSED sign now means something different.
    
    Before: "Store not open for business"
    Now: "Your escape route is CLOSED"
    
    They're on the wrong side of the glass.
    The sign faces THEM now.
    CLOSED. Locked. Trapped.
    
# NARRATIVE MOMENT
narrative_moment:
  just_before: "The anvil. The entry. The door still open behind them."
  right_now: "The scope of the mistake becomes clear. WAREHOUSE. TUNNELS. LOCKED."
  just_after: "Don follows his friend deeper. Or tries the door. Or freezes."
  always: "The moment you realize you're in over your head."
  
# CONTEXT FOR FRAME 05
context_for_frame_05:
  critical_developments:
    - "The tunnels have MULTIPLIED — now on both sides"
    - "The store is a WAREHOUSE — bigger on inside"
    - "Don is at threshold, still has moment of choice"
    - "Instigator is deep inside, oblivious"
    - "ACME boxes visible everywhere"
    
  chekhov_status:
    tunnels: "MULTIPLIED — now two loaded guns"
    warehouse: "REVEALED — full ACME inventory at play"
    products: "VISIBLE — specific traps can now be triggered"
    
  frame_05_prediction: |
    DEEPER TROUBLE — The tour begins.
    
    Either:
    A) Don follows deeper, sees something alarming
    B) Instigator triggers conveyor/propulsion
    C) Donna makes her presence KNOWN (PA, trap, or both)
    
    The tunnels watch from both sides.
    Waiting for the chase that's coming.
