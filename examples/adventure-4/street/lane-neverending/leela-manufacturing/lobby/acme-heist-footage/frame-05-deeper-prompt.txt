Night surveillance camera footage of ACME SURPLUS storefront. Pixar-adjacent stylized CGI with security camera aesthetic — timestamp overlay, slight grain, wide angle.

EXTERIOR: Building facade with painted checkered perspective tunnels on BOTH SIDES of the entrance, slightly GLOWING with eerie light. "ACME SURPLUS" sign lit. Street visible in foreground.

THROUGH THE WINDOWS — THE MAIN ACTION:
Interior chaos visible through large front windows. A CONVEYOR BELT is RUNNING — industrial orange/metal, boxes moving along it. ONE FIGURE is ON the conveyor belt, being carried toward the back of the warehouse, arms flailing.

SECOND FIGURE (Don in colorful jacket) visible deeper inside, arms raised in alarm, watching his friend get conveyed away.

SHELVES with ACME boxes visible. Some products FALLING. Industrial lighting FLICKERING dramatically.

LIGHTING: Night exterior, sodium streetlight amber. Interior bright through windows, industrial fixtures, some flickering.

MOOD: The heist has become a RIDE. Chaos glimpsed through windows. The building is ACTIVE.

Style: Security footage aesthetic, surveillance voyeurism, watching something go wrong from across the street.
