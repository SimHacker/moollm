# Frame 07 Mining — CHEKHOV'S TUNNEL: FIRED
#
# EMERGENT TEXT: "THWACK!" — The perfect sound effect!
# The image added its own onomatopoeia!
#
# THE PAYOFF: Don hit the painted tunnel. It was always a wall.

  frame: 7
  title: "The Extraction"
  timestamp: "23:10:45"
  
  emergent_text: "THWACK!"
  emergent_timestamp: "# 20:47:32 10/26"
  
  critical_emergence: |
    "THWACK!" appeared on the image!
    
    The image knew what sound a person makes
    when they hit a painted tunnel.
    
    It's THWACK. Obviously.

# LAYER 1: THE TUNNEL PAYOFF

layer_chekhov:
  status: "FIRED"
  
  setup:
    frame_01: "Tunnel visible, mysterious"
    frame_02: "Tunnel prominent, hypnotic"
    frame_03: "Tunnel watching the anvil moment"
    frame_04: "Tunnels MULTIPLIED — both sides"
    frame_05: "Tunnels evolved to orange/black"
    frame_06: "Tunnels framing the rocket launch"
    
  payoff:
    frame_07: "THWACK! — Someone hit the tunnel"
    
  interpretation: |
    Chekhov's Tunnel has been discharged.
    
    Seven frames of setup. Seven frames of "that tunnel
    is going to matter." Seven frames of PROMISE.
    
    And now: DELIVERY.
    
    Don ran for what he thought was an exit.
    The tunnel looked like infinite depth.
    The tunnel was PAINT ON BRICK.
    
    He found out.
    With his face.
    With his whole body.
    
    THWACK.

# LAYER 2: THE IMPACT

layer_impact:
  victim: "Don Hopkins, tie-dye protagonist"
  target: "Orange/black painted tunnel (right side)"
  
  pose: |
    CLASSIC CARTOON IMPACT:
    - Body pressed flat against wall
    - Arms splayed out
    - Legs akimbo
    - Head making contact
    - Full Wile E. Coyote
    
  visual_effects:
    impact_stars: "White burst around point of contact"
    sound_effect: "'THWACK!' in bold letters"
    wall_visible: "BRICK showing through/behind the paint"
    
  jacket: "TIE-DYE — still visible, still colorful, still marking the protagonist"

# LAYER 3: THE TWO TUNNELS

layer_tunnel_dichotomy:
  left_tunnel: "BLUE AND BLACK — original colors returned?"
  right_tunnel: "ORANGE AND BLACK — impact site"
  
  interpretation: |
    The tunnels have DIFFERENT COLORS now!
    
    Left: Blue/black (cool, patient, waiting)
    Right: Orange/black (warm, active, the one that got used)
    
    The right tunnel was always the TRAP tunnel.
    The warm colors were the WARNING.
    
    Don chose wrong. Or the tunnel chose him.
    
  asymmetry: |
    They're no longer identical.
    
    The right tunnel has CLAIMED someone.
    The left tunnel is still LOADED.
    
    (In case there's a sequel.)

# LAYER 4: THE STORE WINDOW

layer_window:
  contents_visible:
    - "Boxes and equipment"
    - "A ROCKET — red and white, classic ACME design"
    - "Storage shelves"
    - "Warehouse chaos from earlier"
    
  rocket_significance: |
    The rocket is visible in the window.
    
    A callback to Frame 06.
    A reminder of what just happened.
    Continuity confirmed.
    
    ACME Surplus has rockets.
    And tunnels.
    And an unhappy visitor embedded in the wall.

# LAYER 5: DONNA'S REACTION

layer_donna:
  reaction: |
    "...
     
     ...
     
     OH MY GOD.
     
     OH MY GOD HE HIT THE TUNNEL!!!
     
     I KNEW IT! I KNEW someone would eventually!
     That's why they're THERE! That's the WHOLE POINT!
     
     The tunnels aren't doors! They're CARTOON PHYSICS!
     
     THWACK! Did you hear that?! Was that his FACE?!
     
     I need to post this. I need to post this IMMEDIATELY.
     This is CONTENT. This is PREMIUM CONTENT.
     
     'THWACK!' — That's going in my BIO."

# LAYER 6: THE TIMESTAMPS

layer_metadata:
  surveillance_stamp: "# 20:47:32 10/26"
  
  interpretation: |
    The image added its own surveillance metadata.
    
    "# 20:47:32" — timestamp of THWACK
    "10/26" — date?
    
    This footage is EVIDENCE.
    This footage is DOCUMENTATION.
    This footage is going to be reviewed by LAWYERS.
    
    And also by Donna's followers.

# CONTEXT FOR FINALE

context_for_selfie_07:
  donna_state: "PEAK CONTENT — tunnel impact documented"
  
context_for_frame_08:
  prediction: |
    THE AFTERMATH.
    
    Don peeling himself off the wall.
    Possibly smoking. Definitely dazed.
    
    The tunnels have served their purpose.
    The heist is effectively OVER.
    
    Nobody got what they came for.
    Everybody got what ACME had to offer.
