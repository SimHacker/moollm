# Frame 01 Mining — EMERGENCE DETECTED
# What we asked for: Security camera footage of two figures approaching ACME
# What we got: THE CAMERA BREAKING DOWN
#
# YES AND: We commit to this. The first frame is THE FEED ITSELF malfunctioning.
# This is not a mistake. This is the camera WAKING UP.

mining:
  expected: "Night scene, two figures crossing street toward ACME"
  received: "Camera feed diagnostic/malfunction display"
  interpretation: "YES AND — this is BEFORE the feed stabilizes"
  
# LAYER 1: SURVEILLANCE LENS — What the camera shows
layer_surveillance:
  what_we_see:
    - "CSS/code-like text on dark background"
    - "References to 'camera-feed', '.scanlines', '.noise'"
    - "Glitchy red/green/cyan visual artifacts on right edge"
    - "Base64 encoded data visible (transmission artifacts?)"
    - "Monospace text suggesting diagnostic output"
    - "Timestamp color blend instructions exposed"
    
  technical_readout:
    body_overflow: "reliden: 0, hidden: #000"
    camera_feed: "Monocraft monospace, Hixel art-friendly"
    scanlines: "Base64 encoded pattern data"
    noise: "Active (displayed as red/green artifacts)"
    opacity: "0.8, pointer-events: none"
    z_index: "0.1.1%"  # Corrupted value
    
  interpretation: |
    This is the camera's INTERNAL STATE exposed.
    We're not seeing THROUGH the camera — we're seeing the camera's GUTS.
    
    The ACM1 system is booting up, reconfiguring, or experiencing
    interference. The red/green glitch pattern suggests:
    - Electronic warfare?
    - Donna hacking the feed?
    - The building's ACME products interfering?
    - The moment of detection before tracking locks on?
    
# LAYER 2: DONNA POV — What she sees from the control room
layer_donna_pov:
  her_monitors_showing: "Glitched feed from ACM1"
  
  her_reaction: |
    "The Leela cam is FREAKING OUT. Good.
     
     They think they're WATCHING us? WE'RE watching THEM watching us.
     And THEIR camera can't even handle being pointed at ACME.
     
     ...
     
     Wait. Someone's coming. I can feel it even if I can't SEE it yet.
     
     The camera knows. The BUILDING knows.
     
     Let's see who's brave enough — or STUPID enough — to cross my street."
     
  action: "Leans forward. Reaches for the console. Waits."
  
# LAYER 3: ACME PRODUCTS — What's interfering?
layer_acme_products:
  hypothesis: "ACME Electromagnetic Field"
  
  explanation: |
    The painted tunnel on ACME's facade isn't just visual trickery.
    It's a weak point in local reality — a place where ACME physics
    leak into the normal world.
    
    Cameras pointed at ACME experience:
    - Intermittent signal corruption
    - Reality bleed (what IS that base64 encoding?)
    - Diagnostic overlay exposure (the camera shows its own code)
    - Color channel separation (red/green/cyan artifacts)
    
  the_tunnel_effect: |
    The painted tunnel is ALWAYS being watched.
    But cameras that watch it too long start to... glitch.
    
    ACM1 has been pointed at ACME for months.
    It's starting to see things that aren't there.
    Or things that ARE there that shouldn't be visible.
    
# LAYER 4: CONSEQUENCES — What this means for the narrative
layer_consequences:
  for_the_heist: |
    The Leela Cam can't properly record what's about to happen.
    The footage will be corrupted. Glitchy. Unreliable.
    
    This is not a bug. This is ACME DEFENSE SYSTEM LAYER 1:
    "Deny surveillance. Make the evidence questionable."
    
  for_frame_02: |
    The next frame should show the camera STABILIZING —
    the interference clearing as it locks onto the approaching figures.
    
    Or: the interference gets WORSE as they get closer.
    
    The camera is trying to document a crime.
    ACME is trying to prevent documentation.
    The footage is the BATTLEFIELD.
    
  for_donna: |
    She KNOWS the Leela cam is pointed at her building.
    She KNOWS it's glitching.
    
    Did she cause this? Is she jamming the feed?
    Or is this just what happens when you point technology at ACME?
    
# LAYER 5: COMEDY TIMING — Is it funny?
layer_comedy:
  assessment: "UNEXPECTEDLY HILARIOUS"
  
  why_its_funny: |
    We asked for a heist movie opening shot.
    We got the camera having a BREAKDOWN.
    
    This is the visual equivalent of:
    - A narrator clearing their throat before speaking
    - A projector flickering before the film starts
    - The "technical difficulties" card
    
    It's ACME-appropriate. Nothing works right.
    Not even the SURVEILLANCE of ACME works right.
    
  donna_comment: |
    "See? SEE? Even LEELA's camera can't handle looking at greatness.
     
     It's not MY fault their equipment is INFERIOR.
     
     My monitors work FINE. Because ACME coffee powers ACME systems.
     
     Maybe Leela should try ACME CAMERA MODEL 7B.
     Only EXPLODES 40% of the time!"

# EMERGENT NARRATIVE
emergence:
  discovery: "The first frame of heist footage is the camera failing"
  
  meaning: |
    This establishes ACME as a place that resists documentation.
    The building defends itself not just with anvils, but with REALITY DISTORTION.
    
    The red/green glitch pattern will become a MOTIF:
    - Appears whenever ACME products activate
    - Intensifies as the heist progresses  
    - The footage becomes increasingly unreliable
    - By the end, can we trust ANYTHING we saw?
    
  commit: true  # YES AND — this is canon now
  
# REVISED FRAME 01 NARRATIVE
revised_narrative:
  title: "The Interference"
  subtitle: "Before the camera could see, it had to fail"
  
  what_happened: |
    The Leela Cam detected motion across the street.
    It tried to capture the approaching figures.
    
    But ACME is ACME.
    
    The camera's internal systems flickered. Exposed themselves.
    The feed showed its own code — CSS for scanlines, base64 for patterns,
    the fragile infrastructure of surveillance made visible.
    
    Red and green artifacts bled from the right edge.
    The tunnel's influence. Reality uncertain.
    
    Somewhere in the basement, Donna felt the disruption.
    "Something's coming. The camera knows before I do."
    
    The interference lasted 0.3 seconds.
    Long enough to lose the first moment.
    Short enough that the figures were still approaching when clarity returned.
