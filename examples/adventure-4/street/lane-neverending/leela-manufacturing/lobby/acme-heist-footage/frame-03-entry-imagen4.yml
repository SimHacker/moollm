  Security camera footage, surveillance aesthetic, night scene. Timestamp "ACM1 — 2026-01-22 — 23:08:47". Motion blur, grain, the look of something HAPPENING.
  
  THE MOMENT: The front door of ACME SURPLUS has just OPENED. Two figures are stepping through the threshold into darkness. ABOVE THE DOOR, an ANVIL on a rope is SWINGING DOWN toward them — classic cartoon trap in motion.
  
  THE DOOR: Open now, revealing dark interior beyond. The "CLOSED" sign still visible, ignored. Light from outside illuminating the threshold.
  
  THE FIGURES:
  - FIGURE 1 (instigator): At or through the doorway, body reacting to movement above — either not yet aware or starting to dodge.
  - FIGURE 2 (Don, colorful patterned jacket): Following through door, looking UP at something, expression shifting from curiosity to alarm.
  
  THE ANVIL: A massive metal anvil swinging on a rope from above the door frame. Motion blur showing its arc. The rope visible, taut with tension. The anvil at head-height, mid-swing. This is the ACME Security Anvil Model 7B — the greeting.
  
  THE BUILDING: Dark interior visible through open door — silhouettes of empty shelves. The black-and-white PAINTED TUNNEL still visible on the facade to the right (Chekhov's Tunnel watching). Streetlamp casting warm light from behind the figures.
  
  MOTION ELEMENTS: Blur on the anvil showing speed. Figures' clothes/hair disturbed by air movement. The chaos of the first trap springing.
  
  LIGHTING: Streetlamp amber from behind. Dark interior ahead. The anvil catching light as it swings through the threshold.
  
  MOOD: IMPACT. The first trap. The welcome. The moment when "this seemed like fun" becomes "what have we done."
  
  STYLE: Pixar-adjacent CGI with surveillance texture. Motion and action. The frame that will be labeled "EXHIBIT A."
