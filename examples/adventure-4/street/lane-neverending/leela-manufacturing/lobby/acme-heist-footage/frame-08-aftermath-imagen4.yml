  Night surveillance camera footage of ACME SURPLUS storefront. Pixar-adjacent stylized CGI with security camera aesthetic. FINAL FRAME of the heist.
  
  SURVIVORS: Two figures standing on the OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE STREET (near camera position), looking BACK at the ACME building. Both disheveled — one in torn TIE-DYE JACKET holding his head, other leaning/exhausted. Both slightly smoking/sooty. The "we survived" pose.
  
  THE BUILDING: ACME SURPLUS facade showing aftermath — windows on both sides SHATTERED, glass on sidewalk. Painted tunnels (blue/black on left, orange/black on right) still intact, still hypnotic. "ACME SURPLUS" sign still lit. Interior visible through broken windows — chaos, fallen boxes.
  
  COMPOSITION: Wide shot — survivors in foreground looking back, building in background. The "we made it but barely" moment.
  
  MOOD: Aftermath calm. The chaos has ended. The building is patient. It will wait for next time.
  
  Style: Security footage aesthetic, final tableau, night scene, the end of the heist.
