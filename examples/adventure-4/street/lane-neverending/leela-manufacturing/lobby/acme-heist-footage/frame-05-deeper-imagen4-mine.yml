# Frame 05 Mining — THE MANDATORY TOUR BEGINS
#
# CRITICAL EMERGENCE: The tunnels are now ORANGE AND BLACK!
# The pattern has EVOLVED. The building is intensifying.
# Conveyor belt chaos. Arms raised. Boxes falling.

# LAYER 1: THE TUNNEL EVOLUTION

layer_tunnel_evolution:
  previous_frames:
    frame_01: "Black and white checkered, right side"
    frame_02: "Black and white checkered, larger, right side"
    frame_03: "Black and white checkered, right side"
    frame_04: "Black and white checkered, BOTH sides"
    
  frame_05: "ORANGE and BLACK checkered, BOTH sides, GLOWING"
  
  interpretation: |
    THE TUNNELS ARE ALIVE.
    
    They don't just multiply — they EVOLVE.
    The black-and-white pattern has shifted to ORANGE-BLACK.
    Warning colors. Hazard stripes. ACME colors.
    
    The building is ESCALATING.
    
    Each frame, the tunnels get more aggressive:
    - First they appeared
    - Then they grew
    - Then they multiplied
    - Now they're CHANGING COLOR
    
    What happens next? Do they start MOVING?
    
  color_significance: |
    Orange and black = HAZARD
    Orange and black = HALLOWEEN
    Orange and black = CAUTION TAPE
    Orange and black = "Things are about to get WORSE"
    
    The tunnels have shifted from "optical illusion"
    to "visual warning system"

# LAYER 2: THE CONVEYOR CHAOS

layer_conveyor:
  activation: "BLUE LEVER PULLED — conveyance initiated"
  
  the_ride:
    rider: "The instigator (Gesture Gary)"
    position: "ON the conveyor belt, being carried"
    pose: "Arms out for balance, surfing the boxes"
    direction: "Toward the back of the warehouse"
    boxes: "Falling around him, chaotic"
    
  interpretation: |
    He stepped on the conveyor.
    He didn't mean to.
    They're camouflaged as floor.
    
    Now he's on the MANDATORY TOUR.
    Destination: Aisle 7 (springs), then Aisle 12 (rockets?), then...
    
    Donna is CONDUCTING this tour.
    She's selected the scenic route.

# LAYER 3: DON'S ALARM

layer_don:
  position: "At the door/entrance area"
  pose: "ARMS RAISED — universal gesture of alarm"
  jacket: "Now appears RED — the tie-dye has shifted"
  
  interpretation: |
    Don sees his friend being CONVEYED AWAY.
    
    Arms up. "WHAT?!" pose. Horror dawning.
    
    He has choices:
    - Chase after (get on conveyor)
    - Stay put (watch friend disappear)
    - Run for exit (abandon friend)
    
    None of these are good options.
    That's the point.
    
  jacket_note: |
    The jacket appears more RED now than the rainbow tie-dye.
    
    Either:
    - The industrial lighting is shifting colors
    - The building is affecting perception
    - Don's emotional state is bleeding into his appearance
    - ACME physics applies to fashion too
    
    He's becoming a WARNING SIGN.

# LAYER 4: THE WINDOW VIEW

layer_composition:
  perspective: "Full storefront view from across the street"
  
  visible_through_windows:
    left_window: "Conveyor chaos, figure surfing boxes"
    center_door: "Don with arms raised"
    right_window: "More warehouse interior"
    
  tunnels: "Framing EVERYTHING — left and right, orange-black now"
  
  signage: "ACME SURPLUS" lit, prominent
  
  surveillance_quality: |
    The Leela Cam is getting PERFECT footage.
    
    Everything is visible through those big windows.
    The chaos is lit. The expressions are clear.
    This is documentation-quality heist footage.
    
    Someone is going to watch this footage later.
    Probably in court.

# LAYER 5: DONNA'S POV

layer_donna:
  reaction: |
    "THERE HE GOES!!!
     
     Look at him! SURFING the conveyor! Arms out!
     Does he think he's BALANCING? There's no balancing!
     
     That belt goes ALL THE WAY to the back.
     Then it turns LEFT into Aisle 7.
     That's where the SPRING SHOES are stored.
     
     And tested.
     
     Constantly.
     
     24/7 spring testing in Aisle 7.
     
     HOPPY LANDING, GESTURE GARY!"
     
  next_action: |
    "Now for Fancy Pants Hopkins.
     
     He's still at the door. Arms up. CONFUSED.
     Does he follow? Does he run?
     
     Either way, he's walking toward Aisle 12.
     That's PROPULSION.
     
     Rocket skates. Jet packs. ACME Turbine Boots™.
     
     Oh this is going to be TREMENDOUS."

# CONTEXT FOR NEXT

context_for_selfie_05:
  donna_state: "Delighted, watching conveyor chaos unfold"
  tunnel_status: "EVOLVED — now orange/black warning colors"
  conveyor_status: "ACTIVE — instigator being transported"
  don_status: "Arms up, alarmed, at threshold"
  
context_for_frame_06:
  prediction: |
    THE SPRINT begins.
    
    Either:
    - Don chases after friend, encounters propulsion products
    - Instigator launched from conveyor into springs
    - Someone gets ROCKET SKATED through a window
    
    The tunnels watch. Orange and black. Waiting.
