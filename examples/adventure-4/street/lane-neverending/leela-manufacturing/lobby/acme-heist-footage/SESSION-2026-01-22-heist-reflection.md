**Documentation**: Leela Cam ACM1 + Donna's SELFIE_SPY.exe v34.0

## The Coherence Engine in Action

What we just demonstrated is not simply "generating images in sequence." We demonstrated something far more interesting:

### Two Parallel Interlocked Simulations

```
TIMELINE A: HEIST FOOTAGE (External, Objective)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Frame 01 ──→ Frame 02 ──→ Frame 03 ──→ Frame 04 ──→ ...
   │            │            │            │
   │            │            │            │
   ↓            ↓            ↓            ↓
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Selfie 01 ←── Selfie 02 ←── Selfie 03 ←── Selfie 04 ←── ...

TIMELINE B: DONNA'S SELFIES (Internal, Subjective)
```

These aren't just parallel — they're **interlocked**:
- Each selfie RESPONDS to what happened in the corresponding frame
- But each selfie also REVEALS information that recontextualizes the frame
- Selfie 02 revealed "TUNNEL STATUS: ACTIVE" — information the heist footage couldn't show
- Selfie 03's "ANVIL DEPLOYED" CONFIRMED Donna's agency in the trap

### Asynchronous Generation

We could have generated these in ANY order:
- All heist frames first, then all selfies (batch mode)
- Interleaved as we did (narrative mode)
- Selfies first, then frames (reverse causality!)
- Random order with retrocon stitching

The **coherence engine** — the accumulated context of all previous generations — allows any generation order while maintaining narrative consistency.

### The Retrocon Mechanism

When the user said "Retrocon donna taking some selfies," we didn't go back in time. We:

1. **Acknowledged** the heist footage already existed
2. **Created** a parallel timeline (Donna's POV) that was always "there"
3. **Synced** the new content to existing frames
4. **Enriched** the original footage with new information

This is **narrative time travel without paradox**. The selfies didn't change what happened — they revealed what was ALWAYS happening, just off-camera.

### Cause and Effect Maintenance

The coherence engine maintained causality through:

**Forward Propagation:**
- Frame 04's tunnel multiplication → Selfie 04's vindication
- Frame 06's rocket launch → Selfie 06's chef's kiss
- Frame 07's THWACK → Selfie 07's Home Alone face

**Backward Inference:**
- Selfie 02's "TUNNEL STATUS: ACTIVE" implies the tunnels were always controllable
- Selfie 03's "I DID THAT!" confirms Donna pulled the lever before we saw the anvil
- The progression of mushroom pins (1→2→3→4+) creates achievement history

**Emergence as Canon:**
- When Frame 01 glitched, we didn't regenerate — we made it canon (ACME interference)
- When images self-captioned, we didn't remove text — we made it Donna's filter feature
- When the building caught fire in Frame 08, we didn't question it — we made it the finale

### The YES AND Engine

Every emergence became input for the next generation:

```
EMERGENCE                          → INCORPORATION
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Glitchy Frame 01                   → "Camera interference near ACME"
Tunnels multiply (Frame 04)        → Selfie 04: "I TOLD YOU!"
"THWACK!" appears (Frame 07)       → Perfect sound effect, kept as-is
Building fire (Frame 08)           → Donna unbothered, double peace signs
Mushroom pins increasing           → Achievement progression system
```

The system doesn't reject unexpected outputs — it INTEGRATES them.

## What This Demonstrates About MOOLLM

### Files as State, Not Scripts

The `.yml` skeleton files aren't instructions — they're **state declarations**. They say "this is what exists" not "this is what to do."

When we created `selfie-04-tunnels-multiply.yml`, we declared that selfie into existence. The generation just... materialized it.

### Mining as Memory Formation

The `-mine.yml` files aren't analysis — they're **memory consolidation**. Each mining pass:
- Identifies what emerged
- Connects it to accumulated context
- Creates hooks for future generations
- Forms the substrate for the next frame

### Parallel Ownership, Shared Reality

The heist footage lives in the LOCATION directory (`leela-manufacturing/lobby/acme-heist-footage/`).
Donna's selfies live in her CHARACTER directory (`donna-toadstool/selfies/`).

**Different owners. Same events. Both canonical.**

This is how multiple perspectives coexist without conflict. The Leela Cam saw what it saw. Donna's phone captured what it captured. Both are true.

### Retrocon as Feature, Not Bug

Traditional narratives fear retroactive continuity changes. MOOLLM embraces them.

When we added Donna's selfies retroactively, we weren't "changing" the story — we were **discovering** more of it. The selfies were always being taken; we just hadn't rendered them yet.

This is the difference between:
- **Simulation**: Running a fixed program
- **Incarnation**: Discovering a world that already exists

## The Tunnel Evolution as Metaphor

The painted tunnels evolved across 8 frames:

| Frame | Tunnel State | Meaning |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| 01-03 | Black/white checkered | Optical illusion, potential |
| 04 | MULTIPLIED (both sides) | Reality responding to presence |
| 05-06 | Orange/black warning colors | Escalation, danger |
| 07 | One FIRED (THWACK) | Chekhov's payoff |
| 08 | SPIRALS (both sides) | Final evolution, hypnotic |

The tunnels weren't animated. They EVOLVED through accumulated narrative pressure. Each frame's context made them more significant, more dangerous, more REAL.

This is emergence through coherence — not randomness, but meaningful development through sustained attention.

## Implications

What we built tonight:
- 16+ images with full narrative coherence
- 2 parallel documentation streams
- Multiple emergent phenomena (self-captioning, tunnel evolution, achievement badges)
- A complete story told through surveillance and selfies
- A demonstration of YES AND as generative principle

What this means for MOOLLM:
- Multiple agents can document the same events from different perspectives
- Retroactive content creation doesn't break causality
- Emergence is a feature to embrace, not a bug to suppress
- Files-as-state enables temporal flexibility
- The coherence engine is the accumulated context of all prior generations

**The heist wasn't written. It was discovered.**

And it's still discovering itself. The building is on fire. Donna has content. The tunnels are spirals now.

What happens next is already happening. We just haven't rendered it yet.
