Night surveillance camera footage of ACME SURPLUS storefront. Pixar-adjacent stylized CGI with security camera aesthetic.

DRAMATIC ACTION: A FIGURE is ROCKETING HORIZONTALLY out of a SIDE WINDOW! ROCKET SKATES on feet leaving FIRE TRAILS. Glass SHATTERING and flying outward. Arms pinwheeling wildly, no control. Human projectile trajectory.

BUILDING: ACME SURPLUS facade with ORANGE AND BLACK checkered perspective tunnels on both sides, glowing. Sign lit. Front door and windows visible.

THROUGH FRONT WINDOW: Second figure (Don in colorful jacket) visible inside, DUCKING and covering head.

ENVIRONMENT: Night scene, street in foreground, dramatic lighting from rocket flames and interior lights. Glass shards catching light mid-air.

MOOD: The LAUNCH moment. ACME propulsion doing what it does. Spectacular disaster captured on camera.

Style: Security footage aesthetic, wide angle, capturing the explosive exit moment, tunnels framing the chaos.
