# Frame 04: First Contact (Inside ACME)
# "They see what they've gotten into."

# REVELATION: THE STORE IS STOCKED. This isn't abandoned.
# ACME Surplus is OPERATIONAL. The "closed" was a lie.
# The products are here. The traps are maintained. Donna is watching.

  revelations:
    - "ACME Surplus is NOT abandoned — shelves are STOCKED"
    - "This is an ACTIVE facility with maintained security"
    - "The products they're surrounded by are LIVE AMMUNITION"

    They're inside.
    
    The instigator is already walking down an aisle, 
    flashlight (phone?) illuminating shelves of... things.
    
    Don is still near the door, still processing the anvil,
    now seeing the INTERIOR for the first time.
    
    Rows and rows of shelves. Products. ACME PRODUCTS.
    Not dusty relics. CURRENT INVENTORY.
    
    "...I thought you said this place was abandoned."
    
    "It IS abandoned. Look, nobody's here."
    
    From the PA system, a crackle:
    
    "WELCOME TO ACME SURPLUS! 
     May I HELP you find something?
     Perhaps an EXIT? 
     HA! Just kidding. There is no exit.
     Enjoy your SHOPPING EXPERIENCE!"
    
    Don looks at the ceiling. Then at the instigator.
    Then at the door he could still run through.
    
    The door SLAMS SHUT behind him.
    
    *click* — locked.

    CAMERA: We're seeing THROUGH the door/window now
    OR: New camera angle — internal ACME security camera
    
    THE INTERIOR:
    - Rows of industrial shelving stretching into darkness
    - Products visible: boxes, devices, shapes
    - Warm amber lighting (security lights? always on?)
    - The sense of BEING WATCHED
    
    THE INSTIGATOR:
    - Deeper in, walking between shelves
    - Phone flashlight illuminating products
    - Body language: exploring, confident, wrong
    
    DON:
    - Near the entrance, looking around
    - Taking in the scope of the place
    - Body language: increasingly concerned
    - The colorful jacket now seems very VISIBLE in this space
    
    DETAILS TO CAPTURE:
    - Product boxes with ACME branding
    - Aisle numbers (if visible)
    - Shadows that might be something else
    - A PA speaker (Donna's voice comes from somewhere)
    - Maybe: the door closing/locked
    
    THROUGH THE WINDOW (if exterior angle):
    - We see them INSIDE now
    - The tunnel still visible in frame
    - The transition from "approach" to "trapped"
    
  camera_options:
    option_A: |
      Still ACM1 (exterior) — looking THROUGH the window/door
      We see their silhouettes inside, shelves visible
      The tunnel in frame, watching them trapped
      
    option_B: |
      New camera — internal ACME security
      Donna's POV from her monitors
      Industrial angle, product-level, surveillance
      
  donna_status:
    action: "Just activated PA system. Door locked remotely."
    
    commentary: |
      "Welcome, GENTLEMEN! 
       
       Oh don't look so SURPRISED, Fancy Pants.
       You walked into MY building. MY domain.
       
       Did you think nobody was HOME?
       Did you think those products were DORMANT?
       
       EVERYTHING here is LIVE. 
       EVERYTHING here is WATCHING.
       EVERYTHING here WANTS to be USED.
       
       And YOU, my colorful friend, are the CUSTOMER.
       
       The customer is ALWAYS right.
       Right into the TRAP! HA!
       
       Now... which aisle should I tour you through first?
       Projectiles? Propulsion? PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE?
       
       Oh I know! Let's start with the CLASSICS."
       
    next_action: "Checking which levers to pull next"
    
  products_visible:
    aisle_1: "PROJECTILES — Anvils, Pianos, Safes"
    aisle_2: "PROPULSION — Rocket Skates, Jet Packs"
    aisle_3: "PORTABILITY — Holes, Tunnels, Fold-up Cliffs"
    aisle_4: "PERSONAL — Disguises, Bird Costumes"
    return_counter: "Defective items, angry letters"
    
  visual_style: |
    INTERIOR SURVEILLANCE or THROUGH-WINDOW shot.
    
    Either way:
    - Industrial shelving aesthetic
    - Warm amber security lighting
    - Products creating geometry and shadows
    - The figures small against the inventory
    - A sense of being TRAPPED and WATCHED
    
  narrative_moment:
    just_before: "The anvil swung. Don saw it. They entered anyway."
    right_now: "The scale of the mistake becomes clear."
    just_after: "Donna begins the tour. The real traps activate."
    always: "You don't break into ACME. ACME breaks YOU."
    
  chekhov_status:
    tunnel: "Still visible through window. Still waiting."
    anvil: "Fired (Frame 03). More available."
    products: "ALL OF THEM are Chekhov's Guns now."

# CONTEXT FOR FRAME 05
context_for_frame_05:
  situation:
    - "They're locked inside"
    - "Store is STOCKED with live ACME products"
    - "Donna has revealed herself via PA"
    - "The instigator is exploring deeper"
    - "Don is near the exit (now locked)"
    
  next_beat: |
    DEEPER TROUBLE — Something activates.
    
    The instigator touches something. Or trips something.
    Or Donna pulls a lever.
    
    The PROPULSION aisle seems tempting to demonstrate...
