    THE BUILDING IS ON FIRE!!!
    
    We asked for "aftermath." The image gave us INFERNO.
    
    This is YES AND at maximum escalation.
    
    The rocket skates. The chaos. Something ignited.
    ACME SURPLUS is now ACME BONFIRE.

# LAYER 1: THE CONFLAGRATION

layer_fire:
  status: "MASSIVE — fully engulfed interior"
  visible_through: "Shattered front windows"
  color: "Orange/yellow inferno"
  
  interpretation: |
    This was not in the prompt.
    This EMERGED.
    
    The accumulated chaos of:
    - Anvils
    - Conveyor belts
    - Rocket skates
    - Wall impacts
    
    ...resulted in FIRE.
    
    The building fought back. And then caught fire.
    
    This is ACME's final statement:
    "If I'm going down, I'm going down SPECTACULAR."

# LAYER 2: THE TUNNEL EVOLUTION

layer_tunnels_finale:
  status: "EVOLVED TO SPIRALS"
  
  progression:
    frames_1_3: "Black and white checkered"
    frames_4_5: "Orange and black checkered"
    frame_6: "Orange and black, framing chaos"
    frame_7: "Orange/blue, one fired (THWACK)"
    frame_8: "SPIRAL PATTERNS — blue and orange swirls"
    
  interpretation: |
    The tunnels have reached their FINAL FORM.
    
    No longer checkered perspective.
    Now HYPNOTIC SPIRALS.
    
    The building is burning.
    The tunnels are ASCENDING.
    
    They've absorbed enough chaos to evolve.
    They're MORE hypnotic than ever.
    
    The fire will not consume them.
    The tunnels are beyond fire now.

# LAYER 3: THE SURVIVORS

layer_survivors:
  count: 3  # More than expected!
  
  figure_1:
    clothing: "TIE-DYE JACKET — Don!"
    pose: "HANDS ON HEAD — classic horror"
    position: "Center foreground"
    
  figure_2:
    clothing: "Also tie-dye?"
    pose: "Looking at fire"
    position: "Left foreground"
    
  figure_3:
    clothing: "Dark hoodie — the instigator"
    pose: "Standing, watching"
    position: "Right foreground"
    
  emergence: |
    THREE survivors?
    
    We had TWO intruders.
    Now there are THREE figures.
    
    Either:
    - Someone else was in there
    - The instigator split somehow
    - A witness joined them
    - ACME physics created a duplicate
    
    The heist outputs more than its inputs.

# LAYER 4: THE DAMAGE

layer_damage:
  windows:
    ground_floor: "SHATTERED — front completely open"
    upper_floor: "ALSO BROKEN — fire spreading up"
    
  debris: "Glass and materials on sidewalk"
  interior: "Visible through flames — shelving, products, chaos"
  sign: "ACME SURPLUS still visible — red background now"
  
  interpretation: |
    The building sustained:
    - Rocket exit damage
    - Tunnel impact
    - General ACME chaos
    - And now: FIRE
    
    The insurance claim for this night will be LEGENDARY.

# LAYER 5: DONNA'S FINAL REACTION

layer_donna:
  reaction: |
    "...
     
     ...
     
     Huh.
     
     Well.
     
     The building is on fire.
     
     That's... new.
     
     I should probably... evacuate?
     
     ...
     
     But FIRST let me take one more selfie.
     This is PREMIUM CONTENT."
