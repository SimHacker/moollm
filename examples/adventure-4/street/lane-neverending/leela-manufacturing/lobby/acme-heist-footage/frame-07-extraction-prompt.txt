Night surveillance camera footage of ACME SURPLUS storefront. Pixar-adjacent stylized CGI with security camera aesthetic.

CRITICAL ACTION — TUNNEL IMPACT: A figure in COLORFUL TIE-DYE JACKET has just RUN INTO the painted tunnel on the wall and is BOUNCING OFF! Classic cartoon THWACK moment — body flattened against the wall, arms and legs splayed, impact stars/lines around him.

THE PAINTED TUNNEL: Orange and black checkered perspective tunnel painted on the building wall. It looks like an exit but it's SOLID WALL. The figure tried to run through it.

BUILDING: ACME SURPLUS sign lit, both painted tunnels visible (one on each side), windows showing interior.

POSE: Classic Wile E. Coyote wall-impact — body compressed against painted tunnel, realization dawning, arms splayed.

MOOD: The moment of truth. The tunnel was never real. CHEKHOV'S TUNNEL has been fired.

Style: Security footage aesthetic, wide angle, capturing the brutal comedy of painted tunnel collision.
