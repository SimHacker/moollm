Security camera footage looking THROUGH storefront window/door into the interior of ACME SURPLUS. Night scene, timestamp visible. We now see the figures INSIDE the store.

THE VIEW: Looking through the glass door/window from outside. The black-and-white PAINTED TUNNEL still visible on the facade to the right. The figures are now INSIDE, surrounded by merchandise.

THE INTERIOR (visible through glass):
- Industrial shelving rows stretching deep into the store
- STOCKED SHELVES — products, boxes, ACME merchandise everywhere
- Warm amber security lighting casting long shadows
- NOT abandoned — this is an ACTIVE inventory

FIGURE 1 (instigator): Deeper inside, walking between shelves, phone flashlight illuminating products. Exploring confidently. Back to camera.

FIGURE 2 (Don, colorful psychedelic jacket): Near the entrance, still close to the door. Looking around at the scope of the place. Expression: dawning realization that this was a mistake. His colorful pattern stands out against the industrial interior.

THE DOOR: Now CLOSED between camera and the figures. The "CLOSED" sign facing us. They are TRAPPED inside.

THE PAINTED TUNNEL: Still visible on the right side of frame — Chekhov's Tunnel watching, waiting, reminding us it's there.

DETAILS: Product boxes with ACME branding visible on shelves. Shadows between aisles. A sense of maze-like depth. The figures small against the inventory. Something watching from the darkness.

LIGHTING: Exterior streetlamp amber reflecting on glass. Interior security lights creating pools and shadows. The warm glow of an active facility.

MOOD: TRAPPED. The realization. They're inside now and the door is closed. Surrounded by products that want to be used. Watched by something. The tunnel waits.

STYLE: Surveillance aesthetic with through-glass voyeurism. Pixar-adjacent CGI. The frame between freedom and captivity.
