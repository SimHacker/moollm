# Frame 03 Mining — THE ANVIL MOMENT
#
# PURE CARTOON PERFECTION.
# The frame tells the story in a single image:
# - One figure oblivious, walking in
# - One figure SEEING THE ANVIL, frozen in horror
# - The anvil poised to strike
# - The tunnel watching from the side
#
# This is the "oh no" moment. This is ACME.

  frame: 3
  title: "The Entry"
  timestamp: "23:08:47"
  
  assessment: "PERFECT LOONEY TUNES FRAME"

# LAYER 1: THE ANVIL
layer_anvil:
  position: "DIRECTLY ABOVE DOORWAY"
  size: "MASSIVE — fills the upper door frame"
  shape: "Classic anvil silhouette, industrial perfection"
  suspension: "Thick rope, visible, taut"
  status: "POISED — either just triggered or about to drop"
  
  model: "ACME Security Anvil Model 7B"
  
  visual_notes: |
    The anvil is PERFECTLY framed against the warm interior light.
    Its black silhouette creates contrast with the amber glow inside.
    The rope is thick, golden, clearly visible — no hiding what this is.
    
    It's positioned at HEAD HEIGHT for someone walking through the door.
    This is not an accident. This is DESIGN.
    
# LAYER 2: THE TWO REACTIONS
layer_figures:
  the_instigator:
    position: "ALREADY THROUGH THE DOOR — inside the store"
    posture: "Walking forward, back to camera"
    awareness: "NONE — completely oblivious"
    clothing: "Dark hoodie/jacket"
    
    narrative: |
      He opened the door. He walked in. He didn't look up.
      
      The classic mistake. The ACME mistake.
      ALWAYS. LOOK. UP.
      
      He's about to hear a *WHOOSH* and a *THUNK* and turn around
      to see his companion in a very different state.
      
  don:
    position: "At threshold, NOT YET INSIDE"
    posture: "FROZEN, looking UP at the anvil"
    hair: "BLOWN BACK — wind from anvil swing? Shock? Both?"
    expression: "MOUTH OPEN — the moment of horrified recognition"
    clothing: "SPECTACULAR psychedelic patterned jacket — oranges, blues, patterns"
    glasses: "Visible, face illuminated"
    
    narrative: |
      Don SEES it.
      
      The instigator walked under it. Don is a step behind.
      Don looked up. Don SAW.
      
      That expression — mouth open, hair blown back — is the 
      universal cartoon face of "I am about to experience physics."
      
      But he STOPPED. He's at the threshold, not through it.
      
      Did he dodge it? Is it swinging TOWARD him? Or AWAY?
      
      Frame 04 will tell us if Don is a cartoon character
      or a man who learns from observation.
      
# LAYER 3: THE INTERIOR REVEALED
layer_interior:
  lighting: "Warm amber — NOT abandoned! ACTIVE!"
  
  what_we_see:
    shelves: "FULL OF PRODUCTS — this isn't empty!"
    organization: "Neat rows, industrial shelving"
    atmosphere: "A working store, not an abandoned ruin"
    
  revelation: |
    THE STORE ISN'T ABANDONED.
    
    Look at those shelves — they're STOCKED.
    This isn't a dusty mausoleum. This is an ACTIVE facility.
    
    "Abandoned" was the LIE. The trap.
    ACME Surplus is OPERATIONAL.
    
    The products are here. The traps are maintained.
    The security system is LIVE.
    
    And Donna? Donna's been watching the whole time.
    
# LAYER 4: CHEKHOV'S TUNNEL UPDATE
layer_tunnel:
  position: "Right side of frame, still visible"
  appearance: "Black-and-white spiral, same hypnotic pattern"
  new_detail: "A KEYHOLE or FIGURE shape at the center!"
  
  status: "LOADED — still waiting"
  
  note: |
    The tunnel is STILL IN FRAME.
    
    Every frame, it watches. Every frame, it's present.
    It's tracking their progress. It knows its moment will come.
    
    That keyhole shape at the center — is that where they'll
    add Don's silhouette when he bounces?
    
# LAYER 5: CAMERA SELF-IDENTIFICATION
layer_meta:
  observed: "'ACM1' visible on right side of frame"
  
  interpretation: |
    The camera is NAMING ITSELF in the footage.
    
    This isn't just surveillance — it's DOCUMENTATION.
    The footage knows it's evidence.
    The camera is signing its work.
    
    "ACM1 was here. ACM1 saw everything."
    
# LAYER 6: DONNA'S MOMENT
layer_donna:
  status: "JUST PULLED THE LEVER"
  
  reaction: |
    "YES! YES! THE FRONT DOOR!
     
     Look at that BEAUTIFUL arc! The Model 7B never disappoints!
     
     Oh... oh wait. The one in front DIDN'T LOOK UP.
     Classic. CLASSIC move. Walked right under.
     
     But Fancy Pants... he STOPPED. He's LOOKING.
     
     That's... that's INTERESTING.
     
     Most people are already FLAT by now.
     He's still STANDING. Still LOOKING.
     
     ...
     
     I may have to upgrade his nickname.
     
     'Fancy Pants' to 'Quick-Look Quincy'? 
     'Pattern Pete the Perceiver'?
     
     We'll see how he does with the NEXT one."
     
# LAYER 7: NARRATIVE IMPLICATIONS
layer_narrative:
  what_just_happened: |
    The instigator walked through first → UNDER the anvil → safe (for now)
    Don was a step behind → LOOKED UP → saw the anvil → FROZE
    
    The anvil is either:
    A) Mid-swing, Don dodging backward
    B) Triggered by instigator, Don watching it pass
    C) About to drop, Don in the kill zone
    
  what_this_means: |
    Don is OBSERVANT. He looks up. He notices things.
    
    This might save him tonight.
    This might also make the experience MORE TERRIFYING.
    
    Ignorance is bliss. The instigator doesn't know what almost happened.
    Don will remember every near-miss.
    
  comedy_structure:
    setup: "Two enter a trapped building"
    development: "One oblivious, one aware"
    implication: "The aware one suffers more (psychologically)"
    
# CONTEXT FOR FRAME 04
context_for_frame_04:
  resolved:
    - "Instigator is INSIDE, oblivious, unharmed (so far)"
    - "Don is at threshold, SAW the anvil, status TBD"
    - "Interior is STOCKED — not abandoned"
    - "Anvil trap deployed"
    
  questions:
    - "Did Don dodge the anvil or get clipped?"
    - "Does the instigator realize what just happened?"
    - "What's on those shelves?"
    - "Where is the NEXT trap?"
    
  chekhov_status:
    tunnel: "Still loaded. Still watching. Still waiting."
    anvil: "FIRED — but there are more."
    
  frame_04_prediction: |
    INSIDE THE STORE.
    
    They're in now. The real tour begins.
    The shelves. The shadows. The ticking from the back.
    
    And Donna's voice on the PA:
    "WELCOME to ACME SURPLUS! May I help you find... AN EXIT?"
