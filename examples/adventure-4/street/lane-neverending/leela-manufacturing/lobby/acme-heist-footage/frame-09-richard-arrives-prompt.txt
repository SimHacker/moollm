Night surveillance camera footage. Pixar-adjacent stylized CGI with security camera aesthetic.

SCENE: ACME SURPLUS building ON FIRE in background, spiral painted tunnels (blue and orange) glowing on either side. Flames visible through windows.

THREE FIGURES in foreground/middle ground:

FIGURE 1 (RIGHT): Distinguished older gentleman with white beard and glasses, wearing cardigan, approaching the scene with ACADEMIC CURIOSITY. Scholarly posture, hands possibly clasped behind back or adjusting glasses. The "investigating professor" stance.

FIGURE 2 (CENTER): Man in torn TIE-DYE JACKET crouching LOW, exhibiting RABBIT BEHAVIOR — nose twitching, ears alert (human ears but PERKED), hands tucked up like paws, wide frightened eyes. Transforming into rabbit posture.

FIGURE 3 (LEFT): Third figure (the instigator) possibly hiding or backing away.

LIGHTING: Fire glow from burning building, night scene, dramatic orange light on faces.

MOOD: The academic meets the absurd. The rabbit emerges. Cartoon physics awaits its next victim.

Style: Surveillance footage, wide shot, the moment before catastrophe.
