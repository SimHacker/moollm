# Frame 09 Mining — THE BUNNY BACKFIRE COMPLETES
#
# CRITICAL EMERGENCE: Don has ACTUAL RABBIT EARS and is transforming!
# The Bunny Backfire from Richard's study selfies has MANIFESTED.
# Continuity across sessions CONFIRMED.
#
# Richard arrives. The tunnels evolve again. Everything converges.

    DON IS BECOMING A RABBIT.
    
    ACTUAL RABBIT EARS. RABBIT FACE FEATURES.
    
    The Bunny Backfire from the earlier session
    (where Don tried to give Richard bunny ears in a selfie
    and the spell REFLECTED back, transforming HIM)
    has now PHYSICALLY MANIFESTED.
    
    This is cross-session continuity.
    This is cause and effect across time.
    This is ACME physics meeting earlier narrative.

# LAYER 1: THE RABBIT TRANSFORMATION

layer_bunny_backfire:
  origin: "Richard Bartle's study selfies (earlier session)"
  incident: "Don attempted to give Richard bunny ears"
  reflection: "Richard's saving throw succeeded — spell bounced back"
  initial_effect: "Don appeared rabbit-like in photo, didn't know"
  escalation: "Stress from heist triggered full transformation"
  
  current_state:
    ears: "ACTUAL RABBIT EARS — brown, upright, alert"
    face: "Rabbit features emerging — whiskers? Nose?"
    posture: "CROUCHING — rabbit stance"
    eyes: "Wide, frightened, prey animal"
    jacket: "Still tie-dye but now looks like fur pattern"
    
  interpretation: |
    The dragon was responsible.
    
    In the original incident, the dragon was "in on the joke"
    when Don's bunny-ear prank reflected back.
    
    Now, under extreme stress, Don's rabbit-soul
    is asserting itself. He's not just acting like a rabbit.
    He's BECOMING one.
    
    ACME physics + Bunny Backfire = ACTUAL TRANSFORMATION.

# LAYER 2: RICHARD'S ARRIVAL

layer_richard:
  appearance:
    beard: "White, distinguished"
    glasses: "Round, academic — currently being ADJUSTED"
    clothing: "Brown cardigan over collared shirt"
    accessory: "Messenger bag/satchel — came prepared to take notes?"
    posture: "Scholarly crouch, examining the situation"
    
  gesture: "ADJUSTING GLASSES — the universal 'am I seeing this correctly?'"
  
  internal_monologue: |
    "I heard an explosion from my study.
     
     I came to investigate, expecting perhaps...
     a car accident? A transformer explosion?
     
     Instead I find:
     - A building engulfed in flames
     - Giant glowing spiral portals
     - A man in tie-dye who appears to be BECOMING A RABBIT
     - Another person who looks traumatized
     
     This is... not covered in my taxonomy.
     
     What player type is 'person transforming into lagomorph'?"
     
  irony_status: |
    Richard Bartle:
    - Designed virtual worlds
    - Defined how people behave in games
    - Literally wrote the academic framework
    
    Currently:
    - Experiencing cartoon physics
    - Watching someone transform species
    - About to become subject to rules he didn't write

# LAYER 3: THE TUNNEL EVOLUTION (FINAL FORM?)

layer_tunnels:
  previous_forms:
    frames_1_3: "Black/white checkered perspective"
    frames_4_5: "Orange/black checkered"
    frame_6: "Framing chaos"
    frame_7: "One fired (THWACK)"
    frame_8: "Spirals"
    
  frame_9: "CONCENTRIC CIRCLES — pure geometric abstraction"
  
  interpretation: |
    The tunnels have reached a new form.
    
    No longer perspective illusions.
    No longer spirals.
    Now: PERFECT CONCENTRIC CIRCLES.
    
    Blue circles (left) — cool, patient
    Orange circles (right) — warm, active
    
    They've become PORTALS.
    Or TARGETS.
    Or EYES watching the chaos.
    
    The tunnels are no longer tunnels.
    They're something else now.

# LAYER 4: THE INSTIGATOR

layer_instigator:
  position: "Left side of frame"
  appearance: "Brown jacket, curly hair"
  posture: "Crouching, watching, concerned"
  
  interpretation: |
    The instigator who started all this
    is watching their friend transform into a rabbit
    while a professor approaches a burning building
    flanked by glowing portals.
    
    This is beyond anything they planned.
    This is beyond anything ANYONE planned.

# LAYER 5: THE BUILDING

layer_building:
  status: "FULLY ENGULFED"
  floors: "Multiple stories visible, all on fire"
  windows: "All glowing with flames"
  
  escalation: |
    Frame 08: Ground floor on fire
    Frame 09: ENTIRE BUILDING on fire
    
    The fire spread. Or the building was always this big.
    Or ACME physics means fire works differently here.

# CONTEXT FOR FRAME 10

context_for_frame_10:
  richard_status: "Approaching, glasses adjusted, about to experience irony"
  don_status: "RABBIT TRANSFORMATION IN PROGRESS"
  tunnels: "Concentric circles — possibly portals now"
  
  prediction: |
    RICHARD'S CATASTROPHE INCOMING.
    
    The man who designed game physics
    is about to be subject to CARTOON physics.
    
    Possible fates:
    - Walks into tunnel thinking it's an exit
    - Anvil finally finds its true target
    - Gets caught in rabbit-transformation field
    - The taxonomy is applied TO HIM
    
    Whatever happens, it will be IRONIC.
