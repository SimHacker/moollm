    what_we_see: |
      CHEKHOV'S TUNNEL PAYOFF:
      
      Don, in his colorful jacket, running toward what he thinks
      is an EXIT (the tunnel on the right side).
      
      The tunnel is PAINTED ON THE WALL.
      It is NOT an exit.
      
      IMPACT MOMENT:
      - Don hitting the wall
      - Or bouncing off
      - Or discovering reality too late
      - Arms up, legs out, classic THWACK pose
      
      The tunnel was never real.
      The tunnel was always a TRAP.
      Just not the kind of trap we expected.

      Donna, watching:
      
      "OH NO. Oh NO NO NO.
       He's going for the TUNNEL!
       
       THAT'S NOT A DOOR, FANCY PANTS!
       THAT'S A PAINTING!
       
       ...
       
       Well. He'll find out."

  narrative_beat: |
    CHEKHOV'S TUNNEL: FIRED.
    
    All story long, the tunnel waited.
    Hypnotic. Beckoning. Promising escape.
    
    It was paint.
    It was always paint.
    
    Now someone has discovered this.
    With their face.
