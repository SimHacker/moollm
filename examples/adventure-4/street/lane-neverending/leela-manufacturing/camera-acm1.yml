# Camera ACM1 — The Tunnel Watcher
# Leela's camera trained on the ACME painted tunnel across the street
#
# This is not surveillance. This is STUDY.
# Every day, we look at what failure looks like.
# Every day, we recommit to being the opposite.

  description: |
    A Leela camera mounted in the lobby window, pointed across the street
    at the shuttered ACME Surplus building. Wide-angle lens captures:
    
    1. THE PAINTED TUNNEL — on the boarded-up side window
    2. THE FRONT WINDOW — large, unboarded, view into showroom/warehouse
    3. THE ENTRANCE — locked door, break-in attempts visible
    
    The feed runs on a small monitor at reception. Every visitor sees it.
    Every employee passes it. Every day, the reminder:
    
    "This is what happens when you ship products that don't work."
    
  coverage: |
    ACM1 can't see everything inside ACME, but the large front window
    provides visibility into the main showroom area. Detectable events:
    
    - BREAK-INS: Glass breaking, door forced, figures entering
    - SMOKE: Visible through window (frequent, given ACME product quality)
    - BEE SWARMS: Escaped from ACME Bee Cannon products (monthly)
    - ANVIL DROPS: Distinctive dust clouds, screaming
    - EXPLOSIONS: Flash, smoke, cartoon physics aftermath
    - ESCAPE ATTEMPTS: Intruders fleeing, often on fire
    
    The tunnel is on a boarded window — can only see approach/bounce.
    The front window is unboarded — partial interior visibility.
    
  purpose: |
    ACM1 serves multiple purposes:
    
    1. ANOMALY DETECTION
       The tunnel is "magic" — delivery drivers pass through it, customers
       cannot. ACM1 detects this anomaly and logs it:
       
       "Entity: delivery_truck. Action: approached_tunnel. Result: PASSED_THROUGH."
       "Entity: pedestrian. Action: approached_tunnel. Result: BOUNCED."
       "Entity: tesla_fsd. Action: approached_tunnel. Result: COLLISION. (Again.)"
       
    2. PATTERN RECOGNITION
       Over time, ACM1 has learned:
       - Who can pass through (ACME employees, delivery drivers, cartoon physics)
       - Who cannot (customers, Teslas, anyone with expectations)
       - When attempts peak (Tuesdays, new moon, after viral tweets)
       
    3. DAILY REMINDER
       Every Leela employee sees the tunnel every day.
       Every meeting starts with "What's the ACME tunnel trying to teach us?"
       
       Answers vary:
       - "Don't paint solutions. Build them."
       - "Magic only works for some people. Real engineering works for everyone."
       - "If your product requires cartoon physics, maybe rethink the product."

  the_lesson: |
    The ACME tunnel is a perfect metaphor:
    
    - It LOOKS like a solution
    - It WORKS for some people (the insiders)
    - It FAILS for customers (the people you're supposed to serve)
    - It DECEIVES (and Teslas believe the deception)
    
    Leela's job is to build solutions that work for EVERYONE.
    Not painted tunnels that only work for delivery drivers.
    
    ACM1 reminds us of this. Every day. Every frame.
    
  quotes:
    don_hopkins: |
      "ACME's tunnel is the perfect anti-pattern. It's a solution that works
      exactly as well as the customer can't see it working. Leela is the opposite:
      we make the invisible visible. We don't paint solutions. We BUILD them."
      
    the_coordinator: |
      "We got three orders for 'ACME-compatible Tesla repair kits' after
      the last FSD incident. We don't sell those. But we did add a new
      training dataset: 'painted_tunnel_detection.'"

       The lesson will remain. Shortcuts don't work. Ever.")

        *The camera pans slightly toward the ACME tunnel*
        
        That's the tunnel. Painted in 1952. Still fools Teslas.
        
        Watch... wait for it... there. See that ACME delivery truck?
        It just drove straight through. Like the wall isn't there.
        
        Now watch this tourist... and... bounce. The wall is very there.
        
        That's the difference between solutions that work for insiders
        and solutions that work for everyone. ACME built for insiders.
        Leela builds for everyone.

        ACME Surplus. Our neighbors across the street. Our anti-pattern.
        
        They sold products that didn't work and blamed the customer.
        We sell understanding that works and empowers the customer.
        
        They left a painted tunnel and 27 Tesla crashes.
        We've had 847 days since our last paradox incident.
        
        The tunnel is a daily reminder. We look at it every morning.
        We will never be that.
