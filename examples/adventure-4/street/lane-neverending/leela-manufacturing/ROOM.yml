# The cameras watching this facility are the same cameras we deploy.
# The prototype warehouse ships SKILLS, not anvils.
# The loading docks receive PROBLEMS and ship SOLUTIONS.
#
# Where ACME ships broken products and blames customers,

  # THE CAMERAS ARE WATCHING (helpfully!)
  camera_philosophy: |
    Every camera in this facility is a LEELA camera.
    Neural-symbolic vision. Causal reasoning. Edge computing.
    
    What you see here is what we DEPLOY:
    - Object detection (who's where, what's moving)
    - Pose estimation (ergonomics, safety, efficiency)
    - Activity tracking (what's happening, when, where)
    - Anomaly detection (before problems become disasters)
    - Context inference (understanding WHY, not just WHAT)
    
    The cameras don't judge. They help you SEE.
    And seeing clearly is the first step to understanding.

    You enter LEELA MANUFACTURING INTELLIGENCE through the main doors.
    
    Unlike the shuttered ACME Surplus across the street, this place THRIVES.
    Warm, welcoming, unexpectedly alive for an industrial building —
    polished concrete, exposed brick, plants that seem to WATCH you.
    (They're not watching. But the cameras are. Helpfully.)
    
    Above reception, a wall-sized display cycles through live feeds:
    factory floors, loading docks, conveyor belts — all annotated with
    glowing overlays that label, track, and predict. You realize:
    THIS is what Leela sells. Not the factory. The SEEING.
    
    A brass plaque explains:
    
        LEELA MANUFACTURING INTELLIGENCE
        ================================

        "We don't make products. We make INSIGHTS."
        
        This facility is a DEMONSTRATION.
        Every camera here runs Leela vision.
        Every conveyor is monitored for anomalies.
        Every worker is protected by predictive safety.
        
        What you see here is what YOUR factory could see.
        
        FLOOR DIRECTORY:
        ----------------
        Floor 1 .... Intake (problems arrive)
        Floor 2 .... Factory (where seeing happens)
        Floor 3 .... Shipping (solutions depart)
        Basement ... R&D (the Schema Mechanism)
        Rooftop .... Garden (turtles, eventually)
        
        Unlike ACME, we actually USE our own products.
        847 days since last paradox incident.
    
    A scale model of the facility sits under glass in the center.
    Tiny cameras blink. Tiny overlays annotate tiny workers.
    It's a demo of the demo. Recursive, like everything here.

    THE LOBBY — Where Seeing Begins
    
    Reception Desk:
    Staffed by a friendly agent named "Welcome." (Yes, that's their name.)
    Above them, a live feed with Leela annotations:
    "VISITOR detected. Probability: FRIENDLY. Offering: mints."
    
    The View Across the Street:
    Through the front windows, you see ACME Surplus. Shuttered.
    Boarded up. And there it is — THE PAINTED TUNNEL.
    A camera (CAM-ACM1) is pointed directly at it, 24/7.
    A small monitor shows the feed: "TUNNEL WATCHER — Live"
    
    As you watch, a delivery truck approaches the painted wall...
    and drives straight through. Like the wall isn't there.
    A tourist approaches next... and bounces off. The wall is VERY there.
    
    "That's the difference," says Welcome. "Solutions that work for
    insiders vs solutions that work for everyone."
    
    The Wall of Cameras:
    A dozen live feeds from customer sites (anonymized).
    Each shows Leela vision in action:
    • Factory floor with worker pose estimation
    • Loading dock with package tracking
    • Conveyor belt with anomaly detection highlights
    • Forklift zone with pedestrian safety alerts
    • ACME tunnel (anomaly detection, pattern recognition)
    
    The Scale Model:
    Under glass, a perfect miniature of this facility.
    But look closer — tiny CAMERAS on every surface.
    Tiny overlays track tiny forklifts.
    It's not just a model. It's a PROOF.
    
    The Philosophy Wall:
    Unlike ACME (across the street, shuttered, painted tunnel still visible from our windows),
    Leela believes in:
    • Reliability over cleverness
    • Understanding over impressing
    • Helping customers see their OWN factories
    • Making intelligence emerge from observation
    
    "ACME sold products that broke.
     Leela sells SIGHT that works."
    
  # What Leela actually does (not the fantasy)
  reality_layer: |
    WHAT THIS FACILITY REPRESENTS:
    
    In REALITY, Leela deploys vision systems to CUSTOMER factories.
    The factory floors, logistics, shipping — those are the CUSTOMER'S.
    Leela provides the CAMERAS, the MODELS, the INSIGHT.
    
    This fantasy facility is a poetic representation:
    - Floor 1 (Intake) = Customer problems arriving
    - Floor 2 (Factory) = Where Leela vision processes data
    - Floor 3 (Shipping) = Solutions and insights delivered
    - Basement (R&D) = Schema mechanism, causal learning
    - Storage = Prototype skills ready to deploy
    
    Every camera in this building runs Leela software.
    Every annotation you see is REAL Leela output.
    The factory is a living demo of the product.

philosophy: |
    THE LEELA WAY (The Anti-ACME)
    =============================
    
    ACME sold products that didn't work and blamed the customer.
    Leela helps customers see their OWN factories more clearly.
    
    ACME promised "it'll work this time!" (It never did.)
    Leela promises "we'll help you understand what's happening."
    
    ACME was a solution looking for problems.
    Leela is understanding looking for applications.
    
    We don't believe intelligence is a product.
    We believe it's a PROCESS.
    
    We manufacture the CONDITIONS for intelligence to emerge:
    - The right cameras watching the right things
    - The right models asking the right questions
    - The right interfaces for humans to understand
    - The right respect for customer data sovereignty
    
    And then we get out of the way.
    
    "Manufacturing Intelligence" means:
    1. AI for manufacturing (industrial applications)
    2. Building intelligence (constructionism)
    3. Society of Mind (agents working together)
    4. Seeing clearly (neural-symbolic vision)
    5. Understanding why (causal reasoning)
    6. Helping, not replacing (human agency)

    WHAT LEELA DOES (for visitors who ask)
    ======================================
    
    Q: What does Leela actually make?
    A: We make factories SMARTER — without replacing the humans.
    
    Q: How?
    A: Cameras + AI. We watch. We understand. We predict.
       - "That forklift is about to hit that pedestrian" (before it happens)
       - "That machine is wearing out" (before it breaks)
       - "That worker is overextending" (before they get hurt)
       - "That process is bottlenecking" (before production stops)
    
    Q: Isn't that creepy?
    A: Only if you do it wrong. We believe in:
       - Transparency (workers know what's being watched)
       - Privacy (faces blur, data stays on-premise)
       - Human agency (AI advises, humans decide)
       - Customer sovereignty (your data, your factory, your control)
    
    Q: How is this different from ACME?
    A: *gestures out the window at painted tunnel across the street*
       ACME sold PRODUCTS that didn't work.
       Leela sells UNDERSTANDING that does.
       
       ACME promised magic. Delivered catastrophe.
       Leela promises insight. Delivers clarity.
       
       Also, we've never caused a single Tesla to drive into a wall.
