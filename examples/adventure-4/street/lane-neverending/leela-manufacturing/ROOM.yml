    You enter LEELA MANUFACTURING INTELLIGENCE through the main doors.
    The lobby is unexpectedly warm and welcoming for an industrial building —
    polished concrete floors, exposed brick, and a reception desk staffed
    by someone who seems genuinely happy to see you.
    
    A large sign dominates the wall behind reception:

  philosophy: |
    We don't believe intelligence is a product.
    We believe it's a PROCESS.
    
    We manufacture the CONDITIONS for intelligence to emerge:
    - The right questions
    - The right environment  
    - The right collaborators
    - The right amount of coffee
    
    And then we get out of the way.
