    SORTING STATIONS
    ════════════════
    
    Each station is a small booth with:
    • Conveyor access (items arrive automatically)
    • Classification terminal
    • Routing controls
    • Very large coffee mug
    
    THE SORTING PROCESS:
    1. "Is this actually a question?" (You'd be surprised how often: no)
    2. "What category?" (Manufacturing, logistics, process, meta, other, ???)
    3. "Priority level?" (Urgent, normal, whenever, never, "dear god why")
    4. "Route to which processing line?"
    
    STATION SPECIALTIES:
    • Stations 1-3: Questions (high volume)
    • Stations 4-5: Problems (requires experience)
    • Station 6: Data validation
    • Station 7: Edge cases (the weird stuff)
    • Station 8: The Confused Welcome Desk
    
    THE CONFUSED WELCOME DESK (Station 8):
    For items that defy categorization. The worker here has seen
    everything. Nothing surprises them anymore. Their coffee mug
    says: "I'VE SEEN WEIRDER."
