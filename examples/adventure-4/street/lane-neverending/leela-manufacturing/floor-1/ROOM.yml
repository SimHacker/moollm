# FLOOR 1 — INTAKE DEPARTMENT
# Where problems arrive and get sorted

room:
  name: Leela Floor 1 — Intake Department
  type: factory_floor
  
  description: |
    The INTAKE DEPARTMENT occupies the entire first floor. Conveyor belts
    crisscross the space, carrying containers of various sizes — each one
    holding a problem, question, or batch of raw data waiting to be processed.
    
    Workers in blue jumpsuits sort incoming shipments with practiced efficiency.
    Some containers glow faintly. Others rattle. One seems to be asking questions
    about itself.
    
    A massive board on the wall shows today's intake volume:
    
    ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐

    INTAKE DEPARTMENT — FLOOR 1
    
    THE SORTING LINES:
    Three main conveyor lines run the length of the floor:
    • Line A: Questions (blue containers)
    • Line B: Problems (yellow containers)
    • Line C: Raw Data (green containers)
    
    THE SORTING STATIONS:
    Workers evaluate each incoming item:
    1. "Is this actually a question?" (You'd be surprised)
    2. "What category?" (Manufacturing, logistics, process, meta, other)
    3. "Priority level?" (Urgent, normal, whenever, never)
    4. "Route to which processing line?"
    
    THE CONFUSED WELCOME DESK:
    For items that don't fit any category. A patient worker sits here
    with a large cup of coffee and an expression of infinite tolerance.
    Sign: "IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS IS, NEITHER DO WE. YET."
    
    THE QUARANTINE ZONE:
    A glassed-off area in the corner for dangerous items.
    Currently contains: 1 paradox (pacing back and forth),
    2 recursive questions (asking each other), and something
    that arrived labeled "DO NOT THINK ABOUT."
    
  workers:
    - "Intake Specialists (blue jumpsuits)"
    - "Categorizers (clipboards, thoughtful expressions)"
    - "The Confused Welcome Desk attendant"
    - "Quarantine Officer (hazmat suit, nervous)"
