    CURRENT VIEW:
    • Conveyor Line V: Purple containers flowing (video)
    • Junction Alpha: Fork active, splitting streams
    • Line O: Blue containers (objects detected)
    • Line P: Orange containers (poses estimated)
    • Sorting Stations: Workers directing traffic
    • Intake Board: Numbers updating in real-time
    
    DETECTED IN LAST HOUR:
    • 1847 object detections (mostly containers)
    • 423 pose estimations (workers)
    • 89 "CONTAINER_PASSED" events
    • 47 "JUNCTION_FORK" events
    • 12 "SORTING_ACTION" events
    • 3 "CONFUSED_CONTAINER" events (rerouted)
    
    SELF-REFERENCE LEVEL: HIGH
    INT1 watches the intake floor.
    INT1's feed enters the intake floor.
    INT1's feed is processed, detecting INT1's feed entering.
    The containers carrying insights about containers
    become containers carrying insights about insights
    about containers.
    
    This is normal. (Probably.)

        Containers flow endlessly below.
        Purple splits to blue and orange.
        Blue and orange merge to gold.
        Gold flows onward.
        
        In one of those containers: the insight
        generated from watching this very flow.
        
        It's turtles all the way down.
        (Eventually would approve.)
