    Seven main conveyor lines crisscross the floor, carrying
    containers from the loading docks to sorting stations.
    Each line handles a different type of input.

    INTAKE CONVEYOR SYSTEM
    ══════════════════════
    
    Seven parallel lines, color-coded:
    
    LINE A (Blue): Questions
    ════════════════════════
    Blue containers glide past, each holding one or more questions.
    Some containers vibrate with curiosity.
    Destination: Question Processing (Floor 2, Cells A-C)
    
    LINE B (Yellow): Problems  
    ═════════════════════════
    Yellow containers, heavier-looking. Problems have weight.
    Some containers seem reluctant to move.
    Destination: Problem Furnace (Floor 2)
    
    LINE C (Green): Raw Data
    ════════════════════════
    Green containers, often larger. Data comes in bulk.
    Humming sounds — data is restless.
    Destination: Data Processing (Floor 2, Cell D)
    
    LINE D (Purple): Video → Objects
    ════════════════════════════════
    Purple containers with blinking lights. Video streams inside.
    Each frame analyzed, objects extracted, catalogued.
    Destination: Vision Processing (Floor 2, Cell F)
    Output: Detected objects, scene graphs, temporal patterns
    
    LINE E (Orange): Poses → Insights
    ═════════════════════════════════
    Orange containers with motion sensors. Human poses captured.
    Skeletal data flows through, gestures recognized.
    Destination: Motion Analysis (Floor 2, Cell G)
    Output: Movement insights, behavioral patterns, dance moves
    
    LINE F (Cyan): SQL → Queries
    ════════════════════════════
    Cyan containers humming with structured data.
    Queries arrive malformed, leave optimized.
    Destination: Query Optimization (Floor 2, Cell D-2)
    Output: Execution plans, indices, pipeline configurations
    
    LINE G (Silver): Pipelines
    ══════════════════════════
    Silver containers linking other containers together.
    Data flows defined, orchestrated, monitored.
    Destination: Pipeline Assembly (Floor 2, Cell E)
    Output: ETL workflows, streaming pipelines, DAGs
    
    SPECIAL ROUTING:
    • Red containers: QUARANTINE (automatic divert)
    • Purple containers: "Weird Ones" (manual inspection)
    • Unmarked containers: Confused Welcome Desk
    • Containers that move themselves: Zone 7
