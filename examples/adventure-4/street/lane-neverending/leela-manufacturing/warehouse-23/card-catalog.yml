    A wooden card catalog stretching up beyond sight. Each drawer
    contains cards for crates in the warehouse. The indexing system
    defies logic. The Archivist understands it. Probably.

    CARD CATALOG — INDEX TO WAREHOUSE 23
    ═════════════════════════════════════
    
    The catalog extends upward into shadow. Wooden drawers,
    brass handles, yellowed cards within. The organization
    system is... unconventional.
    
    DRAWER LABELS (visible range):
    A-Aardvark through A-Apocalypse
    B-Babel through B-Byzantium  
    C-Cthulhu through C-Cosmic
    ...
    Ω-Omega through Ω-Otherwise
    ∞-Infinite through ∞-Impossible
    ?-Unknown through ?-Unknowable
