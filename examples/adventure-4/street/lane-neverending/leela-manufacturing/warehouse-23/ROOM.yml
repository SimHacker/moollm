    You stand at the entrance of WAREHOUSE 23.
    
    It stretches before you into darkness — row after row after row
    of identical wooden crates, stacked floor to ceiling on industrial
    shelving that disappears into shadow. The warehouse is impossibly
    large. Larger than the building should allow. Larger than makes
    geometric sense.
    
    A single forklift sits idle near the entrance.
    A clipboard hangs from a nail. The top sheet reads:

    Somewhere deep in the stacks, something glows faintly.

    WAREHOUSE 23 — ARTIFACT REPOSITORY
    
    THE SCALE:
    The warehouse extends farther than you can see. The ceiling is
    lost in shadow somewhere above the sodium lights. The aisles
    between shelving units are numbered, but the numbers don't seem
    to follow any logical sequence. Aisle 7 is between Aisles 42 and
    Negative Purple.
    
    THE CRATES:
    Thousands upon thousands of identical wooden crates, each stamped
    with classification codes, dates, and warnings:
    
    • "DO NOT OPEN"
    • "DO NOT OPEN UNTIL [DATE REDACTED]"
    • "DO NOT OPEN EVER"
    • "ESPECIALLY DO NOT OPEN"
    • "OPENING THIS CRATE VOIDS WARRANTY ON REALITY"
    
    Some crates hum. Some glow. One is slightly colder than absolute
    zero, which shouldn't be possible. Another contains something that
    knocks back when you knock.
    
    THE FILING SYSTEM:
    A card catalog near the entrance, wooden drawers stretching up
    beyond sight. Each card contains:
    - Crate number
    - Contents (often just "UNKNOWN" or "DO NOT INVESTIGATE")
    - Date acquired
    - Clearance level
    - Special handling instructions
    
    NOTABLE SECTIONS:
    • Section A: Religious Artifacts (glowing subsection)
    • Section B: Cursed Objects (cold subsection)
    • Section C: Temporal Anomalies (subsection exists on Tuesdays only)
    • Section D: Memetic Hazards (don't read the labels)
    • Section E: "Miscellaneous" (largest section)
    • Section F: Empty (or is it?)
    • Section [REDACTED]: You don't have clearance for this
    
    THE ATMOSPHERE:
    Dust motes hang suspended in the air. Time moves differently here.
    You've been standing at the entrance for either thirty seconds or
    thirty years, it's hard to tell. The warehouse remembers things
    the world has forgotten.

        everything is. Will not tell you.
      catchphrase: "That crate? We have top men working on it."
      
  ambience: |
    The hum of sodium lights. The settling of old crates.
    Distant sounds that might be footsteps, or might be
    something shifting in its container.
    
    Time passes strangely here. Your watch has stopped.
    Or is running backwards. Hard to tell.
    
    Somewhere, something whispers. You're probably imagining it.
