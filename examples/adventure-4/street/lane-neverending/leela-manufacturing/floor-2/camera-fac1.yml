    A camera mounted above the Insight Furnace, watching the
    processing cells and the Big Board. Its lens reflects
    the glow of the furnace. This is FAC1: Leela's second eye.

    This camera watches the most critical part of Leela:
    the Processing Floor where raw data becomes understanding.
    
    CURRENT VIEW:
    • Insight Furnace: Glowing, active, processing
    • Cell A: 3 workers at whiteboard (pose: "animated discussion")
    • Cell B: 2 workers typing (pose: "deep focus")
    • Cell C: 1 worker pacing (pose: "thinking")
    • Cell G: [REDACTED] (pose: [CLASSIFIED])
    • Big Board: 847 green dots, 23 yellow, 3 red
    
    The feed flows into the same pipeline that processes
    its output. FAC1 watches the insights being made,
    and those observations become... more insights.
    
    It's recursive. It's beautiful. It's slightly dizzying.
    
    DETECTED IN LAST HOUR:
    • 1247 object detections
    • 892 pose estimations
    • 47 "EUREKA_MOMENT" events (arms raised suddenly)
    • 23 "DEEP_THINKING" events (stillness > 30 seconds)
    • 8 "COLLABORATION" events (multiple people, same whiteboard)
    • 1 "FURNACE_FLARE" event (brightness spike)
    
    META-OBSERVATION:
    FAC1's feed is processed by the very floor it watches.
    The pipeline detects workers. The workers are working
    on the pipeline. The pipeline detects this detection.
    
    Dr. Unknown says this is fine.
    Cell G says this is "interesting."
    Zone 7 has requested access to the footage.
    (Request denied. For now.)

        You see what FAC1 sees:
        
        The Processing Floor stretches out below. The Insight
        Furnace glows at the center, a warm orange-gold light.
        Workers move between cells, ideas flowing.
        
        On the Big Board: dots changing color.
        Green → Yellow → Green again.
        A problem solved. Another arriving.
        
        And in the reflection of the furnace glass,
        just barely visible: the camera itself.
        Watching.

  lore: |
    FAC1 was installed six months after LOG1, when it became
    clear that understanding the logistics floor wasn't enough.
    Leela needed to watch itself think.
    
    The first time FAC1's feed was processed by the very pipeline
    it observed, there was a brief moment of... something.
    The Insight Furnace flared. The Big Board flickered.
    A single gold container emerged, labeled simply: "?"
    
    That container is now in Warehouse 23.
    Nobody has opened it.
    
    FAC1 continues to watch. The pipeline continues to process.
    The recursion continues to recurse.
    
    Dr. Unknown calls it "self-awareness, industrialized."
    Zone 7 calls it "Phase One."
