    A towering structure of copper pipes, glass chambers, and
    humming machinery. The heart of Leela's processing floor.

    THE INSIGHT FURNACE
    
    A magnificent industrial structure, three stories tall within
    the floor. Copper pipes spiral upward. Glass chambers glow with
    contained energy. Steam vents periodically (dramatically).

    SPECIFICATIONS:
    • Capacity: 50 problems/hour
    • Output: ~47 insights/hour (some problems are harder)
    • Temperature: Variable (depends on problem complexity)
    • Pressure: Concerning but stable
    
    WHAT HAPPENS INSIDE:
    That's... complicated. The process involves:
    1. Problem decomposition
    2. Pattern extraction
    3. Analogical reasoning
    4. Synthesis
    5. Something that might be "inspiration" but is probably steam
    6. Insight crystallization
    
    Nobody fully understands step 5. The Furnace was here before
    the documentation team.
    
    SAFETY NOTICES:
    • "CAUTION: CONTENTS MAY BE PROFOUND"
    • "DO NOT OPEN DURING PROCESSING"
    • "If you hear voices, they're probably insights"
    
  state:
    temperature: 847
    pressure: "high but stable"

        Through the thick glass, you see...
        
        Problems dissolving into their component concepts.
        Patterns forming, breaking, reforming.
        Something that looks almost like understanding.
        
        Then: *DING* — an insight emerges, crystallized and ready.

  warning: |
    The Insight Furnace has been running continuously for 40 years.
    Nobody knows what would happen if it stopped.
    Nobody wants to find out.
