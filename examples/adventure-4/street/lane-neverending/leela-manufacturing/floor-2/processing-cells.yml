    PROCESSING CELLS
    
    Eight fishbowl-style workspaces, each a self-contained think tank:
    
    CELL A — Manufacturing Optimization
    Current problem: "How to make faster widgets without explosions"
    Team size: 4
    Whiteboard coverage: 87%
    Status: 🟢 On track
    
    CELL B — Logistics Puzzles
    Current problem: "The traveling salesman, but he's also a vampire"
    Team size: 3
    Whiteboard coverage: 100% (they're using the floor now)
    Status: 🟡 Needs attention
    
    CELL C — Process Improvement
    Current problem: "Make meetings shorter without losing content"
    Team size: 5
    Whiteboard coverage: 62%
    Status: 🟢 On track
    
    CELL D — Data Analysis
    Current problem: "What does this 3.2 TB of data actually mean"
    Team size: 2 (but they have 12 monitors each)
    Whiteboard coverage: 23% (they prefer terminals)
    Status: 🟢 On track
    
    CELL E — Meta-Problems
    Current problem: "Why do we have so many problems?"
    Team size: 6 (the irony is not lost on them)
    Whiteboard coverage: 100%+ (recursive whiteboards)
    Status: 🟣 "We're not sure what's happening"
    
    CELL F — Edge Cases
    Current problem: "What happens at the boundary of nothing"
    Team size: 2
    Whiteboard coverage: 1 very precise diagram
    Status: 🟢 On track
    
    CELL G — "The Weird Ones"
    Current problem: [CLASSIFIED]
    Team size: Unknown (they wear masks)
    Whiteboard coverage: The whiteboard has been replaced with something else
    Status: 🔴 Don't ask
    
    CELL H — Empty
    Status: Being decontaminated after last week's "incident"
    Available in: 3 days
