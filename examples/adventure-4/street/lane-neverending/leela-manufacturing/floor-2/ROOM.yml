# FLOOR 2 — FACTORY FLOOR
# Where SEEING happens — the heart of Leela vision
#
# THIS IS THE DEMO: Every camera here runs Leela AI.
# What customers see on their factory floors, we see on ours.
# We eat our own dog food. We watch ourselves watching.

  # THE CORE MESSAGE
  what_this_represents: |
    In reality, Leela deploys vision systems to CUSTOMER factories.
    This floor represents what a Leela-enabled factory looks like:
    - Cameras on every station (object detection, pose estimation)
    - Overlays annotating everything (worker safety, equipment status)
    - The Big Board showing insights (not just data — MEANING)
    - Zero surprises (because we saw them coming)

    Floor 2: WHERE SEEING HAPPENS.
    
    This is the heart of what Leela does — computer vision in action.
    Every surface bristles with cameras. Every screen shows annotated
    feeds. Workers move through glowing overlays that track, predict,
    and protect.
    
    Unlike ACME's "ship and pray" approach, here everything is WATCHED.
    Not surveillance — ASSISTANCE. The cameras don't judge. They HELP.
    
    A worker reaches for a heavy box. Overlay: "Ergonomic warning: lift
    with legs, bend detected at 47°." A forklift approaches a blind corner.
    Alert: "Pedestrian detected — slowing." A machine vibrates wrong.
    Prediction: "Bearing failure in 72 hours — schedule maintenance."
    
    In the center of the floor: THE INSIGHT FURNACE, where raw camera
    feeds transform into causal understanding. Neural perception goes in.
    Symbolic reasoning comes out. What happens inside is the Schema
    Mechanism — Drescher's gift, Minsky's dream.
    
    A banner above the Furnace reads:
    
    "We don't make products. We make SIGHT."

    FACTORY FLOOR — WHERE SEEING HAPPENS
    
    THE CAMERA ARRAY:
    Forty-seven cameras, each running Leela vision:
    • Ceiling cameras (overview, flow tracking)
    • Station cameras (pose estimation, ergonomics)
    • Equipment cameras (vibration, thermal, wear)
    • Safety cameras (PPE detection, zone violation)
    Every feed annotated in real-time. Every anomaly flagged.
    
    THE PROCESSING CELLS:
    Eight glass-walled workspaces, each demonstrating a use case:
    • Cell A: Safety monitoring (PPE, ergonomics, pedestrian detection)
    • Cell B: Process optimization (cycle time, bottleneck detection)
    • Cell C: Predictive maintenance (vibration, thermal anomaly)
    • Cell D: Quality control (defect detection, measurement)
    • Cell E: Inventory tracking (object counting, location)
    • Cell F: Edge cases (the weird ones we're still learning)
    • Cell G: Customer simulations (mock-ups of client factories)
    • Cell H: Calibration lab (where we tune the models)
    
    THE INSIGHT FURNACE:
    Where neural perception becomes symbolic understanding:
    • Camera feeds enter (raw pixels, motion, depth)
    • Object detection identifies WHAT (workers, forklifts, packages)
    • Pose estimation shows HOW (body position, equipment state)
    • Context inference understands WHY (intent, process, anomaly)
    • Causal reasoning predicts NEXT (what will happen, what to do)
    
    A sign: "NEURAL → SYMBOLIC → CAUSAL — The Schema Mechanism"
    
    THE BIG BOARD:
    Not dots — INSIGHTS:
    • "Worker 7 approaching fatigue threshold (recommend break)"
    • "Forklift 3 battery at 15% (charging station available)"
    • "Machine 12 vibration anomaly (bearing failure in 72 hours)"
    • "Zone B throughput down 12% (bottleneck at Station 4)"
    
    Unlike ACME's dashboard (all red, always lying), this one is TRUE.
    
  workers:
    - "Process Engineers (always at whiteboards)"
    - "Knowledge Smiths (at the Furnace)"
    - "Insight Wranglers (catching outputs)"
    - "Quality Assurance (testing everything)"
    
  equipment:
    - "The Insight Furnace"
    - "Pattern Recognition Array"
    - "The Big Board"
    - "Whiteboards (87 of them)"
    - "Coffee Machine Mk VII"
