# FLOOR 2 — PROCESSING FLOOR
# Where problems become insights

room:
  name: Leela Floor 2 — Processing Floor
  type: factory_floor
  
  description: |
    The PROCESSING FLOOR is where the magic happens — or rather, where
    the careful, methodical transformation of problems into insights occurs.
    Magic is unreliable. Process is eternal.
    
    The floor is organized into PROCESSING CELLS, each one a self-contained
    workspace where a team attacks a specific problem. Whiteboards cover
    every wall. The air crackles with concentration.
    
    In the center of the floor: THE INSIGHT FURNACE, a massive structure
    that glows with contained energy. Raw problems go in one side.
    Refined insights come out the other. What happens inside is...
    complicated.

    PROCESSING FLOOR — FLOOR 2
    
    THE PROCESSING CELLS:
    Eight glass-walled workspaces, each tackling different problems:
    • Cell A: Manufacturing optimization
    • Cell B: Logistics puzzles
    • Cell C: Process improvement
    • Cell D: Data analysis
    • Cell E: Meta-problems (problems about problems)
    • Cell F: Edge cases
    • Cell G: "The Weird Ones" (you don't want to know)
    • Cell H: Currently empty (being decontaminated)
    
    THE INSIGHT FURNACE:
    A towering structure of copper pipes, glass chambers, and
    humming machinery. Temperature gauges. Pressure valves.
    A sign: "CAUTION: CONTENTS MAY BE PROFOUND"
    
    Inputs: Raw problems (from Intake)
    Outputs: Refined insights (to Shipping)
    Byproducts: Better questions (recycled to Intake)
    
    THE BIG BOARD:
    A massive display showing every problem in process:
    • Green dots: On track
    • Yellow dots: Needs attention
    • Red dots: Stuck (send help)
    • Purple dots: "We're not sure what's happening"
    
    THE COFFEE STATION:
    Industrial-sized. Essential infrastructure. Never runs out.
    A sign: "COFFEE IS NOT OPTIONAL. COFFEE IS PROCESS."
    
  workers:
    - "Process Engineers (always at whiteboards)"
    - "Knowledge Smiths (at the Furnace)"
    - "Insight Wranglers (catching outputs)"
    - "Quality Assurance (testing everything)"
    
  equipment:
    - "The Insight Furnace"
    - "Pattern Recognition Array"
    - "The Big Board"
    - "Whiteboards (87 of them)"
    - "Coffee Machine Mk VII"
