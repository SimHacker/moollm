    A weatherproof camera mounted on a tall pole, its lens sweeping
    across the logistics yard. Wind, rain, or shine — it watches.
    This is LOG1: Leela's first eye, seeing the big picture.

    The camera is mounted on the control tower, overlooking the
    entire logistics operation. It sees trucks, trains, drones,
    containers, and the flow of everything in and out.
    
    CURRENT VIEW:
    • Container Yard: 147/200 TEU occupied
    • Truck Yard: 6 trucks present
    • Rail Siding: 4 cars (1 loading)
    • Drone Pad: 3 drones charging, 2 in flight
    • Pigeon Loft: 24 pigeons (all home)
    
    The feed flows directly into the Video Intake pipeline
    on Floor 1. Every frame analyzed. Every container tracked.
    Every movement logged.
    
    Leela watches itself work.
    And learns.

        You see what LOG1 sees:
        
        The logistics yard spreads out below — a carefully
        organized chaos. Container stacks in colorful towers.
        Trucks queuing at the docks. A train idling on the siding.
        Drones buzzing overhead like mechanical bees.
        
        And in the pigeon loft, one bird pauses mid-step,
        head tilted, as if thinking about the nature of flight.

  lore: |
    LOG1 was the first camera installed when Leela Manufacturing
    opened. It has watched every delivery, every shipment,
    every container movement across this yard.
    
    When the self-observation pipeline was activated, LOG1
    became special: it was Leela's first eye looking at itself.
    
    The philosophical implications are... still being processed.
    (Cell G is working on it.)
    
    LOG1 has seen:
    • 47,823 trucks come and go
    • 12,456 train cars loaded and unloaded
    • 892,341 drone flights
    • 1 pigeon achieve enlightenment
