# Where insights go out into the world

    The SHIPPING DEPARTMENT is a hive of activity. Finished insights
    arrive from the Processing Floor below and get packaged, labeled,
    and dispatched to customers across... everywhere.
    
    Pneumatic tubes whoosh. Drones launch from the roof access. 
    The occasional enlightened pigeon flutters past with a message
    tied to its leg.
    
    A departure board shows outgoing shipments:
