# Mail Room

> *"Delivering insights, one tube at a time."*

The **Mail Room** is the communication hub of Leela Manufacturing — integrating postal services, pneumatic tubes, carrier pigeons, and a surprisingly sophisticated phone bank. If you need to send something anywhere, this is where you come.

Fully integrated with the [Postal System](../../../../skills/postal/).

        Inbox["📥 General Inbox\nLetters, texts, packages"]
        Outbox["📤 General Outbox\nActive provider mode"]
        Sorting["📬 Sorting Bins\nBy destination type"]
    end

        Postal["📮 Postal\nInternal transit"]
        Drone["🛸 Drone\nLane Neverending"]

## Pneumatic Tubes

A brass-and-copper marvel connecting all floors and facilities:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    Hub["🔵 PNEUMATIC HUB"]
    
    Hub --> F1["Tube → Floor 1"]
    Hub --> F2["Tube → Floor 2"]
    Hub --> F3["Tube → Floor 3"]
    Hub --> Roof["Tube → Rooftop"]
    Hub --> Lobby["Tube → Lobby"]
    Hub --> Basement["Tube → Basement"]
    Hub --> Docks["Tube → Loading Docks"]
    Hub --> Pub["Tube → THE PUB 🍺"]

    style Pub fill:#f39c12,color:#fff
```

| Destination | Transit Time | Priority |
|-------------|--------------|----------|
| Floor 1 | 3 seconds | Normal |
| Floor 2 | 3 seconds | Normal |
| Floor 3 | 4 seconds | Normal |
| Rooftop | 5 seconds | Normal |
| Lobby | 2 seconds | Normal |
| Basement | 4 seconds | Normal |
| Loading Docks | 5 seconds | Normal |
| **THE PUB** | **2 seconds** | **PRIORITY** |

The pub tube is the fastest. Some insights are best delivered with a pint.
