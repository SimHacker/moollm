    The LEELA PONY EXPRESS — traditional delivery logistics for realms
    where modern technology fears to tread.
    
    Medieval kingdoms. Enchanted forests. Wild west frontiers.
    Dragon-haunted mountain passes. Places where drones get
    eaten and trucks sink in swamps.
    
    Headquarters: The Carriage House at Leela Manufacturing
    Motto: "Neither rain, nor snow, nor dragons of unusual size..."

    INTEGRATION WITH LEELA LOGISTICS
    ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    
    The Pony Express is fully integrated with the modern
    Leela Logistics network:
    
    HANDOFF POINTS:
    • Incoming: Modern deliveries arrive at Loading Docks
      → Sorted → Transferred to Carriage House
      → Loaded onto appropriate horse transport
      → Dispatched to rustic realms
      
    • Outgoing: Rustic realm packages arrive by horse
      → Received at Carriage House
      → Logged in Central Database (yes, PostgreSQL)
      → Transferred to modern logistics
      → Continue via drone/truck as appropriate
    
    TRACKING:
    • All shipments tracked in PostgreSQL TimescaleDB
    • Rider check-ins at waypoints (carrier pigeon relay)
    • Estimated arrival calculated by route + weather + horse
    • Real-time status: "Last seen: Enchanted Forest waypoint 3"
    
    THE BEAUTY OF IT:
    Packages flow seamlessly between worlds.
    A customer in a medieval kingdom orders from the Leela catalog.
    Drone flies to the realm boundary.
    Pony Express takes it from there.
    Delivered to the castle gate by rider.
    
    Modern efficiency meets traditional reliability.

  philosophy: |
    WHY PONY EXPRESS IN A WORLD OF DRONES?
    
    Because not every realm has WiFi.
    Because some forests eat technology.
    Because dragons think drones are snacks.
    Because some customers PREFER a rider at their gate.
    
    ACME tried automated delivery everywhere.
    Their drone got turned into a toad in the Enchanted Forest.
    Their truck sank in the Swamp of Despair.
    Their "smart anvil" was last seen orbiting a wizard's tower.
    
    Leela adapts. Some realms need horses.
    We have horses. We have riders. We deliver.
    
    The modern and traditional, working together.
    That's the Leela way.

  lore: |
    The Pony Express was established when Leela realized that
    not all customers live in places with roads, electricity,
    or breathable atmosphere for drones.
    
    The first shipment was to a wizard's tower. The drone
    got zapped by a ward. The truck couldn't climb the
    floating island. Henry suggested horses.
    
    "Horses don't care about wards," he said. "They just
    want oats and a pat on the nose."
    
    The wizard got his package. He tipped the rider in
    enchanted horseshoes. Those horseshoes are now on
    Shadowmere, which explains a few things.
    
    Since then, the Pony Express has delivered to:
    • 47 castles
    • 12 enchanted forests
    • 8 dragon lairs (exterior delivery only)
    • 3 underwater kingdoms (waterproof packaging required)
    • 1 floating city (long ladder involved)
    • Countless villages, hamlets, and frontier towns
    
    ACME still hasn't figured out how to deliver to these places.
    Their painted tunnel doesn't work in realms without walls.
