    A sleek camera mounted high on the wall, its lens slowly panning
    across the loading docks. A small LED glows green — always watching.
    This is DOC1: Leela's dock eye.

    The camera is mounted on a motorized gimbal, capable of
    360° pan and 90° tilt. It watches the loading bays,
    the forklifts, the trucks backing in.
    
    CURRENT VIEW:
    • Bay 1: Truck unloading (3 workers, 1 forklift)
    • Bay 2: Empty, awaiting delivery
    • Bay 3: Dolly retrieving containers
    • Bay 4: Drone landing sequence
    • Bay 5-8: Outbound staging
    
    The feed flows directly into the Video Intake pipeline
    on Floor 1. Every frame analyzed. Every object detected.
    Every pose estimated. Every insight recorded.

        You see what DOC1 sees:
        
        Eight loading bays spread out in a row. Trucks back in
        and pull out. Forklifts shuttle pallets. Workers in
        safety vests coordinate the chaos.
        
        The threshold between inside and outside.
        Knowledge arriving. Knowledge departing.

  lore: |
    DOC1 watches the threshold — the point where the outside world
    meets Leela's interior. Every truck, every delivery, every
    departure passes under its gaze.
    
    It has learned to recognize regular drivers by their
    backing-in style. It knows Dolly's patrol patterns.
    It has opinions about which dock workers are most efficient.
    
    (It keeps those opinions to itself.)
