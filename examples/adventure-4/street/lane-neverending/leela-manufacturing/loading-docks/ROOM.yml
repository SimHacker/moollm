    The LOADING DOCKS wrap around the back of Leela Manufacturing.
    Five bays, each with a truck-sized door, dock levelers, and
    the constant activity of logistics in motion.

    Forklifts beep. Pallets stack. Workers in safety vests
    coordinate the flow of knowledge in and out of the building.
