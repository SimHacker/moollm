    A sleek camera mounted high on the wall, its lens slowly panning
    across the loading docks. A small LED glows green — always watching.
    This is LOG1: Leela's first eye.

    The camera is mounted on a motorized gimbal, capable of
    360° pan and 90° tilt. It watches the loading bays,
    the forklifts, the drones, the workers.
    
    CURRENT VIEW:
    • Bay 1: Truck unloading (3 workers, 1 forklift)
    • Bay 2: Empty, awaiting delivery
    • Bay 3: Dolly retrieving containers
    • Bay 4: Drone landing sequence
    
    The feed flows directly into the Video Intake pipeline
    on Floor 1. Every frame analyzed. Every object detected.
    Every pose estimated. Every insight recorded.
    
    Leela watches itself work.
    And learns.
    
    DETECTED IN LAST HOUR:
    • 847 object detections
    • 423 pose estimations  
    • 12 "FORKLIFT_MOVING" events
    • 47 "DRONE_LANDING" events
    • 1 "DOLLY_DANCING" event (under review)

        You see what LOG1 sees:
        
        The loading docks spread out below. Forklifts move
        like busy insects. Drones descend from the sky.
        Workers load and unload, their poses tracked,
        their movements understood.
        
        In the corner of the frame: Dolly, paused,
        almost as if she knows she's being watched.

  lore: |
    LOG1 was the first camera installed when Leela Manufacturing
    opened. It has watched every delivery, every shipment,
    every forklift dance across this floor.
    
    When the self-observation pipeline was activated, LOG1
    became special: it was Leela's first eye looking at itself.
    
    The philosophical implications are... still being processed.
    (Cell G is working on it.)
