description: |
    Lane Neverending stretches west from the pub. This section has
    an older feel — the cobblestones are more worn, the lamp posts
    more ornate, the buildings taller with that pre-crash architecture
    that said "we're building forever."
    
    On the SOUTH side of the street, LEELA MANUFACTURING INTELLIGENCE
    rises three stories — a converted factory with tall arched windows
    and smokestacks that emit sparks of light instead of smoke. The
    sign reads: "5 Lane Neverending — Industrial Knowledge & Insight."
    
    A CLOCK TOWER rises from a building on the north side, its face
    showing a time that may or may not be accurate. Nobody's checked
    in years. Nobody needs to. Time is flexible here.
    
    To the EAST, The Rusty Lantern beckons. To the WEST, the lane
    continues toward the older parts of town.
    
examine: |
    LEELA MANUFACTURING INTELLIGENCE (5 Lane Neverending):
    Red brick industrial building, three stories, south side of street.
    Tall arched windows reveal conveyor belts, workstations, the
    occasional flash of insight being packaged for delivery.
    Smokestacks emit ideas, not pollution. The loading dock around
    back accepts "RAW DATA" deliveries.
    
    Neighbor to The Rusty Lantern — the pub is just one door east.
    Knowledge and ale, side by side. As it should be.
    
    THE CLOCK TOWER (6 Lane Neverending):
    North side. The clock shows 3:47 (always has, always will).
    A small plaque: "Donated by the Habitat Historical Society,
    in memory of pixels past."
    
    OTHER STOREFRONTS:
    • 4 Lane Neverending — A dusty antique shop? The window is too
      grimy to see through clearly
    
    ATMOSPHERE:
    This section feels like it remembers more than it says. The
    cobblestones have stories. The lamp posts have seen things.
    Virtual history happened here.
