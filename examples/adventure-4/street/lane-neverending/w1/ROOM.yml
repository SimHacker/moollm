    Lane Neverending stretches west from the pub. This section tells
    the story of two economies in a single glance:
    
    On the SOUTH side: LEELA MANUFACTURING INTELLIGENCE rises three
    stories — a converted factory with tall arched windows and smokestacks
    that emit sparks of light instead of smoke. The sign reads:
    "5 Lane Neverending — Industrial Knowledge & Insight."
    Thriving on information. Building understanding.
    
    On the NORTH side: ACME SURPLUS sits empty and boarded up.
    "4 Lane Neverending — EVERYTHING MUST GO" (it did).
    Mail-order ate the brick-and-mortar business. The painted tunnel
    on the boarded window is the only thing that still works here
    (for some people, anyway).
    
    A study in contrasts. Knowledge thrives. Gimmicks fade.
    But the tunnel... the tunnel still has secrets.
    
  examine: |
    LEELA MANUFACTURING INTELLIGENCE (5 Lane Neverending, SOUTH):
    Red brick industrial building, three stories, south side of street.
    Tall arched windows reveal conveyor belts, workstations, the
    occasional flash of insight being packaged for delivery.
    Smokestacks emit ideas, not pollution. The loading dock around
    back accepts "RAW DATA" deliveries.
    
    Neighbor to The Gezelligheid Grotto — the pub is just one door east.
    Knowledge and ale, side by side. As it should be.
    
    ACME SURPLUS (4 Lane Neverending, NORTH):
    Dusty storefront, north side, directly across from Leela.
    Once sold portable holes, rocket skates, and anvils.
    Now sells nothing. Mail-order killed the retail star.
    
    The famous PAINTED TUNNEL is here — on a boarded-up section.
    Looks SO real. You CANNOT run through it. (Others can.)
    
    A one-anvil memorial to the brick-and-mortar economy.
    
    THE CONTRAST:
    Look south: a factory full of knowledge workers, glowing screens,
    ideas becoming real.
    
    Look north: a failed storefront, dusty windows, a tunnel that
    only works for delivery drivers.
    
    The future and the past, facing each other across the cobblestones.

        The front doors of LEELA MANUFACTURING INTELLIGENCE.
        Red brick, three stories, tall arched windows.
        A sign: "5 Lane Neverending — Industrial Knowledge & Insight"
        You can see the scale model glowing in the lobby.

      description: |
        Next door to Leela, a narrow one-story storefront with...
        
        Wait. What IS that sign?
        
        A 40-foot neon monstrosity screams "NO AI TOWER" in hot pink
        and gold over a humble building with newspapered windows.
        Old Las Vegas casino aesthetic. Buzzing. Flickering.
        The arrow points DOWN at the building. "SINCE 2026."
        
        The tower is one story. The sign is four stories of attitude.

        The front door of ACME SURPLUS. Closed. Locked.
        Dusty windows. Empty shelves. A painted tunnel that doesn't work.

            CRASH! The door SHATTERS. Splinters fly.

            ROLL: Dodge (DC 12) or take 2d6 bludgeoning.

            THUD. The door doesn't budge.
            
            Plaque: "ACME DOOR — Cartoon Durability™"
            
            You bounce off. Still on the street.
            Someone at Leela watches. Writing something down.
            
            You can try again.

      notes: |
        Violence WORKS, eventually. The door is Cartoon Durable but not
        infinitely so. Each attempt has a 35% base chance, improving
        slightly with persistence (desperation bonus).
        
        Consequences:
        - Donna ALWAYS knows (she has cameras everywhere)
        - Traps still trigger on entry
        - Leela Manufacturing witnesses and judges
        - Loud — draws attention
        
        But hey, you're IN. That's what matters to some people.
