  description: |
    Lane Neverending stretches west from the pub. This section has
    an older feel — the cobblestones are more worn, the lamp posts
    more ornate, the buildings taller with that pre-crash architecture
    that said "we're building forever."
    
    A CLOCK TOWER rises from one of the buildings, its face showing
    a time that may or may not be accurate. Nobody's checked in years.
    Nobody needs to. Time is flexible here.
    
    To the EAST, The Rusty Lantern beckons. To the WEST, the lane
    continues toward the older parts of town.
    
  examine: |
    THE CLOCK TOWER:
    Part of 6 Lane Neverending. The clock shows 3:47 (always has,
    always will). A small plaque: "Donated by the Habitat Historical
    Society, in memory of pixels past."
    
    STOREFRONTS:
    • 4 Lane Neverending — A dusty antique shop? The window is too
      grimy to see through clearly
    • 6 Lane Neverending — The Clock Tower building, ground floor empty
    
    ATMOSPHERE:
    This section feels like it remembers more than it says. The
    cobblestones have stories. The lamp posts have seen things.
    Virtual history happened here.
