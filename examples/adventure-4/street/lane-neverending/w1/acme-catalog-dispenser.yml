    A battered metal dispenser stands on the sidewalk in front of 
    ACME Surplus. It looks like a newspaper vending machine, but 
    instead of newspapers, it's packed with ACME Mail-Order Catalogs.
    
    A cheerful sign on the front:
    
    ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
    │     📦 FREE ACME CATALOGS! 📦      │
    │                                     │
    │   "If It Exists, ACME Makes It!™"   │
    │                                     │

    └─────────────────────────────────────┘
    
    The dispenser is dented, slightly rusty, and has scorch marks
    on one corner. A small note at the bottom:
    
    "ACME is not responsible for: paper cuts, spontaneous ordering,
     catalog-induced optimism, or the Wile E. Coyote curse."
    
    Through the glass front, you can see stacks of catalogs.
    The coyote on each cover seems to be watching you.

    ACME CATALOG DISPENSER
    ═══════════════════════
    
    The dispenser is about 4 feet tall, made of weathered metal with
    a glass front. Inside, neatly stacked catalogs await.
    
    THE CATALOGS:
    Each one shows a smiling coyote giving a thumbs up.
    Is that... soot on his face? And bandages?
    The ACME logo gleams despite the dust.
    
    THE MECHANISM:
    Unlike most newspaper dispensers, this one has NO coin slot.
    Just a handle. Pull and receive.
    
    "FREE" is emphasized in several places.
    Suspiciously emphasized.
    
    THE FINE PRINT:
    A tiny label on the side:
    "Catalogs are free. Hope is free. Regret is earned."
    
    THE CAMERA:
    Looking across the street, you notice a camera in Leela's lobby
    window is pointed directly at this dispenser.
    CAM-ACME-01 is watching.
    
    THE IRONY:
    The store behind this dispenser is CLOSED and BOARDED UP.
    But the catalogs keep coming.
    Someone is refilling this dispenser.
    At night.
    You never see them.
    
  actions:
    TAKE_CATALOG:
      description: "Tear off a free catalog from the dispenser"
      aliases: [take, get, grab, pull, tear]
      effect: |
        You pull the handle. The dispenser creaks open.
        
        *riiiiip*
        
        A catalog tears off into your hands. It's surprisingly
        light — almost weightless. Just a reference, really.
        
        The coyote on the cover winks at you.
        
        ...Wait, did it actually wink?
        
        INVENTORY: + ACME MAIL-ORDER CATALOG (ref)
        
        (This is an INSTANCE pointing to ./acme-catalog.yml)
        (The prototype stays here. You carry a lightweight pointer.)
        
        Somewhere across the street, CAM-ACME-01 logs:
        "CATALOG_DISPENSED: entity_unknown. Probability of regret: 78%"
        
    READ_IN_DISPENSER:
      description: "Browse the catalog without taking it"
      aliases: [read, browse, look, flip]
      effect: |
        You lean in and flip through a catalog still in the rack.
        
        The glass front provides just enough access to browse...
        
        ADVENTURE GEAR... DETECTION DEVICES... FOOD & CONSUMABLES...
        TRAPS & DEVICES... DISGUISES... HUNTING & CAPTURE...
        MYSTERY & EXPERIMENTAL...
        
        Every page promises wonder.
        Every page has tiny asterisks.
        Every product has a malfunction chance.
        
        You can ORDER from here too — just say what you want.
        The dispenser has a small speaker and a "Talk to Order" button.
        
        "ORDER [item] FROM ACME"
        
        📍 FREE PICKUP here (wait by the dispenser, could take a while)
        🚚 DELIVER TO [room] for 5-10 gold (2-4 turns, anywhere!)
        
    ORDER:

      aliases: [order, buy, purchase]
      usage: "ORDER [item] FROM ACME"
      effect: |
        You press the "Talk to Order" button on the dispenser.
        
        *crackle*
        
        "ACME ORDER DESK! What can we PROBABLY deliver today?"
        
        You state your order. The speaker crackles again.
        
        "EXCELLENT choice! Delivery options:
        
         📍 FREE PICKUP — Right here! At the dispenser!
            Delivery in... well, we'll get it here eventually.
            Could be 2 turns. Could be 20. You'll know when you hear
            the truck drive through the painted tunnel.
            Just wait right here! We recommend a good book.
            
         🚚 ROOM DELIVERY — Any room in the adventure! 
            Shipping: 5 gold per item, 10 for hazmat (most things).
            Delivery in 2-4 turns! Via parachute, roadrunner, 
            catapult, or boing — we choose based on vibes.
            
         What'll it be? PICKUP or DELIVER TO [location]?"
        
        *click*
        
        The dispenser hums for a moment, then goes quiet.
        
        Somewhere, a coyote howls.
        
    EXAMINE_SCORCH_MARKS:
      description: "Look at the burn marks on the dispenser"
      aliases: [scorch, burn, marks]
      effect: |
        The scorch marks on the corner are... extensive.
        
        Someone clearly had an ACME product malfunction RIGHT HERE.
        The pattern suggests a small explosion, followed by
        someone being launched upward, then landing nearby.
        
        A small plaque has been welded to the spot:
        
        "IN MEMORY OF ORDER #4,782
         Wile E. Coyote's attempt to 'test before shipping'
         He survived. He always survives.
         Products ship as-is."
         
    KICK_DISPENSER:
      description: "Kick the dispenser"
      aliases: [kick, hit, punch]
      effect: |
        *CLANG*
        
        The dispenser shakes. A catalog falls out onto the ground.
        
        The speaker crackles to life:
        
        "ACME thanks you for your enthusiasm! Would you like to
         order some ACME ROCKET SKATES? Perfect for quick getaways!
         Only 40% chance of random destination!"
        
        *click*
        
        ...the dispenser remembered that.
        
  delivery:
    pickup:
      location: "Right here — in front of the closed ACME Surplus storefront"
      cost: free
      timing: |
        Variable. Could be 2 turns, could be 20.
        ACME delivery trucks emerge from the painted tunnel
        at unpredictable intervals. Sometimes at night.
        Sometimes when you blink.
        
        Waiting is free. Patience is tested.
        
        "The pickup window is always open. The window of opportunity... varies."
      experience: |
        You hear a truck approaching... but from WHERE?
        
        Through the painted tunnel, an ACME truck emerges.
        (The wall is solid. The truck is real. Don't ask.)
        
        A package is tossed onto the sidewalk.
        The truck vanishes back through the wall.
        
        Your order has arrived! (Inspect before use. Warranty void.)

      Free delivery TO HERE. Just... wait.
      The sidewalk is comfortable enough.
      Leela employees have brought lawn chairs.
      (They're watching for research purposes.)
      
    waiting_activities:
      - "Read your catalog. Dream of possibilities."
      - "Watch the painted tunnel. Notice patterns."

    theories:
      - "ACME delivery drivers use the painted tunnel"
      - "The dispenser is connected to a pocket dimension"
      - "Roadrunner express — they're too fast to see"
      - "It just... refills. Don't question it."

    relationship_to_leela: |
      Leela employees pass this dispenser every day.
      Some take catalogs — for "research purposes."
      Some study the malfunction rates — "competitive analysis."
      Some just shake their heads and keep walking.
      
      CAM-ACME-01 logs every interaction.
      The data is... educational.
      
  secret:
    the_first_catalog: |
      If you take the VERY FIRST catalog in the stack (at the back),
      it's different. Older. The coyote on the cover isn't smiling.
      
      This is the ORIGINAL ACME catalog from 1949.
      The products are the same. The prices are lower.
      The malfunction rates are... not listed.
      
      "ACME: A Fine Company"
      (This was before the rebranding.)
      
    the_speaker: |
      The "Talk to Order" speaker connects to... somewhere.
      Not a call center. Not a warehouse.
      Somewhere that always answers on the first crackle.
      Somewhere that knows what you're going to order
      before you say it.
      
      The delivery trucks come from the painted tunnel.
      They always have.
      
  quotes:
    tom: |
      "Tom has observed the dispenser."
      "Tom has cataloged the catalog."
      "Tom notes: free products have hidden costs."
      "Tom notes: instances are weightless references."
      "Tom suggests: drop one in the kitchen. We already did."

       0 anvils landed on anyone. So far.
       
       The malfunction rate holds steady at 32%.
       We don't know why it's always 32%.

      "I took a catalog once. For research.
       Read the whole thing. Every product. Every warning.
       The malfunction percentages aren't random — they're TUNED.
       Someone optimized for maximum ironic comedy.
       
       That's either genius or madness.
       With ACME, it's probably both."
