    THE CLOCK TOWER OF LANE NEVERENDING
    
    Four clock faces, one on each side, all showing 3:47.
    They've shown 3:47 for as long as anyone can remember.
    
    A plaque at the base:
    
    ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │  DONATED BY THE                         │
    │  HABITAT HISTORICAL SOCIETY             │
    │  "In memory of pixels past"             │
    │                                         │
    │  The clock stopped at 3:47 on the day  │
    │  the first avatar logged off forever.   │
    │  We keep it frozen in their honor.      │
    └─────────────────────────────────────────┘
    
    Some say the clock still ticks — just very, very slowly.
    One tick per virtual century.
    
    At night, the faces glow softly. The mechanism hums.
    Time passes everywhere except here.

        You hear... something. A faint tick? Or just your imagination?
        
        The tower is patient. It has all the time in the world.
        Literally. It's not using any of it.
        
    WAIT:

      effect: |
        You wait.
        
        And wait.
        
        ...
        
        The clock does not move. But somehow, you feel like
        you've been here for years. Time is weird on Lane Neverending.
        
  secret:
    the_truth: |
      The clock isn't broken. It's waiting.
      When the last virtual world shuts down, the clock will chime.
      Once. And then silence forever.
      
      Until then: 3:47. Always 3:47.
