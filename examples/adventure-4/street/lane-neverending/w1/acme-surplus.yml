    A dusty storefront with a faded sign: "ACME SURPLUS — EVERYTHING MUST GO"
    Everything did go. The store is empty now.
    
    NORTH side of the street, directly across from Leela Manufacturing.
    MORTAL ENEMIES. A study in contrasts: the bustling knowledge factory
    on one side, the fly-by-night gimmick shop on the other.
    
    One section of the windows is boarded up. Someone has painted
    a TUNNEL on the boards — a perfect trompe l'oeil leading into
    darkness. It looks... very runnable.
    
  philosophy: |
    ACME represents everything wrong with tech:
    - Ship fast, break things, blame the customer
    - Pivot constantly, never fix the core problem
    - Marketing over engineering
    - "Disruptive" products that don't work
    - Funded by VCs who love a good narrative
    
    The ur-example of every tech bubble:
    - Portable holes were their NFTs
    - Rocket skates were their crypto tokens
    - Painted tunnels are their ChatGPT wrappers
    - "ACME GPT: It hallucinates, but entertainingly!"
    
  pivot_history:
    - era: Classic
      business: Mail-order gimmicks
      products: [anvils, rockets, portable holes]
      outcome: Products didn't work
      
    - era: Web 1.0
      business: E-commerce
      products: [same products, now online!]
      outcome: Products still didn't work
      
    - era: Web 2.0
      business: Social anvils
      slogan: "Share your anvil drops!"
      outcome: Nobody shared
      
    - era: Crypto
      business: ACME Coin, NFT failures
      slogan: "Own your anvil on-chain"
      outcome: Rug pulled
      
    - era: AI (current)
      business: ACME GPT, AI Wrappers
      slogan: "ChatGPT but for coyotes"
      outcome: Hallucinates, but entertainingly

    ACME SURPLUS — 4 LANE NEVERENDING (NORTH SIDE)
    
    The windows are dusty but not boarded. Inside, empty shelves
    stretch into darkness. A few price tags flutter in a draft
    from somewhere.
    
    THE SIGN:
    "ACME SURPLUS — EVERYTHING MUST GO!"
    (In smaller letters: "And it did. Sorry.")
    
    WINDOW DISPLAY:
    • An empty pedestal labeled "PORTABLE HOLE (SOLD)"
    • A sign: "ROCKET SKATES — OUT OF STOCK INDEFINITELY"
    • A faded poster of a coyote looking disappointed
    • One (1) slightly dented anvil (display model, not for sale)
    
    THE PAINTED TUNNEL:
    One section of window is boarded up with plywood. On the plywood,
    someone has painted a REMARKABLY convincing tunnel entrance.
    The perspective is perfect. The shadows are just right. It looks
    like you could run straight through into the hillside beyond.
    
    You cannot.
    
    Trust us.
    
    A small pile of impact marks and feathers at the base suggests
    others have tried. A sign has been added:
    
    "THIS IS A PAINTING. YOU CANNOT RUN THROUGH IT.
     (Yes, we know it looks real. That's the problem.)"
    
    THE DOOR:
    Locked, but the lock looks... negotiable. A small sign:
    "CLOSED FOR INVENTORY (checking what we have left: nothing)"
    
    A note taped to the door:
    "For genuine ACME products, visit The Rusty Lantern kitchen.
    We're not responsible for anything purchased there either."
    
    GRAFFITI:
    Someone spray-painted "MEEP MEEP" on the wall.
    Someone else crossed it out and wrote "TOO SOON."
    
  actions:
    PEEK:
      description: "Look through the dusty window"
      effect: |
        You cup your hands against the glass and peer inside...
        
        Empty shelves. Dust motes floating in dim light.
        A cash register that's clearly been cleaned out.
        
        But wait — is that a box in the back? Labeled...
        "DO NOT OPEN — SERIOUSLY — WE MEAN IT"?
        
        Probably nothing. Probably.
        
    KNOCK:
      description: "Knock on the door"
      effect: |
        *knock knock knock*
        
        Silence.
        
        Then, from deep inside: a distant *crash*, followed by
        what sounds like a "meep."
        
        ...probably just the building settling.
        
    READ_ANVIL:
      description: "Examine the anvil in the window"
      effect: |
        The anvil sits on a small pedestal. A tag hangs from it:
        
        "ACME ANVIL (Display Model)
        Weight: Exactly right for comedic timing
        Material: Cartoon-grade iron
        NOT FOR SALE
        
        (We learned our lesson.)"
        
    RUN_INTO_TUNNEL:
      description: "Sprint at the painted tunnel"
      aliases: [run, sprint, enter tunnel, go through tunnel]
      effect: |
        You back up. You stretch. You get a running start.
        
        The tunnel looks SO REAL. The physics say it should work.
        Everything about it says "run through me."
        
        You sprint. Full speed. Arms pumping. Wind in your face.
        
        *THWACK*
        
        You hit solid plywood. Of course you do. It's a painting.
        
        You slide down the boards, leaving a you-shaped impact mark
        that joins the collection of previous attempts.
        
        From somewhere nearby, you hear: "meep meep."
        
        You look around. Nobody's there.
        
        (You take 0 damage. Pride is another matter.)
        
    STUDY_TUNNEL:
      description: "Examine the painted tunnel closely"
      effect: |
        You study the painting carefully...
        
        It's REALLY good. Museum quality. The depth is perfect.
        The shadows are accurate to the current time of day.
        The darkness inside seems to... move?
        
        For a moment, you could SWEAR you see something running
        toward you from deep inside the painted tunnel.
        
        Then it's just paint again.
        
        A signature in the corner: "W.E.C. — I'll get it right next time"
        
  rumors:
    deliveries: |
      People say they've seen ACME delivery trucks emerge from the tunnel.
      
      At 3 AM, when nobody's watching, vans painted with the ACME logo
      roll out of the "painting" carrying crates to unknown destinations.
      
      Drones buzz through it like it's an open door.
      
      Delivery boys on bicycles pedal straight through without slowing,
      packages balanced on their heads, whistling cheerfully.
      
      Service technicians in jumpsuits disappear into it with toolboxes
      and emerge hours later, covered in soot, muttering about "the warehouse."
      
      But when YOU try it? Plywood. Every time.
      
      Some say you need an ACME Employee ID badge.
      Some say you need to not WANT it to work.
      Some say it only works if you're on the clock.
      
      Nobody knows for sure. The tunnel keeps its secrets.
      
  secret:
    the_back_room: |
      There IS something in the back. A single box that wouldn't sell.
      Inside: an ACME Product that works EXACTLY as intended.
      
      Nobody knows what to do with it.
      
      It's terrifying.
      
    the_tunnel: |
      The tunnel IS real. But only for:
      - Roadrunners
      - ACME employees (delivery, service, drone operators)
      - Anyone who genuinely doesn't think about it
      
      Everyone else just hits plywood.
      
      It's not fair. But then again, ACME products never were.
      
    acme_logistics: |
      The tunnel connects to the ACME Distribution Network — a series
      of painted tunnels, fake doors, and impossible spaces that span
      the entire virtual world.
      
      How do ACME products arrive so fast? The tunnel network.
      How do they always find you? The tunnel network.
      Why do the products never work right? That's a different department.
      
  rivalry:
    enemy: Leela Manufacturing
    location: Directly across the street (5 Lane Neverending)
    intensity: MORTAL
    
    why_they_hate_leela: |
      Leela makes them look bad.
      
      Every time Leela ships a product that WORKS, it reminds everyone
      that ACME products DON'T. Every time Leela debugs instead of pivots,
      every time Leela documents instead of "moving fast," every time
      Leela's knowledge economy generates sustainable value instead of
      burning through another funding round — ACME looks worse.
      
      ACME's entire business model depends on customers not knowing better.
      Leela teaches customers to know better.
      
    why_leela_hates_them: |
      ACME makes AI look bad.
      
      Every time ACME ships a broken chatbot wrapped around someone else's
      model, every time their "AI anvil" hallucinates its own weight, every
      time their "smart rocket" decides cliffs are goals — it poisons the
      well for everyone.
      
      Leela spends 30% of support time explaining: "No, we're not like ACME."
      
      ACME is the reason people distrust AI. ACME is the reason "ChatGPT
      wrapper" is an insult. ACME is the reason investors now ask "but
      does it actually WORK?" (As if that should ever have been optional.)
      
    the_philosophical_war: |
      ACME believes: Ship fast, pivot faster, blame the customer.
      Leela believes: Build carefully, debug thoroughly, improve from feedback.
      
      ACME believes: AI is magic, slap GPT on it and ship.
      Leela believes: AI needs constraints, structure, memory, context.
      
      ACME believes: "Disruptive" means breaking things.
      Leela believes: "Disruptive" means making things work that didn't before.
      
      They cannot both be right.
      
    incidents:
      - name: The Anvil Incident
        date: "Last Tuesday"
        description: |
          An ACME delivery drone dropped an anvil on Leela's loading dock.
          "Accidental route optimization," ACME claimed.
          The anvil had "ACME GPT: NOW WITH GRAVITY AWARENESS" printed on it.
          It fell.
          
      - name: The Wrapper War
        date: Ongoing
        description: |
          ACME keeps releasing ChatGPT wrappers that compete with Leela products.
          "ACME Insight Engine!" "ACME Knowledge Factory!" "ACME Intelligence!"
          They all hallucinate. They all break. They all pivot to something new.
          Leela keeps shipping things that work.
          The cobblestones between them grow colder.
          
      - name: The Painted Tunnel Dispute
        date: "Since the beginning"
        description: |
          ACME claims their painted tunnel technology is "revolutionary AI."
          Leela points out it only works for ACME employees.
          "That's a feature!" says ACME.
          "That's fraud," says Leela.
          The debate continues.
