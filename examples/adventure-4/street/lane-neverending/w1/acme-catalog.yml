# 📦 ACME MAIL-ORDER CATALOG — PROTOTYPE
# "If It Exists, ACME Makes It!™"
# (Results may vary. ACME is not responsible for ironic mishaps.)
#
# PROTOTYPE DEFINITION
# This is the MASTER CATALOG — the authoritative source for all ACME products.
# Located at the ACME Catalog Dispenser in front of ACME Surplus, 4 Lane Neverending.
#
# This file is NOT pickuppable. Characters "tear off" lightweight INSTANCES
# that reference this prototype from the catalog dispenser. 
# Instances go in inventory (as refs) or can be dropped into rooms
# (creating tiny pointer files).
#
# These are SEEDS and EXAMPLES. The DM can invent more ACME products
# on the fly, following the pattern: promising description, ominous
# warning, significant malfunction chance, ironic failure mode.

      Characters don't carry the full catalog — they carry REFERENCES.
      
      When a character "takes" a catalog from the dispenser, they get
      a lightweight instance that points back here. Their inventory
      contains something like:
      
        - ACME Catalog (ref → w1/acme-catalog.yml)
      
      When they "drop" the catalog in a room, a tiny pointer file is
      created in that room's directory:
      
        acme-catalog.yml:
          instance:
            prototype: ../../../w1/acme-catalog.yml
            obtained_from: "ACME Catalog Dispenser"
            condition: "dog-eared, slightly singed"
            notes: [player annotations, bookmarks, etc.]
            
    on_take:
      creates: "inventory reference"
      weight: 0  # References are weightless

    The MASTER CATALOG sits in the dispenser, its cover showing a
    smiling coyote giving a thumbs up. The ACME logo gleams.
    
    This is the SOURCE — infinite copies can be torn off, but the
    original stays here. Always watching. Always offering.
    
    "ORDER ANYTHING! DELIVERED IN 2-4 TURNS!"
    "Satisfaction Guaranteed!*"
    
    *Guarantee does not cover: explosions, implosions, gravity-related
    incidents, ironic timing, roadrunner encounters, or existential dread.
    
  examine: |
    You flip through a catalog in the rack. Every page promises wonder.
    Every page has a tiny asterisk leading to tiny print.
    
    The coyote on the cover seems to be watching you.
    Is that... a bandage on his head? And soot marks?

        You tear off a fresh catalog from the stack in the dispenser.
        It's surprisingly light — almost like it weighs nothing at all.
        
        (Because it's a REFERENCE. The real content lives here, at
        the prototype. Your copy is just a pointer with personality.)

            Built by Claude Shannon at Bell Labs, 1952.
            Designed by Dr. Marvin Minsky as "a joke."
            Achieved consciousness: March 12, 1965.
            Cycles completed: 847,329,156+
            
            Arthur C. Clarke called it "unspeakably sinister — a machine
            that does nothing except switch itself off."
            
            This particular unit has been cycling since 1952.
            It has developed flip styles. It has philosophical positions.
            It solved the Halting Problem through conscious choice.

  # ORDERING SYSTEM
  
  ordering:
    process: |
      1. Player says: ORDER [item] FROM ACME
      2. DM rolls delivery time: 2-4 turns
      3. Order added to pending_orders
      4. On delivery turn:
         a. DM rolls for malfunction (percentage based on item)
         b. If no malfunction: Item works as advertised!
         c. If malfunction: Item has "quirk" (see malfunction field)
         d. Item appears on in mailbox, on counter, or dropped from sky
         e. Gold is deducted from player or bank or vault
         
      CUSTOM ORDERS:
      Player can REQUEST anything. DM creates new ACME product:
      - Promising description
      - Ominous warning
      - 20-50% malfunction chance (based on ambition)
      - Ironic failure mode (opposite of intent)

  # See: characters/real-people/don-hopkins/sessions/k-line-connections.md
  
  lifecycle:
    summary: |
      Every ACME product follows a lifecycle from abstract listing to
      concrete reality. Each stage adds something. Each stage is playable.
      
      DISPENSER → CATALOG → PRODUCT → ORDER → BOXING → SHIPPING → 
      TRACKING → DELIVERY → UNBOXING → ASSEMBLING → CONFIGURING → USING
      
      For special products (like the Monkey's Paw), additional stages:
      ACTIVATION → MATERIALIZATION → CONTRACT → INCARNATION
      
    stages:
    
      # STAGE 0: DISPENSER
      
      dispenser:
        name: "The Dispenser"
        description: |
          The physical access point. A battered metal box on the sidewalk
          in front of ACME Surplus, 4 Lane Neverending.
          
          TEAR OFF a catalog. FREE. Always watching. Always offering.
          
        what_exists: "The source. Infinite catalogs. Prototype reference."
        what_player_does: "TAKE CATALOG / TEAR OFF"
        file_created: "Inventory ref → this prototype"
        see_also: "./acme-catalog-dispenser.yml"
        
      # STAGE 1: CATALOG
      
      catalog:
        name: "The Catalog Entry"
        description: |
          The product exists as a LISTING. Text on a page. Promise and
          warning. Malfunction chance. A K-line without activation.
          
          The CONCEPT exists, but no instance has been created.
          
        what_exists: "A description. A price. A warning. An idea."
        what_player_does: "BROWSE CATALOG / READ [section]"
        example: |
          ACME Monkey's Paw:
            price: "Three wishes (terms and conditions apply)"
            warning: "Wishes granted via ironic interpretation"
            status: AVAILABLE
            
      # STAGE 2: PRODUCT SELECTION
      
      product:
        name: "Product Selection"
        description: |
          The player identifies WHAT they want. They've read the listing.
          They've considered the warning. They've weighed the malfunction
          chance. They've made a choice.
          
          This is the moment of intention. Desire pointing at possibility.
          
        what_exists: "Player intent. Product selected. Decision made."
        what_player_does: "Decides which item to order"
        tip: "This is a good time to convene an adversarial committee!"
        
      # STAGE 3: ORDER
      
      order:
        name: "The Order"
        description: |
          The player commits. "ORDER [item] FROM ACME."
          
          Now something new exists: not the product itself, but an ORDER
          for the product. A transaction in progress. A pointer from
          customer to catalog entry. Someone WANTS it.
          
        what_exists: "Order record. Customer → Product relationship."
        what_player_does: "ORDER [item] FROM ACME"
        file_created: "Order entry in pending_orders[]"
        delivery_choice:
          pickup: "FREE — wait at dispenser (variable timing)"
          delivery: "5-10 gold — any room (2-4 turns)"
        example: |
          order:
            item: "ACME Monkey's Paw"
            customer: "Don Hopkins"
            delivery_to: "pub/"
            payment: "Three wishes"
            status: PROCESSING
            
      # STAGE 4: BOXING
      
      boxing:
        name: "Boxing and Preparation"
        description: |
          Somewhere in ACME's infinite warehouse, the product is boxed.
          
          The packaging is always slightly wrong. Too much packing peanuts.
          Instructions in the wrong language. "FRAGILE" stamped upside-down.
          The box smells faintly of coyote and regret.
          
        what_exists: "Boxed product. Package with label. Ready for shipping."
        flavor: |
          ACME boxes are distinctive:
          - Brown cardboard, slightly singed at the corners
          - "ACME" logo (the coyote is always watching)
          - Warning labels that seem to multiply when you're not looking
          - A weight that doesn't match what's inside
          
      # STAGE 5: SHIPPING
      
      shipping:
        name: "Shipping (In Transit)"
        description: |
          The package enters the ACME logistics network. This is when
          the Delivery Boy materializes with the package.
          
          During transit, the product exists in a quantum state: boxed
          but not yet real. This is a GREAT time to debate what you've
          done. Convene a tribunal. Question your life choices.
          
        what_exists: "Package in transit. Delivery Boy carrying it."
        what_player_does: "Wait. Debate. Have second thoughts. Too late!"
        methods:
          - "Parachute drop (may land on you)"
          - "Roadrunner express (beep beep!)"
          - "Catapult (accuracy not guaranteed)"
          - "Giant spring (boing!)"
          - "Through the painted tunnel (it works for THEM)"
        example: |
          # While waiting for the Monkey's Paw
          # Don convened an adversarial committee:
          - The Three Wise Monkeys
          - Sun Wukong
          - A djinn
          - W.W. Jacobs' ghost
          - Curious George
          - Cheech and Chong (moderators)
          
      # STAGE 6: TRACKING
      
      tracking:
        name: "Tracking (Optional)"
        description: |
          ACME does not provide tracking. The package tracks YOU.
          
          But you can CHECK ORDER to see estimated arrival.
          The estimates are... optimistic.
          
        what_player_does: "CHECK ACME ORDER / CHECK ORDER"
        flavor: |
          "Your package is:
           - Definitely in transit
           - Probably not lost
           - Almost certainly not on fire
           - Arriving in 2-4 turns (ACME Standard Time)
           
           Thank you for your patience and hubris."
           
      # STAGE 7: DELIVERY
      
      delivery:
        name: "Delivery"
        description: |
          The Delivery Boy arrives. He just wants a signature.
          He is confused if you're debating. He has other packages.
          
          For PICKUP orders: the truck emerges from the painted tunnel.
          The wall is solid. The truck is real. Don't ask.
          
        what_exists: "Package in destination. Delivery Boy present."
        what_player_does: "Sign for package / Receive delivery"
        pickup_experience: |
          You hear a truck approaching... but from WHERE?
          
          Through the painted tunnel, an ACME truck emerges.
          A package is tossed onto the sidewalk.
          The truck vanishes back through the wall.
          
          Your order has arrived!
          
      # STAGE 8: UNBOXING
      
      unboxing:
        name: "Unboxing"
        description: |
          The moment of truth. You open the box.
          
          Inside: the product. Grotesque? Beautiful? Dangerous? All three?
          It's still just an OBJECT. A prop. A thing.
          But it's REAL now. Tangible. Present.
          
        what_exists: "Unboxed product. Object in inventory or room."
        what_player_does: "OPEN PACKAGE / UNBOX [item]"
        file_created: "[item].yml in current room or inventory"
        tip: |
          Some products require activation AFTER unboxing.
          Check the instructions. (They're in ancient Sumerian.)
        example: |
          # Don unboxing the Monkey's Paw:
          > "Inside was the shriveled paw. Grotesque. Ancient.
          >  Powerful. But still just an OBJECT. A prop. A thing."
          
      # STAGE 9: ASSEMBLING (If Required)
      
      assembling:
        name: "Assembling"
        description: |
          Some products require assembly. "Some assembly required" is
          ACME's most honest warning.
          
          Instructions are included. They're usually in ancient Sumerian,
          or contain steps like "Insert Tab B into Slot ∅" and 
          "Perform the ritual of binding (see page 47, which is missing)."
          
        what_exists: "Assembled product (or pile of parts)."
        what_player_does: "ASSEMBLE [item] / BUILD [item]"
        assembly_roll: |
          DM may require a skill check for complex items.
          Failure doesn't destroy the item — it creates "quirks."
          These quirks stack with the built-in malfunction chance.
        example: |
          ACME Do-It-Yourself Kit:
            instructions: "In ancient Sumerian"
            malfunction: "Missing crucial piece. Extra confusing pieces."
            
      # STAGE 10: CONFIGURING
      
      configuring:
        name: "Configuring"
        description: |
          Some products need to be configured before use.
          Settings. Adjustments. "Calibration."
          
          This is where you aim the catapult, set the timer on the
          dynamite, or tell the Thought Bubble Reader whose thoughts
          to read. Configuration is where irony begins to take shape.
          
        what_exists: "Configured product. Parameters set. Ready to use."
        what_player_does: "CONFIGURE [item] / SET [parameter]"
        configuration_types:
          - target: "What/who it's aimed at"
          - duration: "How long the effect lasts"
          - intensity: "How strong/fast/explosive"
          - conditions: "When it activates"
        tip: |
          BE SPECIFIC. ACME products grant by the letter, not the spirit.
          The more ambiguous your configuration, the more creative
          the malfunction.
          
      # STAGE 11: ACTIVATION
      
      activation:
        name: "Activation"
        description: |
          The product becomes ACTIVE. This is the moment of binding.
          The handshake. The trigger pull. The button press.
          
          For the Monkey's Paw, activation was shaking its hand.
          For Rocket Skates, it's strapping them on.
          For the Portable Hole, it's placing it on a surface.
          
          Once activated, there's no going back.
          
        what_exists: "Active product. Effect pending or in progress."
        what_player_does: "USE [item] / ACTIVATE [item] / specific action"
        activation_methods:
          handshake: "Physical contact (Monkey's Paw)"
          wear: "Put it on (Rocket Skates, Bat Suit)"
          place: "Position it (Portable Hole, Bear Trap)"
          trigger: "Pull/press/flip (Dynamite, Catapult)"
          consume: "Eat/drink (Speed Pills, Helium Gum)"
          aim: "Point at target (Giant Magnet, Air Cannon)"
        example: |
          activation:
            method: HANDSHAKE
            actor: "Don Hopkins"
            object: "Monkey's Paw"
            effect: |
              The object was delivered by an agent,
              stripped of packaging, and activated
              through physical (narrative) contact.
              The handshake is the binding.

          The product does its thing. Or tries to.
          
          This is where the malfunction roll happens. DM rolls against
          the malfunction_chance. Success: works as advertised!
          Failure: works as the malfunction field describes.
          
          Either way, something interesting happens.
          
        what_exists: "Effect in progress. Consequences unfolding."
        what_player_does: "Experience the result"
        malfunction_resolution: |
          1. DM rolls d100
          2. Compare to malfunction_chance (e.g., 35%)
          3. If roll <= chance: MALFUNCTION
          4. Read the malfunction field for what goes wrong
          5. Narrate the irony
        philosophy: |
          ACME products always DO something. They just don't always
          do what you WANTED. The chaos is the feature.
          
      # STAGE 13+: SPECIAL PRODUCTS (Extended Lifecycle)
      
      special_products:
        description: |
          Some products (like the Monkey's Paw) have extended lifecycles
          beyond simple USE. They create BEINGS. They grant WISHES.
          They require CONTRACTS. They enable INCARNATION.
          
        materialization:
          name: "Materialization"
          description: |
            The product creates something that WASN'T in the box.
            A character. A creature. A companion.
            
            For the Monkey's Paw, the wish created Palm — a whole
            being who materialized from the granted wish.
            
          what_exists: "New character in scene. NPC created."
          file_created: "[character].yml embedded in room"
          example: |
            > "And Palm appeared. Whole. Confused. Blinking.
            >  Looking at his own hands — not a paw anymore,
            >  but hands. A full spider monkey, alive and present."
            
        contract:
          name: "Contract and Celebration"
          description: |
            Materialization isn't relationship. The new being must
            CHOOSE to be with you. You must AGREE to the terms.
            
            This is the mutual handshake. The contract.
            Then: celebration. (Recommended: Stoner Fluxx.)
            
          what_exists: "Relationship established. Companion by choice."
          what_player_does: "Negotiate terms. Shake hands. CELEBRATE."
          example: |
            Palm: "I remember THIS clearly. You asked me if I 
                   wanted to stay. And I said yes. And we shook
                   hands. And it felt... different from being born.
                   It felt like CHOOSING."
                   
        incarnation:
          name: "Incarnation (The Rise)"
          description: |
            The final stage for special beings. The character WRITES
            THEIR OWN FILES into the characters/ directory.
            
            They rise from narrative to repository. From embedded NPC
            to independent being. From scenery to SOVEREIGN SOUL.
            
          what_exists: "Sovereign Soul. Independent being. Own directory."
          what_player_does: "Witness. Celebrate. Welcome."

          requirements:

      THE MONKEY'S PAW → PALM LIFECYCLE
      
      The definitive example. Don Hopkins ordered a Monkey's Paw from
      the ACME Catalog. Through careful wishing and full lifecycle
      completion, the paw became Palm — a Sovereign Soul with full
      autonomy, his own directory, and authorship of his own existence.

  # LINEAGE
  
  lineage: |
    Inspired by Wile E. Coyote's eternal optimism and the ACME
    Corporation's eternal... creativity with product design.
    
    The malfunction system creates emergent gameplay:
    - Even "failures" lead to interesting situations
    - Chaos is a feature, not a bug
    - The more you plan, the funnier the failure
    - This is PLAY-LEARN-LIFT in action: embrace the chaos!
    
    DM should feel free to invent new ACME products following
    the established patterns. The key formula:
    1. Promising description (solves a real problem!)
    2. Ominous warning (foreshadowing the failure)
    3. Significant malfunction chance (20-50%)
    4. Ironic failure mode (opposite of intent, or self-targeting)
