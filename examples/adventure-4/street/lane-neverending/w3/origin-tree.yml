# The Origin Tree at 1 Lane Neverending

object:
  name: The Origin Tree
  type: landmark
  portable: false
  significance: sacred
  
  description: |
    An ancient oak of impossible age, standing at the western origin
    of Lane Neverending. Its trunk is massive, its branches spread
    wide, and its roots — they say — go down to the bare metal.

    THE ORIGIN TREE
    
    The oldest living thing on Lane Neverending. Possibly the oldest
    thing in this virtual world. Definitely older than it should be.
    
    TRUNK:
    Wide enough that three avatars holding hands couldn't encircle it.
    The bark is carved with initials, dates, and messages going back
    decades — in virtual time, that's generations.
    
    Some visible carvings:
    • "CM + RF '86" — Chip Morningstar & Randy Farmer, Habitat founders
    • "LK '95" — Someone named LK, early explorer
    • "GLITCH FOREVER 2012" — Players who didn't want to forget
    • Fresh carvings still being added...
    
    BRANCHES:
    Home to birds, squirrels, and the occasional cat. Fairy lights
    have been strung up, glowing softly in the evening. Someone hung
    a tire swing once; it's still there, swaying.
    
    ROOTS:
    They break through the cobblestones in places, reminding everyone
    that nature predates infrastructure. Stone circles and benches
    have been placed around the roots for sitting and contemplation.
    
    THE FEELING:
    Standing here, you feel... connected. To every avatar that walked
    before you. To every world that came and went. To the promise
    that virtual worlds matter, that community persists, that the
    lane never truly ends.

    CARVE:

      effect: |
        You carve your mark into the bark, joining the generations
        before you. Somewhere, a database entry is made. Your initials
        will remain as long as the world exists.
        
        "You were here. You mattered."
        
    SIT:

      effect: |
        The shade is cool. The roots make surprisingly comfortable
        seats. The bustle of the street fades. You feel at peace.
        
        This is a good place to think.
        
    TOUCH:
      description: "Place your hand on the trunk"
      effect: |
        The bark is rough and warm, as if the tree holds sunlight.
        
        For a moment, you feel connected to everyone who has stood
        here before. The founders. The pioneers. The players.
        
        The tree remembers them all.
