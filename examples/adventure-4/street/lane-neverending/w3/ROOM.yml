    You have reached 1 LANE NEVERENDING — the western origin point.
    The street begins here (or ends here, depending on your perspective).
    
    A small PLAZA opens up, centered on an ancient oak tree that
    somehow predates the virtual world it grows in. The ORIGIN TREE,
    they call it. Its roots go down to the bare metal.
    
    A bronze plaque at the base:
    
    ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

    THE ORIGIN TREE:
    An oak of impossible age. Its trunk is wide enough that three
    avatars holding hands couldn't encircle it. Initials are carved
    into the bark — the oldest ones in formats that predate Unicode.
    
    Beneath the tree: a stone circle, worn smooth. People gather
    here for important announcements, new year celebrations, and
    the occasional wedding. It's a place of beginnings.
    
    THE PLAZA:
    Cobblestones radiate outward from the tree in concentric circles.
    Benches face inward. A small fountain (working, unlike the one
    down the street) provides background music.
    
    1 LANE NEVERENDING:
    The first building. A small structure that's been many things:
    town hall, guild headquarters, museum, and now... empty, but
    maintained. Waiting for its next purpose.
    
    THE WESTERN EDGE:
    Beyond the plaza, paths lead in several directions, but they're
    overgrown. "FUTURE EXPANSION" signs mark the boundaries.
    The lane never ends, but this is where it starts.

        The plaza ends at a low wall overlooking... everything and nothing.
        The edge of the built world. Beyond here, only possibility.
        
        A sign: "THE LANE NEVER ENDS — IT JUST HASN'T BEEN BUILT YET"
        
        You could climb over, but there's nothing there. Yet.

    significance: |
      This is the navel of the world. The first coordinate.
      All addresses on Lane Neverending are measured from here.
      
      In Habitat, there was a center. In Glitch, there were
      starting streets. This is that tradition, made manifest.
