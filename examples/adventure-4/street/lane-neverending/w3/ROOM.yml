    You have reached 1 LANE NEVERENDING — the western origin point.
    The street begins here (or ends here, depending on your perspective).
    
    A small PLAZA opens up, centered on an ancient oak tree that
    somehow predates the virtual world it grows in. The ORIGIN TREE,
    they call it. Its roots go down to the bare metal.
    
    A bronze plaque at the base:

    THE ORIGIN TREE:
    An oak of impossible age. Its trunk is wide enough that three
    avatars holding hands couldn't encircle it. Initials are carved
    into the bark — the oldest ones in formats that predate Unicode.
    
    Beneath the tree: a stone circle, worn smooth. People gather
    here for important announcements, new year celebrations, and
    the occasional wedding. It's a place of beginnings.
    
    THE PLAZA:
    Cobblestones radiate outward from the tree in concentric circles.
    Benches face inward. A small fountain (working, unlike the one
    down the street) provides background music.
    
    1 LANE NEVERENDING:
    The first building. A small structure that's been many things:
    town hall, guild headquarters, museum, and now... empty, but
    maintained. Waiting for its next purpose.
    
    THE WESTERN EDGE:
    Beyond the plaza, paths lead in several directions, but they're
    overgrown. "FUTURE EXPANSION" signs mark the boundaries.
    The lane never ends, but this is where it starts.
    
  exits:
    east:

    west:
      to: ../e3/
      description: |
        The lane curves gently beyond the plaza... and continues. You
        walk west past the Origin Tree, but somehow the street numbers
        start climbing again. Construction scaffolding appears ahead.
        
        Wait. Weren't you just AT the beginning?
        
        The lane never ends. It loops. It always has.
        MOO HAA HAA.
      aliases: [w, continue, loop]
      
      # The secret
      loop_note: |
        You cannot leave Lane Neverending by walking.
        You can only leave by going NORTH (into buildings) or
        by accepting that the lane is your home now.

    significance: |
      This is the navel of the world. The first coordinate.
      All addresses on Lane Neverending are measured from here.
      
      In Habitat, there was a center. In Glitch, there were
      starting streets. This is that tradition, made manifest.
