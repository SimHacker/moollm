    Lane Neverending reaches its eastern extent — for now. The
    cobblestones give way to a dirt path that disappears into
    morning mist (or evening mist, or just regular mist).
    
    A wooden sign at the edge:
    
    ┌─────────────────────────────────┐
    │  LANE NEVERENDING CONTINUES    │
    │  (construction in progress)     │
    │  Please pardon our dust.        │
    │  — The Management               │
    └─────────────────────────────────┘
    
    The storefronts here are the newest, still smelling of fresh
    paint and possibility. The neighborhood is expanding.

    THE EDGE:
    Where the cobblestones end, a dirt path begins. Stakes with
    string mark where future streets will go. Someone has left
    surveying equipment. The world is being built.
    
    STOREFRONTS:
    • 18 Lane Neverending — Fresh paint, "OPENING SOON" (believable)
    • 20 Lane Neverending — Still under construction (sounds of hammering)
    • 22 Lane Neverending — Last building, optimistically numbered
    
    ATMOSPHERE:
    This is the frontier. The edge of the known world. Beyond here,
    the lane continues in theory, but not yet in practice. The
    builders are coming. The avatars will follow.
    
    It never ends. It just hasn't been built yet.

        The lane curves gently... and continues. You walk east, but
        somehow the street numbers start descending again. The Origin
        Tree comes into view ahead.
        
        Wait. Weren't you just heading AWAY from there?
        
        The lane never ends. It loops. It always has.
        MOO HAA HAA.

      # The secret
      loop_note: |
        Lane Neverending is a MÖBIUS STRIP of a street.
        Walk far enough in any direction, you end up where you started.
        The name was never a promise. It was a warning.
