# E3: Far East (The Loop Point)

> *"The end is just another beginning."*

**E3** is the easternmost segment of Lane Neverending — which means it connects directly to the westernmost segment. Walk east from here and you'll find yourself in W3. The loop completes.

## The Street

```mermaid

    E2["← e2"] --> E3["E3\nYou Are Here"]
    E3 --> |"THE LOOP!"| W3["w3 →\n(west side!)"]
    
    style E3 fill:#9b59b6,color:#fff
```

## The Loop

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    E3["E3 (here)"]
    
    E3 --> |"walk east"| Portal["The transition"]
    Portal --> |"seamlessly"| W3["W3 (far west)"]
    
    W3 --> |"keep walking east"| Eventually["...eventually..."]
    Eventually --> E3
```

There's no visible portal. No doorway. The street just... continues. East becomes west. West becomes east. Neverending.

## Landmarks

This segment is quieter than the center. A few discoveries await:

| The Last Lamp (East) | The easternmost lamp before the loop |
| A quiet bench | Good for contemplation |
| The continuation | Where east meets west |

## Philosophy of the Loop

Why does Lane Neverending loop?

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    Q["Why loop?"]
    
    Q --> A1["So nobody is ever\n'at the end'"]
    Q --> A2["So everywhere connects\nto everywhere"]
    Q --> A3["Because real communities\ndon't have edges"]
    Q --> A4["Because Game Neverending\nknew something we forgot"]
```
