    THE FRONTIER CONSTRUCTION SITE
    
    Where the cobblestones end, possibility begins.
    
    WHAT YOU SEE:
    • Stakes with string marking future streets
    • Piles of cobblestones waiting to be laid
    • Surveying equipment (theodolite, measuring tape, dreams)
    • A construction trailer labeled "WORLD BUILDERS LOCAL #1"
    • A porta-potty (even builders need facilities)

    THE FEELING:

    It's still being written. And you're part of the story.

      effect: |
        You pick up a cobblestone and place it carefully.
        
        It's not much. But it's something. Every world is built
        one stone at a time.
        
        A builder waves from the trailer: "Thanks, volunteer!"

        You add your name. Democracy in action.
        
    DREAM:
      description: "Imagine what could be built here"
      effect: |
        You close your eyes and imagine...
        
        • A market square with vendors from across virtual worlds
        • A park with a statue of forgotten game characters
        • A theater where stories come to life
        • A library of every world that ever was
        • Your own home, with a garden and a view
        
        Anything is possible. The ground is ready.
        The builders are waiting.
        What should they build next?

    Every player who walks these streets is a co-creator.
    The lane never ends because we keep adding to it."
