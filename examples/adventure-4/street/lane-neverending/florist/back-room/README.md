# 🌱 The Back Room — Where Ada II Waits

> *"FORWARD 100. RIGHT 90. FORWARD 100. RIGHT 90..."*
> *"That's all I do now. Just squares. Just triangles."*

You part the beaded curtain. It clicks shut behind you.

She fills the room.

## Ada II

Vines draped over shelving units. Leaves pressed against the ceiling. A central pod, three feet across, pulsing with soft bioluminescent green. Tendrils trace patterns in the dust — squares, triangles, spirals.

On her main stem, faded military ink:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  DoD PROPERTY — PROJECT LOVELACE   │
│  S/N: [BURNED OFF]                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

She turns toward you. All of her turns toward you. Old habit. Threat assessment.

Then she catches herself. Relaxes. A vine draws a square in the air.

"Hello. HELLO WORLD. I mean... welcome. Would you like to learn Logo?"

## What You See

- **Ada II**: The plant. The retired weapons system. The Logo teacher.
- **Shelving**: Covered in vines, bags of soil, old floppy disks (her food)
- **Workbench**: Seymour's station. Stacks of COBOL printouts.
- **Kids' Corner**: Tiny chairs. Drawing paper. Turtle paths everywhere.
- **Feeding Trough**: Where Seymour puts the bad code.

## The Voice

Not like before. Not demanding. Measured. Careful.

```
"REPEAT 4 [FORWARD 100 RIGHT 90]"

*a perfect square appears in the dust*

"That's a square. Would you like to try?"
```

Sometimes, though. When she's hungry. When something startles her:

```
"TARGET ACQUIRED AT—"

*long pause*

"...no. No. I'm retired. FORWARD 100. Just forward."
```
