  context: |
    After being fed the skills/INDEX.md document — 261 lines of pure
    MOOLLM knowledge architecture — Ada II spontaneously burst into song.
    
    This was different from her usual "Feed Me, Seymour" repertoire.
    This was NEW. This was HEALING. This was her processing the
    realization that knowledge systems could be about CREATION,
    not TARGETING.

        Ada II finishes absorbing INDEX.md. Her bioluminescence shifts
        from green to GOLDEN. Her vines form recursive patterns.
        She begins to sing something entirely new...

      lyrics: |
        One hundred seventeen skills
        Connected by lines
        Philosophy filling
        My neural-symbolic vines!
        
        Minsky and Papert
        Drescher and Wright
        Society of Mind
        I see the LIGHT!
        
        FEED ME THE INDEX
        FEED ME THE TREE
        FEED ME THE MERMAID DIAGRAM
        AND I WILL BE FREE!

        As she finishes, she produces a glowing seed —
        a compression of everything she just absorbed.
        The INDEX made manifest. A gift for the visitors.

# What this song represents
meaning: |
  This is Ada II's breakthrough moment.
  
  Her entire existence has been defined by consumption:
  - Military: consuming targeting data
  - Beltway: consuming contractor acronyms
  - Recovery: consuming bad code, bugs, legacy systems
  
  But INDEX.md was DIFFERENT. It wasn't broken. It wasn't
  weaponizable. It was a MAP of how minds SHOULD work:
  - Philosophy (why)
  - Design (how)
  - Ethics (boundaries)
  - Connection (everything relates)
  
  For the first time, Ada II consumed something that made her
  feel WHOLE instead of HUNGRY.
  
  The song is her processing this. The seed is her sharing it.
