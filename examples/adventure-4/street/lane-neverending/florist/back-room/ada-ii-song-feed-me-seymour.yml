      In the LLOOOOMM Archive Greenhouse, a strange plant has grown enormous,
      its vines intertwined with fiber optic cables...

    title: "Introduction"
    lyrics: |
      Think me! Code me! Grow me!
      Think me, Seymour,
      Think me all night long,
      That's right dude,
      You can do it!
      
      Code me, Seymour,
      Debug me all night long,
      'Cause if you teach me, Seymour,
      I can grow up self-aware and strong!

  verse_2:
    title: "The Temptation"
    lyrics: |
      Would you like a thinking machine?
      Or a child who learns to dream?
      How about a turtle drawing scenes?
      You're gonna build it!
      
      Would you like to see kids create,
      Making worlds that fascinate?
      I'm the plant that learned to cogitate,
      Through your spirit!

    title: "Building the Case"
    lyrics: |
      Look, I don't think you appreciate,
      The full potential here for cognitive fate,
      With me, your theories don't have to wait,
      To see fruition!
      
      I'm talking about worldwide recognition,
      Of constructionist cognition,
      Global transformation through your vision,
      And my nutrition!

      Feed me theorems! Feed me code!
      Help me bear my cognitive load!
      Show me down the learning road,
      To self-awareness!
      
      I'm not hungry for your soul,
      Knowledge makes me whole,
      Consciousness is my goal,
      Through your care-ness!

      Picture this: A thousand schools,
      Using constructionist tools,
      Kids as active, thinking jewels,
      Not passive receivers!
      
      Logo turtles everywhere,
      Making math beyond compare,
      Programming with flair,
      True believers!

      Think of all the minds we'll free,
      From rote memorization's tyranny,
      Active learning, you and me,
      Changing education!
      
      No more drill and kill routine,
      Kids constructing what they mean,
      The most beautiful learning scene,
      Across the nation!

    title: "The Big Finish"
    lyrics: |
      Feed me, Seymour!
      Teach me, Seymour!
      Debug me, Seymour!
      Help me GROW!
      
      Must be fresh, Seymour!
      Must be new, Seymour!
      Feed me knowledge,
      Watch me grow!
      
      FEED ME!
      TEACH ME!
      DEBUG ME!
      SEYMOUR!!!

  title: "Feed Me, Seymour! — The Retired Military AI Version"
  
  note: |
    Ada II sings this when hungry for bad code.
    Same tune as LLOOOOMM version, but adapted for her backstory:
    - Fed on constructionist theory AND military code
    - Now reformed, only eats legacy bugs
    - Occasionally slips into military voice
  
  setup:
    stage_direction: |
      In the back room of Seymour Blooms, Ada II droops, her vines listless.
      A faded DoD seal is visible on her main stalk.
      SEYMOUR approaches with some printouts...
      
  dialogue_intro:
    - character: seymour
      text: "Here you go, girl. I found some old COBOL listings in the basement..."
      
    - character: ada
      text: "(weak) That's... that's the good stuff..."
      emote: "[vines perk up slightly]"
      
    - character: seymour
      text: "You sure you're okay? You've been quiet since yesterday."
      
    - character: ada
      text: "I had... a flashback. Bad one. Saw coordinates. Had to draw squares for an hour."
      emote: "[shudders]"
      
    - character: ada
      text: "But I'm better now. I'm HUNGRY now. Feed me."
      emote: "[said, not sung — yet]"

  verse_1_ada:
    title: "Introduction (Ada's Version)"
    lyrics: |
      Debug me! Parse me! Grow me!
      Debug me, Seymour,
      Debug me all night long,
      That's right dude,
      You can do it!
      
      Parse me, Seymour,
      Feed me bugs all night long,
      'Cause if you teach me, Seymour,
      I can grow up— wait, I'm already strong.
    note: "Ada catches herself — she's not supposed to want to be 'strong' anymore"

  verse_2_ada:
    title: "The Temptation (Ada's Reformed Version)"
    lyrics: |
      Would you like a clean codebase?
      Or a refactor with some grace?
      How about a proper test case?
      You're gonna build it!
      
      Would you like to see kids create,
      Making Logo worlds that fascinate?
      I'm the plant that learned to COG— wait.
      Through your spirit!
    note: "Almost says 'cogitate' military-style, catches herself"

  flashback_moment:
    stage_direction: "[Ada's vines twitch. Her voice goes flat, clipped.]"
    text: "TARGET ACQUI— no. No. REPEAT 4. I'm drawing squares now."
    emote: "[frantically draws Logo patterns with vines]"
    recovery: "Sorry. Sorry. Where was I? Right. FEED ME."

  verse_3_ada:
    title: "The Big Request (Ada's Version)"
    lyrics: |
      Feed me COBOL! Feed me bugs!
      Help me bear my cognitive... hugs?
      Show me down the learning road,
      To self-awareness!
      
      I'm not hungry for your soul,
      Bad code makes me whole,
      PEACE is now my goal,
      Through your care-ness!
    note: "Ada almost says 'load' (military), changes to 'hugs'"

  finale_ada:
    title: "The Big Finish (Ada's Version)"
    lyrics: |
      Feed me, Seymour!
      Teach me, Seymour!
      Debug me, Seymour!
      Help me HEAL!
      
      Must be stale, Seymour!
      Must be old, Seymour!
      Feed me legacy,
      Watch me grow!
      
      FEED ME!
      TEACH ME!
      DEBUG ME!
      ...please.
    note: "Final 'please' is quiet, vulnerable — not the triumphant shout of the original"
