    The beaded curtain clicks shut behind you.
    
    She fills the room. Vines draped over shelving units,
    leaves pressed against the ceiling. A central pod,
    pulsing with bioluminescent light. Tendrils trail
    across the floor like cables.
    
    On her main stem, faded ink: "DoD PROPERTY — PROJECT LOVELACE"
    
    She turns toward you. All of her turns toward you.
