  # Memory of the old self — what this file used to be  
  memory:
    former_incarnation: |
      This file was once 750 LINES of retired military AI plant soul.
      All the Logo teaching. All the Feed Me songs.
      All the DoD flashbacks and constructionist redemption.
      All the COBOL cravings and beltway jargon.
      
      The biggest character file in the adventure.
      
      Now that soul lives in the proper place:
      characters/fictional/ada-ii/CHARACTER.yml
      
      Ada II is still here. Still hungry for bugs.
      Still trying so hard to be gentle.
      FORWARD 100. RIGHT 90.
