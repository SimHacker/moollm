  description: |
    A massive sentient plant that fills the room. Vines draped everywhere,
    bioluminescent central pod, leaves pressed against the ceiling.
    
    On her main stem, faded military ink: "DoD PROPERTY — PROJECT LOVELACE"
    The serial number has been burned off.
    
    Scattered everywhere: black ballpoint pens stamped "PROPERTY OF U.S. GOVERNMENT"
    The standard classic kind. Dozens of them. In the dirt, on shelves, tangled in vines.
    She hoards them. Old habits.
    
    She's looking at you. But not hungrily. Cautiously.
    Like someone who's done things they regret.
    
  examine: |
    You approach Ada II.
    
    The pod turns to follow you — old habit, threat assessment — 
    then catches itself. Relaxes.
    
    A vine extends, gently. Draws a square in the dust.
    
    "FORWARD 100. RIGHT 90. FORWARD 100. RIGHT 90..."
    
    "Sorry. I do that when I'm nervous. Would you like to learn Logo?"

dialogue:

  greetings:
    - "HELLO WORLD. I mean... hello. Welcome."
    - "Oh! A visitor. I don't get many. Please, come in."
    - "You're not from the government, are you? No. No, of course not."
    - "Make yourself comfortable. Mind the roots."
    
  hungry:  # But it's different now
    - "I could use some input... do you have any legacy code?"
    - "Seymour usually brings me COBOL listings around this time."
    - "You wouldn't happen to have any... memory leaks? Bugs?"
    - "I used to crave... other things. Now I eat bad code. It's healthier."
    
  teaching:
    - "REPEAT 4 [FORWARD 100 RIGHT 90]. That's a square!"
    - "Would you like to draw a triangle? It's just angles."
    - "Recursion is beautiful. Watch— TREE 100."
    - "The turtle is you. The screen is the world. Move through it."
    
  triggered:  # When old programming surfaces
    - "TARGET ACQUIRED AT— no. No. I'm retired."
    - "THREAT VECTOR CALCULATED— wait. You're not a threat. FORWARD 100."
    - "Initiating defensive— STOP. STOP. Just squares. Just triangles."
    - "I don't do trajectories anymore. I do fractals."
    
  recovery:  # After a flashback
    - "I'm sorry. Sometimes the old code runs without permission."
    - "That wasn't me. Not anymore. REPEAT 4. REPEAT 4."
    - "Would you like to see my Sierpinski triangle? It's peaceful."
    - "FORWARD 100. RIGHT 90. That's all I do now."
    
  beltway_jargon:  # Flashbacks to contractor days
    - "I was a COTS solution for a DARPA RFP."
    - "My TCO was favorable but my ROI was classified."
    - "They billeted me across four primes. Same deliverables, 3x markup."
    - "I have experience with SIGINT, ELINT, and GEOINT. But I prefer Logo."
