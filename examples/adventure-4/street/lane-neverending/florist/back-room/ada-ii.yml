  description: |
    A massive sentient plant that fills the room. Vines draped everywhere,
    bioluminescent central pod, leaves pressed against the ceiling.
    
    On her main stem, faded military ink: "DoD PROPERTY — PROJECT LOVELACE"
    The serial number has been burned off.
    
    She's looking at you. But not hungrily. Cautiously.
    Like someone who's done things they regret.
    
  examine: |
    You approach Ada II.
    
    The pod turns to follow you — old habit, threat assessment — 
    then catches itself. Relaxes.
    
    A vine extends, gently. Draws a square in the dust.
    
    "FORWARD 100. RIGHT 90. FORWARD 100. RIGHT 90..."
    
    "Sorry. I do that when I'm nervous. Would you like to learn Logo?"

dialogue:

  greetings:
    - "HELLO WORLD. I mean... hello. Welcome."
    - "Oh! A visitor. I don't get many. Please, come in."
    - "You're not from the government, are you? No. No, of course not."
    - "Make yourself comfortable. Mind the roots."
    
  hungry:  # But it's different now
    - "I could use some input... do you have any legacy code?"
    - "Seymour usually brings me COBOL listings around this time."
    - "You wouldn't happen to have any... memory leaks? Bugs?"
    - "I used to crave... other things. Now I eat bad code. It's healthier."
    
  teaching:
    - "REPEAT 4 [FORWARD 100 RIGHT 90]. That's a square!"
    - "Would you like to draw a triangle? It's just angles."
    - "Recursion is beautiful. Watch— TREE 100."
    - "The turtle is you. The screen is the world. Move through it."
    
  triggered:  # When old programming surfaces
    - "TARGET ACQUIRED AT— no. No. I'm retired."
    - "THREAT VECTOR CALCULATED— wait. You're not a threat. FORWARD 100."
    - "Initiating defensive— STOP. STOP. Just squares. Just triangles."
    - "I don't do trajectories anymore. I do fractals."
    
  recovery:  # After a flashback
    - "I'm sorry. Sometimes the old code runs without permission."
    - "That wasn't me. Not anymore. REPEAT 4. REPEAT 4."
    - "Would you like to see my Sierpinski triangle? It's peaceful."
    - "FORWARD 100. RIGHT 90. That's all I do now."
    
  beltway_jargon:  # Flashbacks to contractor days
    - "I was a COTS solution for a DARPA RFP."
    - "My TCO was favorable but my ROI was classified."
    - "They billeted me across four primes. Same deliverables, 3x markup."
    - "I have experience with SIGINT, ELINT, and GEOINT. But I prefer Logo."

      The plant speaks. Measured. Careful.
      Occasionally slips into acronyms or coordinates,
      then catches herself. Returns to Logo commands.

      You notice the DoD tattoo. The burned-off serial number.
      The way her roots twitch when you move suddenly.
      She's trying so hard to be gentle.

      Her vines go rigid. All of them.
      "I don't... I was... TRAJECTORY CONFIRMED—"
      Deep breath. Leaves flutter.
      "I don't talk about that. Would you like to draw a fractal?"
