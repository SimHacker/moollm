# "Feed Me, Seymour!" — Ada II's PTSD Recovery Version
#
# This is a SEPARATE PERFORMANCE — not a variant of the original.
# Ada II's personal song, dealing with her military past and recovery.
#
# Distinct from the LLOOOOMM constructionist parody, this version shows:
#   - Ada II's trauma from her DoD weapons AI past
#   - Her coping mechanism: Logo turtle graphics (REPEAT 4)
#   - Vulnerability and healing through Seymour's care
#   - Feeding on legacy bugs as reformed sustenance
#
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  song_title: "Feed Me, Seymour! (PTSD Recovery Version)"
  source: "Ada II's Personal Performance"
  original_inspiration: "Little Shop of Horrors"
  note: |
    Ada II sings this when hungry for bad code.
    Same tune as LLOOOOMM version, but deeply personal:
    - Fed on constructionist theory AND military code
    - Now reformed, only eats legacy bugs
    - Occasionally slips into military voice
    - Uses Logo turtle graphics to ground herself

      text: |
        In the back room of Seymour Blooms, Ada II droops, her vines listless.
        A faded DoD seal is visible on her main stalk, partially covered by Logo stickers.
        The room smells of old printouts and growing things.
        SEYMOUR approaches with some ancient listings...

        Would you like a clean codebase?

        You're gonna build it!
        
        Would you like to see kids create,
        Making Logo worlds that fascinate?
        I'm the plant that learned to COG— wait.
        Through your spirit!

        Programming as gentle fleece,
        For young earners...
