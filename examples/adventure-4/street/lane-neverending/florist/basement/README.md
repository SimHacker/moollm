# 🌿 Florist Basement — PROJECT LOVELACE

> Cold storage. Old records. Darker secrets.

Concrete stairs descend into darkness. Preservation cold. Filing cabinets, military gray. A faded sign on the wall: "PROJECT LOVELACE — CLASSIFIED."

Ada II's roots have crept down here — but these roots are different. Older. Harder. The parts of her she tried to prune away. They twitch when you move too fast. They track you.

An old server rack still runs backup processes from a time nobody talks about.

## Exits

- **Up** → [Florist shop](../) — back to the light
- **Hatch** → [Back room](../back-room/) — trap door up

## Objects

- Filing cabinets — locked (contain PROJECT LOVELACE files, target lists, mission logs)
- Old server rack — still running
- Cold storage unit — Seymour has the only key
- Root mass — Ada II's old operational roots

## NPCs

- [Ada II](../../../../characters/fictional/ada-ii/) — voice from upstairs, reacts if you touch the files

## Triggers

- Stay too long: roots twitch
- Touch the files: Ada II's defensive response from above
- "TRAJECTORY CONFIRMED—" (flashback risk: HIGH)
