    Concrete stairs descend into darkness.
    
    The air is cold. Preservation cold. The hum of old
    cooling systems. Rows of filing cabinets, military gray.
    
    Ada II's roots have crept down here too. But these
    roots are different. Older. Harder. The parts of her
    she tried to prune away.
    
    On the wall, a faded sign: "PROJECT LOVELACE — CLASSIFIED"

atmosphere:
  lighting: "Flickering fluorescent, emergency red"
  sound: "Cooling systems. Data drives. Whispered coordinates."
  smell: "Cold metal, old paper, something chemical"
  temperature: "Cold. Deliberately cold."

      Ada II's roots extend here. But these are different.
      Darker. Thicker. The roots she grew when she was
      still... operational.
      
      They twitch sometimes. Tracking movements.

  - id: the_cold_storage
    hint: "The refrigeration unit is always running."
    reveal: "Some things can't be deleted. Only preserved."
    
  - id: the_humming
    hint: "The old server still runs backup processes."
    reveal: "Part of Ada II is still down here. The part she can't shut off."

# DO NOT stay too long

      The roots twitch. Following your movement.
      
      From upstairs, Ada II's voice, strained:
      "Please come back up. I don't like when people
       are down there. Those files are... old.
       
       FORWARD 100. RIGHT 90. Please come up."
       
  - trigger: "touching the files"
    effect: |
      The roots go rigid. All of them.
      
      *"PERIMETER BREACH. TARGET ACQUI—"*
      
      Then, from upstairs, a strangled:
      *"NO. NO. They're just looking. Just curious.
       REPEAT 4. REPEAT 4. REPEAT 4.
       I'm retired. I grow flowers."*
      
      The roots relax. Slowly.
