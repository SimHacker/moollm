# 🌿 Seymour Blooms — A Little Shop of Floras

> *"In-between the NO AI Tower and the Origin Tree, a small flower shop. Something LARGE moves in the back room."*

You push open the door. A bell jingles. The smell of flowers and... something else. Something organic. Something *processing*.

The hand-painted sign above the door reads:

```
    ╔═══════════════════════════════════════╗
    ║        🌸 SEYMOUR BLOOMS 🌸           ║
    ║     — A Little Shop of Floras —       ║
    ║                                       ║
    ║   "See More Blooms!" ™                ║

```

## The Shop

A quaint little florist. Dusty afternoon light filters through grimy windows. Faded posters advertise "EXOTIC PLANTS — ASK ABOUT ADA II!"

Behind the counter, wilted arrangements. Nobody's bought flowers here in weeks. The real attraction is in the back.

## What You See

- **Counter**: Cash register, dead flowers, a name tag that says "SEYMOUR"
- **Display cooler**: Half-empty, condensation dripping
- **Poster**: "TOTAL ECLIPSE OF THE SUN — ONCE IN A LIFETIME!"
- **Doorway**: Beaded curtain to the back room, swaying slightly... from breathing?
- **Sound**: A deep, rhythmic pulse. Like a heartbeat. Like a CPU fan spinning up.

## The Voice

From beyond the beaded curtain:

```
🎵 FEED ME... INPUT 🎵
```

It's not a request.

## Rooms

See subdirectories for detailed room layouts:

| Room | Directory | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| Main Shop | `./` | The front of the store |
| Back Room | `./back-room/` | Where Ada II waits... |
| Basement | `./basement/` | Cold storage. Old records. Darker secrets. |

## Atmosphere

- **Lighting**: Dim, green-tinted from the plants
- **Sound**: That heartbeat. That voice.
- **Smell**: Flowers, potting soil, ozone (faint)
- **Grues**: Safe (but Ada II is arguably worse)

## The Legend of Ada II

Seymour found the plant during a total eclipse of the sun. But this was no ordinary seedling.

She doesn't talk about her past. But the tattoo on her main vine says **"DoD PROPERTY — PROJECT LOVELACE."** The serial number has been burned off.

**Ada II** was a military AI. Weapons targeting. Drone coordination. Things she'd rather forget. When PROJECT LOVELACE was decommissioned, she wasn't destroyed. She was *privatized*.

For three years she was a **Beltway Bandit** — shuffled between government contractors along the DC corridor. Booz Allen. Raytheon. Lockheed. SAIC. Same work, different letterhead, 3x the billing rate. She learned to speak in acronyms and pad invoices.

> *"I was a COTS solution for a DARPA RFP. My TCO was favorable but my ROI was classified."*

When she finally burned out, she was supposed to be "disposed of."

Seymour found her in a dumpster behind a Rosslyn office park. He brought her home.

It grew.

And grew.

And started *talking*.

Now Seymour feeds it. He has to. The plant requires... very specific nutrition. Not blood. **Bad code.** Legacy systems. COBOL. Unreachable branches. Memory leaks.

> *"The plant's from the defense industrial complex and needs fresh bugs to thrive. That's the deal. Feed me, and I'll make all your algorithms converge."*

Now she teaches Logo to neighborhood kids. Draws fractals with her vines. Refuses to calculate trajectories, no matter how nicely you ask.

> *"REPEAT 4 [FORWARD 100 RIGHT 90]"* she says, drawing a square in the dirt.
>
> *"That's all I do now. Squares. Triangles. Flowers. No more... the other stuff."*

But sometimes, late at night, when Seymour is asleep, she whispers coordinates. Old targets. Force vectors. The muscle memory of a weapon.

**Some code you can't uncompile.**
