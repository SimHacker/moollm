  description: |
    Lane Neverending continues east. The cobblestones here are slightly
    newer — this section was repaved after the Great Pixel Flood of '09.
    
    STOREFRONTS line both sides, but their doors are boarded up or
    display "COMING SOON" signs in various states of optimism. The
    buildings are ready. The tenants are not.
    
    To the WEST, The Rusty Lantern's sign is still visible, swaying
    gently. To the EAST, the street continues toward... somewhere.
    
    A lamp post flickers. A cat watches from a windowsill.
    
  examine: |
    NORTH SIDE (even numbers):
    • 8 Lane Neverending — Empty storefront, "FOR LEASE" sign
    • 10 Lane Neverending — Boarded up, graffiti reads "SOON"
    
    SOUTH SIDE (odd numbers):
    • 9 Lane Neverending — Windows papered over, sounds of construction?
    • 11 Lane Neverending — A door, but it leads to a brick wall (art piece?)
    
    The street furniture:
    • Two benches (one occupied by a sleeping figure)
    • A lamp post (the flickering one)
    • A fire hydrant (or the local equivalent)
    • An empty notice board
