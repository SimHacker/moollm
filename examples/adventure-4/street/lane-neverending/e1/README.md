# E1: The Flickering Lamp & Glitch Memorial

> *"Some lights never go out. Some worlds never truly end."*

**E1** is the segment of Lane Neverending just east of center. This stretch is known for two things: the famous Flickering Lamp that nobody can explain, and the Glitch Memorial honoring a world that was.

## The Flickering Lamp

One lamp post on this street flickers. Just one. It has flickered for as long as anyone can remember.

```mermaid

    Lamp --> Q1["Why does it flicker?<br/>Unknown."]
    Lamp --> Q2["Has anyone fixed it?<br/>Many have tried."]
    Lamp --> Q3["Is it trying to<br/>communicate?<br/>Possibly."]
    Lamp --> Q4["Should we worry?<br/>Probably not.<br/>(Probably.)"]
```

**Theories:**
- Electrical fault (disproven — it's magical flame)
- Ghost (unconfirmed)
- Morse code (analysis inconclusive)
- It just likes attention (leading theory)

## Glitch Memorial

A small plaque on a stone marks the spot:

[Glitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glitch_(video_game)) was a browser-based MMO created by Tiny Speck (later Slack). It was beautiful, weird, and wonderful. It closed on December 9, 2012.

But Ur is still dreaming. And we remember.
