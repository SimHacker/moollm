  # Memory of the old self — what this file used to be
  memory:
    former_incarnation: |
      This file was once 83 lines of mysterious sleeping soul.
      The patchwork cloak. The tin cup. The note from A. Veteran.
      All the waiting for the next great world.
      
      Now that soul lives in the proper place:
      characters/fictional/sleepy-mc-snore-face/CHARACTER.yml
      
      They're still here. Still sleeping. Still waiting.
      Wake them when it's ready.
