    THE SLEEPING FIGURE
    
    Wrapped in a cloak made of patches from a hundred different
    virtual worlds — you recognize fabric from Habitat, Glitch,
    Second Life, and places you can't name.
    
    Their face is obscured. Their breathing is slow and steady.
    Too steady. Suspiciously steady.
    
    A cardboard sign leans against the bench:
    
    ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
    │  WAITING FOR THE NEXT WORLD         │
    │                                     │
    │  (Please do not wake)               │
    │  (I'll know when it's time)         │
    │                                     │
    │  Tips appreciated but not expected. │
    └─────────────────────────────────────┘
    
    A tin cup sits nearby, containing:
    • A few coins from currencies that no longer exist
    • A button that says "I ♥ UR"
    • A folded note
    
    THE NOTE (if you read it):
    "I was there when Habitat opened. I was there when Glitch closed.
    I'll be there when the next great world begins. Wake me then."

    WAKE:
      description: "Try to wake the figure"
      effect: |
        You reach out...
        
        The figure shifts slightly. Mumbles something that sounds
        like "not yet... still dreaming..."
        
        They don't wake. They're waiting for something specific.
        Something that hasn't happened yet.
        
    TIP:

      effect: |
        You add your offering to the cup.
        
        The figure doesn't stir, but you could swear the corner
        of their mouth twitches upward. Just slightly.
        
        "Thanks," they murmur, still asleep. "See you in the next one."

        The note is old, written in careful handwriting:
        
        "I was there when Habitat opened. I was there when Glitch
        closed. I'll be there when the next great world begins.
        
        Wake me then.

  secret:
    identity: |
      The sleeping figure is one of the original Habitat beta testers.
      They've been "sleeping" across virtual worlds for decades,
      waking only when something truly new begins.
      
      They'll wake for MOOLLM. Eventually. When it's ready.
