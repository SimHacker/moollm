    THE FLICKERING LAMP POST
    
    One of the older lamp posts on Lane Neverending. The magical
    flame inside sputters and dances unpredictably:
    
    *flicker* ... *flicker flicker* ... *steady* ... *FLICKER*
    
    A work order is nailed to the post:

    LOCAL LEGEND:
    They say the lamp flickers in patterns. Some claim it's 
    morse code. Others say it predicts the weather. A few
    insist it's trying to communicate.
    
    Nobody has cracked the code yet.
    (There might not be one.)
    (But what if there is?)

        You watch carefully...
        
        *flicker* ... *flicker* ... *steady* ... *BRIGHT* ... *dim*
        
        Is that... S.O.S.? No, wait. It's just random.
        
        Or IS it?
        
        (It's random. Probably. Maybe.)
        
    TAP:

      effect: |
        *CLANG*
        
        The flame steadies for a moment, burns bright...
        
        ...then goes back to flickering. Some things can't be fixed.
        Some things don't want to be.
        
  secret:
    the_truth: |
      The lamp IS trying to communicate. It's the ghost of an old
      street light from Habitat, still running its original code.
      
      It's saying: "HELLO WORLD HELLO WORLD HELLO WORLD"
      
      Forever.
