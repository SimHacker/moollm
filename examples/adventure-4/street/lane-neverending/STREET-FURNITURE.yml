      A classic wrought-iron lamp post with a magical flame.
      One stands on every block of Lane Neverending, casting
      warm light that keeps the grues at bay.

      LANE NEVERENDING LAMP POST
      
      Wrought-iron, ornate, timeless design.
      The style hasn't changed since the first virtual streets.
      
      THE LAMP:
      A magical flame burns steadily inside a glass housing.
      No fuel, no smoke, no maintenance (mostly).
      The light is warm, golden, welcoming.
      
      THE POST:
      Decorative ironwork with the Lane Neverending crest.
      A small plaque at the base: "Donated by the Virtual
      Preservation Society. May this light never go out."
      
      At night, the lamps create pools of safety.
      Grues cannot abide the light.
      Avatars gather beneath them.

      Herringbone pattern, gray granite.
      Each stone has been here since... always?
      
      Some stones are worn deeper than others.
      Grooves from cart wheels. Divots from boots.
      The street remembers every journey.
      
      Between the stones: weeds, sometimes flowers.
      Life finds a way in the cracks.
      
    properties:
      traversable: true
      pattern: herringbone
      material: granite

      Stone gutters line the edges of the street,
      channeling rainwater toward mysterious drains.
      
    examine: |
      The gutter runs along the street edge.
      Water trickles toward iron grates.
      Where does it go? Nobody knows.
      (Actually, the sewers. But that's less mysterious.)
