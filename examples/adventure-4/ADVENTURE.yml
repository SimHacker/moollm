    # How to format debug sections (natural language instructions):
    format: |
      Wrap technical details in <details> tags with descriptive <summary>.
      Summary should explain the action: "Editing CHARACTER.yml to move 
      player from start/ to coatroom/" — not just "File edit".
      Include relative markdown links: [CHARACTER.yml](./CHARACTER.yml).
      YAML should be abbreviated with # comments on key fields.
      Explain the WHY: why this file, why this field, how MOOLLM works.

  # The World Tour concept

    spirit: |
      The dogs will sniff and mark.
      The cats will investigate and claim.
      The monkey will observe and occasionally offer wisdom.
      Nature takes its course — emergent behavior, file marking, territory claiming.
      Don Hopkins leads and narrates the journey.
