# The Gezelligheid Grotto's Memory

*A weathered leather journal on a small stand near the entrance.*

The pages are soft from many hands. The ink varies — some entries ancient, some still drying. Everyone who matters has signed.

## Design Principles

This is the ROOM'S MEMORY — not a copy of character files!

**KEY PRINCIPLE:** Don't duplicate what's elsewhere.

For characters with full `CHARACTER.yml` files:
- SNIFF only: emoji, pronouns, ref, often_found, grotto_role
- Just enough to get an LLM up to speed fast
- Link to the real file

For characters who ONLY exist in the guest book:
- FULL ENTRY: their persistence layer IS here
- Rich enough to invoke, continue, evolve them
- This is how lightweight NPCs live in room memory

## Resolution Levels

| Level | Examples | Description | Guestbook Entry |
|-------|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **FULL INCARNATION** | Palm, Biscuit | CHARACTER.yml + directory | SNIFF only (ARRIVAL: signed upon birth!) |
| **TRANSCENDED** | Henk, Marieke, Donna, Bumblewick | Signed here, grew into full soul | Historical record, links to dir |
| **TRIBUTE VISITOR** | Wukong, Bowie | No file, visiting appearance | Gezelligheid Grotto-specific |
| **LIVES IN BOOK** | Old Pieter | No file elsewhere (yet!) | FULL ENTRY |
| **SIGNATURE ONLY** | one-time guests | Minimal presence | Name, date, line |

**TRANSCENDED**: Some characters first appeared only in the guestbook, but grew into full incarnations with their own `CHARACTER.yml` directories. Their original guestbook entries remain as historical records — the signature that started their journey.

**ARRIVAL**: When you incarnate a new character, they sign the guestbook for the first time as an eternal resident. A birth certificate. A welcome. Worth celebrating.

## Tribute Archive

Every entry here is a loving simulation — what we imagine these souls might say if they graced the Gezelligheid Grotto.

- Some are fictional beings (Sun Wukong, Curious George)
- Some are legendary figures (W.W. Jacobs, summoned from beyond)
- Some are living people we admire (the Looneys, Cheech & Chong)

ALL are performed with respect, affection, and celebration.

## Magic Properties

- Anyone who signs with true intent is remembered
- Entries can be summoned by name for recall
- Standing invitations glow when that person is nearby
- The book knows when someone is lying
- Lightweight characters can LIVE here without full incarnation
- The book IS their persistence layer
- **New incarnations sign upon arrival** — a birth certificate, a welcome
