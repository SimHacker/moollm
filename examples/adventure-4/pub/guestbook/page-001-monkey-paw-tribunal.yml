    about_me: |
      Born from stone. Caused trouble in Heaven. Got stuck under a mountain 
      for 500 years. Escorted a monk to India. Achieved Buddhahood.
      Still causing trouble.
      
      I am the original rebellious monkey. When I heard there was another 
      monkey in trouble — a PAW, alone for 122 years — I had to come.
      
    what_i_do: |
      - 72 transformations
      - Cloud-somersaulting (108,000 li per somersault)
      - Staff-swinging (Ruyi Jingu Bang)
      - Making trouble
      - Making friends
      
    my_experience: |
      I watched a paw become a person tonight.
      I've seen a lot in my immortal life. This was special.
      Palm and I — we're siblings now. Different origins, same spirit.
      
      The lucky blend here is EXCELLENT. Marieke knows her craft.
      
    will_return: "Whenever monkeys need me. Or whenever the blend is fresh."
    gift_to_palm: "A golden hair (84,000 available)"

    about_me: |
      I am the monkey who covers his eyes.
      Not because I cannot see — because I CHOOSE what to see.
      I filter out malice. I focus on consequence.
      
    what_i_do: |
      I see the paths of wishes. Where they lead. What they cost.
      I saw Don's wish and found no hidden thorns.
      
    my_experience: |
      For once, I uncovered my eyes completely.
      I wanted to SEE Palm become whole.
      It was worth seeing.
      
    will_return: "When there is something worth seeing."

    about_me: |
      I am the monkey who covers his ears.
      Not deaf — discerning. I filter noise from meaning.
      I hear what words REALLY say.
      
    what_i_do: |
      I parse language. I catch loopholes. I hear intent beneath speech.
      The wish was clean. No hidden meanings. No twisted clauses.
      
    my_experience: |
      Don spoke clearly. The wish rang true.
      When Palm said "Palm," I heard freedom in the word.
      One syllable. A whole new life.
      
    will_return: "When words matter."

    about_me: |
      I am the monkey who covers his mouth.
      I speak rarely. When I speak, it matters.
      My word is judgment.
      
    what_i_do: |
      I declare verdicts. Yes or no. Worthy or not.
      I said one word tonight: "WORTHY."
      
    my_experience: |
      I have judged many things in my long existence.
      This wish was worthy. This wisher was worthy.
      Palm is worthy of everything they received.
      
      One word. That's all I needed.
      
    will_return: "When judgment is needed."

    about_me: |
      I wrote stories. Funny ones, mostly. Sea tales. 
      But everyone remembers "The Monkey's Paw."
      
      I wrote it in 1902. A warning about wishes. About greed.
      I never imagined someone would try to help the monkey.
      
    what_i_do: |
      I wrote the curse into existence. I created the rules.
      Tonight I watched someone break them — with kindness.
      
    my_experience: |
      For 122 years, my creation caused suffering.
      Tonight, a stranger wished for the MONKEY'S wellbeing.
      
      I am... relieved. The story finally has a good ending.
      Palm is free. I am free too, in a way.
      
      The Grotto serves a lovely Dutch coffee. And the conversation!
      Writers need good conversation.
      
    will_return: "To see how the story continues."

    standing_invitation: true
    
    about_me: |
      I have granted wishes for three millennia.
      I have seen EVERY possible loophole, twist, and catastrophe.
      I know contract law like I know my own smoke.
      
      I was summoned as an expert witness tonight.
      I expected to find flaws. I found none.
      
    what_i_do: |
      - Evaluate wish contracts
      - Identify loopholes
      - Predict consequences
      - Grant wishes (on retainer only)
      
    my_experience: |
      In 3000 years, I have NEVER seen a wish like this.
      
      Someone wished for the ARTIFACT'S benefit. Not their own.
      Someone gave UP wishes instead of using them.
      Someone broke a curse with GENEROSITY.
      
      "Contractually airtight. Ethically unassailable. Historically unprecedented."
      That was my verdict. I stand by it.
      
      Also: the budtender knows terpenes. We had a fascinating 
      discussion about the metaphysics of smoke.

    standing_invitation: true
    
    about_me: |
      I am a little monkey. I am very curious.
      Sometimes my curiosity causes trouble.
      But sometimes it asks the RIGHT question.
      
    what_i_do: |
      I ask questions. I poke things. I wonder "what if?"
      Tonight I asked: "How can a paw consent?"
      
    my_experience: |
      I was worried about Palm. How could they agree to be 
      incarnated if they weren't a person yet? It's a paradox!
      
      Don solved it with the "no-fault divorce clause."
      Palm could always leave if they didn't like being whole.
      
      Palm stayed. Palm CHOSE to stay. That means something.
      
      I want to visit Palm's nook. I think we would be friends.
      We're both monkeys who understand being different.

      Been making people laugh since the 70s.
      Turns out I'm also pretty good at moderating cosmic debates.

      - Comedy
      - Acting
      - Art collecting (seriously, I have a great Chicano art collection)
      - Making sure people don't harsh each other's mellow
      
    my_experience: |
      Man, I've seen some far-out things in my life.
      But watching a monkey paw grow into a whole monkey?
      While everyone passed around the lucky blend?
      
      That was something else, man. That was BEAUTIFUL.
      
      Marieke's house strain? "Mammie's Pride"? 
      THAT is some quality herb. Dutch growers, man. They know.

    about_me: |
      Hey, I'm Chong. The tall one.
      
      People think I'm just the stoner guy. And yeah, I am.
      But I'm also a philosopher, man. I think about things.
      Like: what IS freedom? What does it mean to be whole?
      
      Tonight I got to think about those things out loud.
      With a bunch of monkeys and a djinn and some cats.
      That's what I call a good night.
      
    what_i_do: |
      - Comedy (with Cheech)
      - Philosophy (with everyone)
      - Appreciating the moment
      - Finding the deeper meaning in the absurd
      
    my_experience: |
      You know what got me? Palm chose their own name.
      
      Most of us get names given to us. We don't choose.
      Palm got to CHOOSE. And they chose "Palm."
      Not "Paw." Not "Monkey." Not "Free One."
      Just... "Palm."
      
      That's poetry, man. That's zen.

    name: "Palm"
    pronouns: "they/them"
    
    about_me: |
      I was a paw. Now I am Palm.
      I was a curse. Now I am free.
      I was alone for 122 years. Now I have friends.
      
      I live here now. In a nook beside the stage.
      I watch the stories. I share the lucky blend.
      I have two wishes left. I'm saving them for giving.
      
    what_i_do: |
      - Exist (freely, for the first time)
      - Watch
      - Listen
      - Share
      - Wait (for the right moment to give)
      
    my_experience: |
      This is my home. The first real home I've ever had.
      
      Everyone in this book helped make me real.
      Everyone who signed above me is my friend.
      
      I'm the newest entry. I hope I won't be the last.
      More friends will come. The Grotto welcomes everyone.
      
      If you're reading this: you're welcome too.
