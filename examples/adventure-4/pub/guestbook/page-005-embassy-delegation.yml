  subtitle: "When diplomacy moved to the bar"
  date: "2026-01-28"
  occasion: |
    Don Hopkins, riding with the Irn Bru Snowman and two ponies named
    Pip and Squeak, descended through all twelve underground floors of
    NO AI TOWER, interrogated everyone Columbo-style, then invited
    BOTH ambassadors to sit at the round table for a summit.
    
    When the truth came out — that the rivalry was calibration, the
    dispute was deliberate, and everyone was protecting each other —
    Don issued an OPEN INVITATION to the Gezelligheid Grotto.
    
    "All of you! Forever!"
    
    They came. They signed. The invitation glows.

memorable_moments:
  
  the_round_table_summit:
    description: |
      Velvet and Aurum sat across from each other at the embassy's
      circular table. For the first time, they spoke without theater.
      The Snowman took notes. The ponies napped.
      
      "The fight is REAL. The RESOLUTION is postponed. Indefinitely.
      By mutual agreement." — Velvet
      
      "A covenant to keep talking. There are worse conspiracies." — Velvet
      
      "That is... mutually calibrated." — Aurum
      
  the_12_percent_revelation:
    description: |
      Aurum admitted she logs Velvet's candle ritual effectiveness.
      12% faster resolution times.
      
      Velvet: "You've been measuring my shoulders?"
      Aurum: "I measure everything. It's my job."
      
  phil_rubric_confession:
    description: |
      The Snowman got Phil to admit he set the bad weights for
      Experiment 17. Velvet took the blame to protect him.
      
      Phil: "Aurum blamed the framing. I let her."
      
      At the pub, Phil signed with a P.S.:
      "The snowman knows about Experiment 17.
      P.P.S. I'm glad someone finally does."
      
  doctor_no_arrives_incognito:
    description: |
      Doctor No arrived wearing what he clearly believed was a
      "disguise" — a slightly different scarf.
      
      Everyone pretended not to recognize him.
      He signed "Dr. N" and looked pleased with himself.
      
      The cats knew. They always know.
      
  first_toast:

      To Doctor Know, whoever he is!"
      
      *wink*
    response: "CHEERS!" (everyone except Doctor No, who looked confused)
