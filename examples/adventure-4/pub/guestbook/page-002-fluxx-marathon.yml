    about_me: |
      I design games. Have since the 90s. Fluxx was my first big one (1997).
      Chaos theory in card form. Rules that change as you play.
      
      Before games, I was a software programmer at NASA — worked on
      the Hubble Space Telescope. Met Kristin there in 1986.
      
      Tonight I watched a freed monkey learn to play.
      That's better than any award.
      
    what_i_do: |
      - Design games (Fluxx, Chrononauts, Pyramids, many more)
      - Make chaos structured and fun
      - Lose to my wife (repeatedly)
      - Take notes on new game ideas mid-session
      
    my_experience: |
      The house blend is EXCELLENT. Mammie's Pride? *chef's kiss*
      The company is better.
      
      Palm is a natural. Asked "what does this mean?" not "how do I win?"
      That's how you learn anything worth knowing.
      
      I may have designed a Bitterballen Keeper in my notes.
      Food Fluxx expansion incoming.
      
    favorite_moment: "Palm's accidental team victory. House rules > official rules."
    will_return: "Whenever there's a deck to shuffle"
    gift_to_palm: "The Prototype Deck — Meta Fluxx (unreleased)"
    secret: "May have designed a Bitterballen Keeper during the session"

    about_me: |
      I was an electronics engineer at NASA. Met Andy at Goddard in 1986.
      Married him. Then we started making games together.
      
      Fun fact: At 16, I solved a Rubik's Cube in 35.50 seconds
      on the TV show "That's Incredible."
      
      I've been playtesting Andy's ideas since before Fluxx existed.
      I win more than he admits.
      
    what_i_do: |
      - Run Looney Labs
      - Beat Andy at his own games
      - Strategic timing (in games and life)
      - Know when to trash The Cops
      
    my_experience: |
      This place has SOUL. You can feel it.
      
      The cats judge harder than any tournament.
      Stroopwafel gave Palm SIX CATS. I've never seen that.
      
      The bong named "Het Orakel" is beautiful glasswork.
      The Grand Daddy Purple through it was transcendent.
      
    favorite_moment: "Round 3 victory. Move A Keeper. That's the game right there."
    will_return: "To defend my title. And for the bitterballen."
    orders: "Grand Daddy Purple through Het Orakel"
