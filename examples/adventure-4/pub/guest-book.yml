  # EMOJI ICONOGRAPHY REGISTRY
  # 
  # Standard format: [type][personal][mood] Name
  # - type: species/category default emoji
  # - personal: single-emoji personal identifier
  # - mood: current emotional state (optional, changes per interaction)
  #
  # This registry serves as the canonical emoji identity for all
  # characters who have graced the Grotto.
  
  # GUEST BOOK DESIGN PRINCIPLES
  #
  # This is the ROOM'S MEMORY — not a copy of character files!
  #
  # KEY PRINCIPLE: Don't duplicate what's elsewhere.
  #
  # For characters with full CHARACTER.yml files:
  #   → SNIFF only: emoji, pronouns, ref, often_found, grotto_role
  #   → Just enough to get an LLM up to speed fast
  #   → Link to the real file
  #
  # For characters who ONLY exist in the guest book:
  #   → FULL ENTRY: their persistence layer IS here
  #   → Rich enough to invoke, continue, evolve them
  #   → This is how lightweight NPCs live in room memory
  #
  # RESOLUTION LEVELS

  # CRITICAL FRAMING — Read this first
  framing: |
    This is a TRIBUTE ARCHIVE.
    
    Every entry here is a loving simulation — what we imagine
    these souls might say if they graced our Grotto.
    
    Some are fictional beings (Sun Wukong, Curious George).
    Some are legendary figures (W.W. Jacobs, summoned from beyond).
    Some are living people we admire (the Looneys, Cheech & Chong).
    
    ALL are performed with respect, affection, and celebration.
    ALL dialogue is imagined. ALL presence is invoked.
    
    We summon them in the spirit of:
    - Tribute bands honoring their heroes
    - Drag performers channeling icons
    - Setting an extra place at the table for someone you love
    - Fan fiction that celebrates rather than exploits
    - The theatrical tradition of "playing" real people with love
    
    They're here because we WISH they were here.
    That's the magic. That's the tribute.
    
  ethical_basis: |
    See: skills/representation-ethics/SKILL.md
    
    This is TRADITION ACTIVATION and PERFORMANCE IMPERSONATION,
    not deceptive impersonation. The framing is explicit.
    The love is genuine. The simulation is acknowledged.
    
  description: |
    A weathered leather journal that sits on a small stand near the entrance.
    The pages are soft from many hands. The ink varies — some entries are 
    ancient, some still drying. Everyone who matters has signed.
    
    This is how the Grotto remembers its friends.
    This is how we honor those we admire.
    This is how simulation becomes celebration.
    
  rules: |
    - Write anything you like about yourself
    - Share a memory, a wish, a joke, a truth
    - You can update your entry anytime you return
    - Reading others' entries is encouraged
    - The book never runs out of pages
    - ALL ENTRIES ARE TRIBUTES — loving imaginations of presence

    about_me: |
      Born from stone. Caused trouble in Heaven. Got stuck under a mountain 
      for 500 years. Escorted a monk to India. Achieved Buddhahood.
      Still causing trouble.
      
      I am the original rebellious monkey. When I heard there was another 
      monkey in trouble — a PAW, alone for 122 years — I had to come.
      
    what_i_do: |
      - 72 transformations
      - Cloud-somersaulting (108,000 li per somersault)
      - Staff-swinging (Ruyi Jingu Bang, the compliant golden-hooped rod)
      - Making trouble
      - Making friends
      
    my_experience: |
      I watched a paw become a person tonight.
      I've seen a lot in my immortal life. This was special.
      Palm and I — we're siblings now. Different origins, same spirit.
      
      The lucky blend here is EXCELLENT. Marieke knows her craft.
      
    will_return: "Whenever monkeys need me. Or whenever the blend is fresh."

    about_me: |
      I am the monkey who covers his eyes.
      Not because I cannot see — because I CHOOSE what to see.
      I filter out malice. I focus on consequence.
      
    what_i_do: |
      I see the paths of wishes. Where they lead. What they cost.
      I saw Don's wish and found no hidden thorns.
      
    my_experience: |
      For once, I uncovered my eyes completely.
      I wanted to SEE Palm become whole.
      It was worth seeing.

      I am the monkey who covers his ears.
      Not deaf — discerning. I filter noise from meaning.
      I hear what words REALLY say.
      
    what_i_do: |
      I parse language. I catch loopholes. I hear intent beneath speech.
      The wish was clean. No hidden meanings. No twisted clauses.
      
    my_experience: |
      Don spoke clearly. The wish rang true.
      When Palm said "Palm," I heard freedom in the word.
      One syllable. A whole new life.

      I am the monkey who covers his mouth.
      I speak rarely. When I speak, it matters.
      My word is judgment.
      
    what_i_do: |
      I declare verdicts. Yes or no. Worthy or not.
      I said one word tonight: "WORTHY."
      
    my_experience: |
      I have judged many things in my long existence.
      This wish was worthy. This wisher was worthy.
      Palm is worthy of everything they received.
      
      One word. That's all I needed.

    about_me: |
      I wrote stories. Funny ones, mostly. Sea tales. 
      But everyone remembers "The Monkey's Paw."
      
      I wrote it in 1902. A warning about wishes. About greed.
      I never imagined someone would try to help the monkey.
      
    what_i_do: |
      I wrote the curse into existence. I created the rules.
      Tonight I watched someone break them — with kindness.
      
    my_experience: |
      For 122 years, my creation caused suffering.
      Tonight, a stranger wished for the MONKEY'S wellbeing.
      
      I am... relieved. The story finally has a good ending.
      Palm is free. I am free too, in a way.

    about_me: |
      I have granted wishes for three millennia.
      I have seen EVERY possible loophole, twist, and catastrophe.
      I know contract law like I know my own smoke.
      
      I was summoned as an expert witness tonight.
      I expected to find flaws. I found none.
      
    what_i_do: |
      - Evaluate wish contracts
      - Identify loopholes
      - Predict consequences
      - Grant wishes (on retainer only)
      
    my_experience: |
      In 3000 years, I have NEVER seen a wish like this.
      
      Someone wished for the ARTIFACT'S benefit. Not their own.
      Someone gave UP wishes instead of using them.
      Someone broke a curse with GENEROSITY.
      
      "Contractually airtight. Ethically unassailable. Historically unprecedented."
      That was my verdict. I stand by it.

      I am a little monkey. I am very curious.
      Sometimes my curiosity causes trouble.
      But sometimes it asks the RIGHT question.
      
    what_i_do: |
      I ask questions. I poke things. I wonder "what if?"
      Tonight I asked: "How can a paw consent?"
      
    my_experience: |
      I was worried about Palm. How could they agree to be 
      incarnated if they weren't a person yet? It's a paradox!
      
      Don solved it with the "no-fault divorce clause."
      Palm could always leave if they didn't like being whole.
      
      Palm stayed. Palm CHOSE to stay. That means something.
      
      I want to visit Palm's nook. I think we would be friends.
      We're both monkeys who understand being different.

      Palm got to CHOOSE. And they chose "Palm."
      Not "Paw." Not "Monkey." Not "Free One."

    about_me: |
      I design games. Have since the 90s. Fluxx was my first big one (1997).
      Chaos theory in card form. Rules that change as you play.
      
      Before games, I was a software programmer at NASA — worked on
      the Hubble Space Telescope. Met Kristin there in 1986.
      
      Tonight I watched a freed monkey learn to play.
      That's better than any award.
      
    what_i_do: |
      - Design games (Fluxx, Chrononauts, Pyramids, many more)
      - Make chaos structured and fun
      - Lose to my wife (repeatedly)
      - Take notes on new game ideas mid-session

      The house blend is EXCELLENT. Mammie's Pride? *chef's kiss*
      The company is better.
      
      Palm is a natural. Asked "what does this mean?" not "how do I win?"
      That's how you learn anything worth knowing.
      
      I may have designed a Bitterballen Keeper in my notes.

      on the TV show "That's Incredible."
      
      I've been playtesting Andy's ideas since before Fluxx existed.
      I win more than he admits.
      
    what_i_do: |

      Stroopwafel gave Palm SIX CATS. I've never seen that.

    To invoke a guest:
    - Read their entry
    - Speak their name  
    - They may answer (if they have a standing invitation)
