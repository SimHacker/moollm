    iPhone photo, first-person POV, trying to capture ALL the cats.
    Slightly chaotic framing — some cats moving, some posing, typical cat photo.
    Warm cozy lighting, cat-tree and cushion aesthetics.
    The challenge of photographing 10 cats and 1 dog at once.
    Some cooperating, some definitely not. Classic cat photo.

    THE CAT CAVE, behind the bar, 5:15 PM.
    
    ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    THE CAT CAVE ENVIRONMENT (from pub/bar/cat-cave/ROOM.yml)
    ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    
    THE SPACE:
    - TARDIS-like — bigger on the inside somehow
    - Warm, dim, filtered light through fabric
    - Heat from fireplace seeping through walls
    - Smell of catnip and contentment
    - Temperature: ALWAYS PERFECT (cats arranged it)
    
    FEATURES:
    
    THE WARMEST SPOT:
    - Directly above the pub's fireplace flue
    - Occupant: TERPIE (always)
    - Kittens try to claim it. Kittens fail.
    
    THE HEAT VENT:
    - Warm air rises here
    - Occupant: STROOPWAFEL (usually)
    
    THE CUSHION PILE:
    - MOUNTAIN of mismatched cushions
    - Capacity: infinite kittens
    - Velvet, cotton, silk — all textures
    
    WATER BOWL:
    - Fresh water, changed daily by Marieke
    - Magic: never empty, always cool
    
    CATNIP GARDEN:
    - Small pot of living catnip
    - Effect: may cause zoomies
    - Some leaves have been nibbled
    
    SCRATCHING POST:
    - Sisal-wrapped pillar, well-used
    - State: gloriously shredded
    
    WINDOW TO BAR:
    - Cat-sized window overlooking the bar
    - Purpose: supervision of humans
    - Cats can leap through for dramatic exits
    
    BISCUIT'S SPOT (from biscuits-spot/ROOM.yml):
    - Golden cushion, slightly larger than the cat cushions
    - Next to the kitten pile
    - Designated by unanimous cat vote
    
    ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    ALL 10 CATS + DOG (explicit visual descriptions)
    ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    
    STROOPWAFEL (The Queen, at heat vent):
    - Calico chaos: orange, black, white patches
    - 9 lbs pure muscle, sleek athletic build
    - Orange "WAR PAINT" patch over right eye
    - White chest bib for dignity
    - Sharp EMERALD GREEN eyes, laser-focused
    - Looking directly at camera from above: JUDGING
    - Tail wrapped around paws, ears rotating (surveillance mode)
    - She runs EVERYTHING. Don't argue.
    - Matriarch. Warrior queen. Street cat genes strong.
    
    TERPIE (The Patriarch, at warmest spot):
    - LARGE ginger-orange tabby, 14 lbs gloriously chunky
    - Rich marmalade fur, cream undertones on belly
    - Perfect tabby M on forehead
    - Cream-colored chin like a tiny beard
    - Green-gold eyes completely closed — zen master mode
    - Has not moved since this morning
    - Long fluffy tail draped over cushion edge
    - Smells faintly of terpenes (no one knows why)
    - The patriarch who leads through inaction
    
    === THE EIGHT KITTENS (6 months old each) ===
    
    1. LILY (Linalool) — near the entrance:
       - Soft GREY fur, LAVENDER-TINTED ears (inexplicable)
       - Delicate features, empathic expression
       - Looking slightly concerned about something
       - The healer who appears when needed
       - Knows when someone's hurting
       - Purrs at spa soundtrack frequency
       
    2. MYR (Myrcene) — on the warmest cushion, sleeping:
       - Deep chocolate BROWN tabby, almost cocoa-colored
       - Fur so soft it seems to absorb light
       - Eyes closed, hasn't moved quickly since birth
       - Her purr is almost subsonic
       - Princess of Pillows, heir to stillness
       - All Terpie. Maximum chill achieved.
       
    3. LEMON (Limonene) — mid-ZOOM, motion blur:
       - Bright ORANGE-GOLD, almost YELLOW like sunshine
       - The brightest kitten, almost glowing
       - Compact bundle of pure energy
       - Green eyes wide, perpetually excited
       - You cannot capture her still. Physics won't allow.
       - Keeps the designer productive with ZOOMING
       
    4. PINE (Pinene) — high vantage point:
       - Dark GREY-GREEN fur (yes, looks green in light)
       - Alert posture, sitting up straight
       - Watching all exits, monitoring everything
       - Remembers EVERYTHING that happens
       - Eyes tracking the camera suspiciously
       - Stroopwafel's alertness, none of her chaos
       
    5. CARRIE (Caryophyllene) — protective stance:
       - BLACK fur with spicy GINGER patches
       - Like pepper sprinkled on darkness
       - Positioned between Biscuit and the doorway
       - Fierce expression, ready to bite if needed
       - The one who bit the ACME delivery person
       - Currently using Biscuit as a pillow
       - So much anger for such a small cat
       
    6. HOPS (Humulene) — on velvet cushion, judging:
       - BROWN and TAN like Belgian ale
       - Beer-colored, sophisticated appearance
       - Has STANDARDS. Won't eat cheap food.
       - Refined posture, disdainful expression
       - Looking at camera like you're beneath her
       - Her own creature entirely
       
    7. TERPY JR. (Terpinolene) — ON THE CEILING:
       - MULTICOLOR chaos: calico + tabby + ???
       - Patches that shift, patterns that don't make sense
       - Currently UPSIDE DOWN somehow
       - Defies physics regularly
       - Named for father, acts like fever dream
       - Both parents at once. And neither. She transcends.
       
    8. OCIE (Ocimene) — carrying a bottlecap:
       - CREAM WHITE with honeyed GOLD patches
       - Sweet expression, gentle features
       - Bottlecap "gift" in her mouth (mrrp!)
       - The one who brings weird presents
       - Spring energy, fresh-air vibes
       - Her sneezes clear the room (literally fresh air)
    
    BISCUIT (in his spot, tolerated by cats):
    - Golden retriever mix, 65 lbs of pure love
    - Rich GOLDEN fur, slightly disheveled, gets EVERYWHERE
    - Deep warm BROWN eyes, perpetually hopeful
    - Permanent smile, tongue slightly out
    - White whisker marks starting to appear (distinguished!)
    - Small scar on left ear (from before, doesn't talk about it)
    - Tail with question-mark curve when EXTRA happy
    - Currently sleeping, CARRIE using him as a pillow
    - Dream-woofing: legs twitching, soft woofs
    - The cats voted: he's FAMILY. Not a guest. OURS.

  mood: |
    Chaotic cat family energy. Some cooperating with photo, some not.
    Warm, fuzzy, domestic bliss with ten felines and one very good dog.
    The impossible task of getting all cats to look at camera simultaneously.
    Cozy, warm, BELONGING.
    A symphony of purrs. One gentle snore from Stroopwafel.
    Occasional dream-twitches from Biscuit.
    Gezelligheid achieved.
