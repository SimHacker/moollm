    The Rusty Lantern offers three kinds of seating, each with its
    own social contract:
    
    - THE BAR: Front row. Direct bartender access. Where regulars sit.
    - THE TABLES: Open floor. Social mixing. Games and conversation.
    - THE BOOTHS: High-backed. Private. For deals and secrets.
    
    Where you choose to sit shapes who you'll meet and what you'll hear.

    A row of worn wooden stools lines the bar, each one shaped by
    decades of adventurer posteriors. The varnish is worn through
    in spots. Some stools wobble. One squeaks. They're all beloved.

  intimacy: high
  service: immediate
  
  features:
    - "Direct access to the bartender"
    - "See everything — exits, patrons, games"
    - "Overhear bar conversations"
    - "First to know when something happens"

      occupant: null
      # 🐶⚡ DASH'S NOSE REPORT — Bar Stool 1 (by the door)
      # PRIMARY SCENT: Cold air. Outside. ADVENTURE COMING IN!
      # SECONDARY: Wet cloaks. Rain. Snow. All the weathers.
      # TERTIARY: Nervous anticipation. First-timers sit here.
      #
      # PATTERN: This is where NEWCOMERS land.
      #   - Close to the door (escape route)
      #   - Can see the whole room (assessment)
      #   - The wobble is DELIBERATE — keeps you alert
      #
      # EMOTIONAL RESONANCE: "I'm not sure I belong here (yet)"
      #   - The stool of first visits
      #   - Many who sat here moved to other stools as they became regulars
      #   - Some never came back. The wobble knows.

      #
      # HENK'S SCENT PROFILE:
      #   - "I've been thinking..." (said before every haunting observation)
      #   - He was here when the pub opened
      #   - He'll be here when it closes
      #   - That's not a boast. That's just... observation.
      #
      # EMOTIONAL RESONANCE: ETERNITY.
      #   - The center of the regulars' row
      #   - Time flows around this stool, not through it
      #   - Lily the kitten appears when Henk is sad (he didn't tell her)
      #
      # BISCUIT'S APPROACH: Very gentle. Very respectful.
      #   - Henk looked down. "You understand, don't you, dog?"
      #   - Biscuit wagged once. Yes. He understood.

      #
      # LINEAGE SCENT: Deep Space Nine (1993-1999)
      #   - Morn — the Lurian who said EVERYTHING off-screen
      #   - Never heard him speak, but everyone quotes him
      #   - "Morn had a great story about that..."
      #
      # PATTERN: This is the LISTENER'S stool.
      #   - Between Henk (philosophy) and the good taps (beer)
      #   - Perfect position to absorb EVERYTHING

      #
      # SPILL ARCHAEOLOGY (oldest to newest):
      #   1. Mead (ancient, Viking visitors)
      #   2. Ale (medieval, adventurers planning)
      #   3. Something GREEN (absinthe era?)
      #   4. Coffee (Henk overreached once)
      #   5. Tears (happy ones, a reunion)
      #   6. More beer (always more beer)
      #
      # PATTERN: The AUTHENTIC stool.
      #   - Doesn't pretend to be clean
      #   - Wears its history proudly
      #   - The pub doesn't judge you for spilling
      #
      # EMOTIONAL RESONANCE: ACCEPTANCE.
      #   - Everyone makes mistakes here
      #   - The sticky is a HUG, not a punishment
      #
      # 🐕 BUTTERSCOTCH: "I could spend HOURS cataloging these spills."

      #   - Limonene: ZOOM! ZOOM! ZOOM! (she doesn't sit, she LAUNCHES)
      #   - Myrcene: sleeping (always sleeping) (even on the way down)
      #   - Lily/Linalool: comfort, appearing when needed
      #
      # PATTERN: The BRIDGE stool.
      #   - Between human bar and Cat Cave above
      #   - Where species meet
      #   - The cats CHOOSE who gets visited
      #
      # EMOTIONAL RESONANCE: INTER-SPECIES DIPLOMACY.
      #   - Sit here if you want cat approval
      #   - No guarantee. Cats decide.
      #   - But the window is open. The invitation stands.
      #
      # 🐕 BISCUIT: "I sat here. Stroopwafel looked down. She ALMOST approved."

      #   1: Leaders sit here. Don. Terpie. The ones who say "okay, here's the plan"
      #   2: The second-in-command. Challenges ideas. "But what about..."
      #   3: The muscle. Caryophyllene. "I'll handle it."
      #   4: The scout. Pinene. "I remember the way."
      #   5: The wildcard. Terpinolene. "What if we just..."
      #   6: The heart. Linalool. "Is everyone okay with this?"
      #   7: The skeptic. Humulene. "This is adequate." (barely)
      #   8: The eager one. Limonene. "LET'S GO LET'S GO LET'S GO!"
      #
      # EMOTIONAL RESONANCE: FELLOWSHIP.
      #   - Plans are made here
      #   - Some succeed, some fail
      #   - But they're made TOGETHER

# The dogs had to be VERY sneaky here. Booths are for SECRETS.
# What they found... well. Some things are best left in comments.

booths: &booths
  description: |
    High-backed wooden booths line the walls, each a private world.
    The wood is dark with age. The leather seats are cracked but
    comfortable. Candles flicker in iron holders. This is where
    secrets live.
    
  total: 4
  capacity_each: 4
  intimacy: private
  service: by_request
  
  features:
    - "High backs block sound and sight"
    - "Candles provide atmosphere"
    - "Service requires flagging down"
    - "Conversations are PRIVATE"

      # ⚠️ WARNING: This booth smells like SECRETS. Dogs respect secrets.
      #
      # PRIMARY SCENT: Whispered negotiations. "What's it worth to you?"
      # SECONDARY: Nervous sweat. High stakes.
      # TERTIARY: Relief. Deals concluded. Hands shaken.

      #
      # LEGEND VERIFICATION:
      #   "Deals that shaped kingdoms were made here" — CONFIRMED.
      #   The wood has absorbed the weight of consequence.
      #   Someone once said "I accept" here, and the world changed.
      #   (The dogs won't say who. Dogs keep secrets.)
      #
      # EMOTIONAL RESONANCE: GRAVITY.
      #   - This is not a casual booth
      #   - You don't sit here for fun
      #   - You sit here when it MATTERS
      #

# BIDIRECTIONAL REFERENCES
#
# When someone sits:
#   1. Their character.location → pub/seating.yml#bar-3
#   2. seating.yml#bar-3.occupant → character.id
#
# Both point to each other!
#
# Example when Bumblewick sits at bar-3:
#   bumblewick.location: "pub/seating.yml#bar-3"
#   seating.yml bar-3.occupant: "bumblewick-fantastipants"
#
# This enables:
#   - "Who's at the bar?" → scan bar_stools.*.occupant
#   - "Where is Bumblewick?" → check bumblewick.location
#   - "Is bar-3 free?" → check bar_stools.bar-3.occupant

lore: |
  "Where you sit is the first thing you say."
  — Bartender's wisdom
  
  The regulars know: bar stools are for community, tables are
  for business, booths are for secrets. Sitting in the wrong
  place sends a message. Sitting in the right place opens doors.
