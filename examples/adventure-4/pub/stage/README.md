# 🎭 The Stage

> *"All the world's a stage. This one has better lighting."*

**Performance space for the pub's entertainers.**

## 🌅 Overview

A raised wooden platform at one end of the pub, curtains framing the space. Footlights flicker. A single spotlight awaits its target.

This is where:
- Bards perform ballads
- Characters debut their monologues
- The 33-turn Fluxx game achieves legendary status
- 99 Bottles of Beer echoes through 8 voices in 28 seconds

Behind the curtain, a narrow corridor leads to **Palm's Nook** — the private quarters of Palm the Librarian Orangutan.
