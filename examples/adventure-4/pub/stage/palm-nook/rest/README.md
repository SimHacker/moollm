# 😴 Palm's Rest

> *"The softest room you've ever entered."*

**Where peace lives. Where Palm heals.**

---

## 🌅 Overview

A hand-woven Dutch hammock hangs between posts, swaying gently even when no one's in it. A meditation cushion sits in a perfect bubble of silence. And in the warmest corner, cats are always sleeping.

Light is dim here. Sounds are muffled. Time moves differently. Slower. Kinder.

This is where Palm heals. After 122 years of granting twisted wishes, Palm finally has a place to just... be.

*"Marieke checks on Palm here sometimes. Just peeks in. Sees the hammock swaying. Smiles. Leaves a stroopwafel by the door."*
