# 🧗 Palm's Gym

> *"The Infinite Climb stretches upward forever."*

**Sun Wukong's gift — a jungle gym that never ends.**

---

## 🌅 Overview

You step through a doorway that shouldn't fit this much space.

The Infinite Climb stretches upward forever. Branches spiral in impossible geometries. Vines hang at exactly the right distances. Platforms appear where you need them.

Somewhere high above, you can hear Palm swinging. Or maybe that's echoes from a climb that hasn't happened yet.
