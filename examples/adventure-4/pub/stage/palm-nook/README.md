# 🐒 Palm's Nook

> *"Ook."*

**Private quarters of Palm the Librarian Capuchin.**

---

## 🌅 Overview

Behind the stage curtain, through a corridor lined with banana peels and discarded playing cards, lies a cozy nook that smells of old books and overripe fruit.

**Palm** sits here — the great orange philosopher, speed-reader of infinite libraries, dealer of the legendary 33-turn Fluxx game.

The space is organized (by capuchin standards) into distinct areas:

- **The Study** — Where Palm reads, writes, and types
- **The Gym** — Where Palm climbs infinitely
- **The Rest Area** — Where Palm hammocks
- **The Play Area** — Where Palm deals
