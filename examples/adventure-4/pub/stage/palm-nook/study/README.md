# 📚 Palm's Study

> *"The soft hum of infinite typewriters fills the air."*

**Where Palm reads, writes, and navigates the library of all possible books.**

## 🌅 Overview

A cozy writing nook within a nook. Mahogany desk against the wall, ergonomic monkey chair, and a bookshelf that knows what you need to read.

Sunlight (from somewhere) catches dust motes dancing. Papers stack in organized chaos. Every surface has meaning.

The infinite typewriters hum in harmony — Don's gift, Dasher-inspired navigation keys that can reach any story ever written or yet to be written.
