## 🖼️ The Portrait

Above the Infinity Desk hangs **Palm's Portrait** — a Dutch Golden Age oil painting commemorating his transformation from cursed ACME Monkey's Paw to sovereign soul.

*"The Philosopher at His Desk"* — Rembrandt's scholars meet Vermeer's domestic scenes. Palm poses surrounded by infinite typewriters, kittens playing at his feet. The gold frame catches the warm amber lamplight.

## 🌅 Overview

A cozy writing nook within a nook. Mahogany desk against the wall, ergonomic monkey chair, and a bookshelf that knows what you need to read.

Sunlight (from somewhere) catches dust motes dancing. Papers stack in organized chaos. Every surface has meaning.

The infinite typewriters hum in harmony — Don's gift, Dasher-inspired navigation keys that can reach any story ever written or yet to be written.
