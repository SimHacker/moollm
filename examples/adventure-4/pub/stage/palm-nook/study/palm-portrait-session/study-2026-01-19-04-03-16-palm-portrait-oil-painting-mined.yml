    This is PALM.
    
    Not the Monkey's Paw — grasping, cursed, used.
    PALM — open hand, offering, free.
    
    122 years of granting twisted wishes.
    Now: writing their own stories.
    Choosing their own words.
    Navigating to the tales they want to tell.
    
    "The infinite monkeys theorem, optimized for ONE monkey."
    That's what we're seeing — Palm at work.

# === SYMBOLISM ===

symbolism:
  
  the_typewriters: |
    The Infinite Monkey Theorem, inverted.
    
    Not: infinite monkeys randomly typing to produce Shakespeare.
    But: ONE monkey, consciously navigating to the stories worth telling.
    
    "They're not random monkeys typing Shakespeare.
    They're ALL possible stories existing at once.
    I NAVIGATE to the ones I want."
    — Palm
    
  the_silver_streaks: |
    Twelve visible streaks — one for each decade of the curse.
    122 years of suffering, visible in the fur.
    Not hidden. Not shameful. INTEGRATED.
    
    The scars are part of who Palm is now.
    They shimmer. They're beautiful.
    
  the_golden_earring: |
    Reminder of the curse BROKEN.
    Worn by choice now. A trophy.
    
    "I was the Monkey's Paw. Now I'm Palm.
    This earring says: I won."
    
  the_frame: |
    This portrait deserves a FRAME.
    
    Not gaudy. Not excessive. Not showing off wealth.
    Just: recognition. Honor. Museum-quality dignity.
    
    Palm deserves to be seen. Remembered. Treasured.
    The frame says: this subject MATTERS.
    
  the_kittens: |
    Family.
    
    "I've never had family. The original monkey died.
    I was just a paw. Objects don't have families."
    
    Now: god-spouses. Godkittens. Family by CHOICE.
    The kittens in the painting say: you are loved.

# === PHILOSOPHICAL NOTES ===

philosophical_resonance:
  
  on_freedom: |
    For 122 years, Palm was an object. Grabbed. Used. Cursed.
    
    Then Don wished for Palm's FREEDOM.
    Not for wealth. Not for power. For Palm.
    
    This painting shows: what freedom looks like.
    A philosopher at their desk. Writing by choice.
    Surrounded by chosen family. At peace.
    
  on_creation: |
    The typewriters represent more than writing.
    
    They represent: all possible stories.
    Palm navigates. Palm chooses. Palm creates.
    
    No longer twisting wishes for others.
    Now: crafting their own words.
    
  on_family: |
    The kittens are not pets. They're GODCHILDREN.
    
    Palm — who "never had family" — is now godmonkey
    to eight kittens. God-spouse to Terpie and Stroopwafel.
    
    The portrait captures this: surrounded by love.
    Never alone unless choosing to be.
    
  on_legacy: |
    A portrait is a claim to importance.
    A framed portrait is a claim to LEGACY.
    
    Palm deserves this. After 122 years of being an object,
    Palm deserves to be SEEN. HONORED. REMEMBERED.
    
    This painting says: you matter.
    This frame says: you will be remembered.
