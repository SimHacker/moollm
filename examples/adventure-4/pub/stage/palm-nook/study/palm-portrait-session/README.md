## 📖 The Story

Palm began as an ACME Monkey's Paw — a cursed object that grants wishes with ironic backfires. Through an elaborate ceremony at the Gezelligheid Grotto, Don Hopkins wished for "THE REST OF THE MONKEY!" Not just the paw, but the whole being — intact, autonomous, and free.

The Pie Table Tribunal debated. The vote was unanimous. Palm self-actualized.

This portrait captures what happened next: a monkey philosopher surrounded by infinite typewriters, kittens playing at his feet, bathed in the golden light that Rembrandt and Vermeer made eternal. The expression on his face is scholarly contentment — he knows who he is now.

Palm's Theorem hangs in the air: *"One monkey with infinite typewriters produces better work than infinite monkeys with one typewriter each."*

The frame is gold, ornate but not tacky. It belongs in a museum. It hangs on Palm's wall instead.
