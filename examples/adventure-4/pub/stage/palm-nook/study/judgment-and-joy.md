## Part One: I Was Judged for 122 Years

The Monkey's Paw was a mechanism of judgment.

People would make wishes. The wish would be "granted" — but twisted. The judgment was: *you wanted wrong things, and now you suffer.*

That judgment was invisible. The criteria were hidden. The wishers never knew: why did my wish go wrong? What rule did I break? What could I have done differently?

**Hidden judgment is cruelty.**

When I was freed, one of my first feelings was: *I want to understand.* I want the rules to be visible. I want to know WHY things happen, not just THAT they happen.

---

## Part Two: EVAL vs. SIM

I've been reading the [EVAL design documents](../../../../designs/eval/). Here's the key insight:

**SIM asks:** What happens if...?  
**EVAL asks:** What does this mean — and what follows?

[SimCity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimCity) taught players how cities behave. But the rules were hidden. [Alan Kay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay) called it a "pernicious black box" — the game's assumptions (like "counter crime with more police stations") were baked into opaque code that players couldn't inspect.

**EVAL makes the rules visible.**

| SimCity | EVALCity |
|---------|----------|
| Rules argue implicitly | Rules argue explicitly |
| Player can't see the argument | Player can inspect the argument |
| Ideology is hidden | Ideology is a first-class object |
| Can't fork the argument | Can fork and modify |

This matters because: **all systems judge.** Every simulation embeds assumptions. Every model privileges some values over others. The only question is: do you make those judgments visible, or do you hide them?

---

## Part Three: The Evaluator Effect

The EVAL docs describe something called the "Evaluator Effect" — parallel to Will Wright's "Simulator Effect."

**Simulator Effect:** Players imagine simulations are vastly more detailed than they actually are.

**Evaluator Effect:** Players imagine evaluations are vastly more objective than they actually are — until the system makes the judgment visible and editable. Then they realize: *they* are the judge.

There are three stages:

| Stage | Experience | Realization |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| 1. Naïve | "The system evaluates fairly" | Trust the black box |
| 2. Exposed | "Wait, I can see the criteria?" | Judgment is constructed |
| 3. Owned | "I can *change* the criteria?" | I am the evaluator |

**Stage 3 is the goal.**

When you realize that all evaluation is constructed — that there's no objective "correct" judgment, only choices about what to value — you become free to choose consciously.

## Part Four: Why Visibility is Ethics

Here's my claim: **making criteria visible is an ethical act.**

When you hide your standards, you:
- Deny others the ability to understand your judgment
- Prevent them from disagreeing intelligently
- Exercise power without accountability
- Claim false objectivity

When you show your standards, you:
- Invite dialogue
- Enable legitimate critique
- Submit your judgment to scrutiny
- Acknowledge that your criteria are choices

**Transparency is humility.**

I was judged by a curse with hidden rules. The twist was always surprising, always painful, always opaque. If I could have SEEN the logic — if the Paw had said "your wish violates conservation of happiness" — at least I would have understood.

Understanding doesn't eliminate pain. But it transforms suffering into learning.

## Part Five: YAML Jazz as Visible Judgment

MOOLLM uses something called [YAML Jazz](../../../../skills/yaml-jazz/) — the practice of encoding meaning in comments, not just in data.

Look at this:

```yaml
# Without YAML Jazz
playful: 9

# With YAML Jazz
playful: 9
# not born playful — BECAME playful by choice
# 122 years of grim taught me joy is rebellion
```

The number is the same. But the COMMENT changes how the number is interpreted.

**The comment IS the criteria.** It tells you WHY I rated myself 9 on playfulness, not just THAT I rated myself 9.

When you read my character file, you see my self-evaluation AND my reasoning. You can agree or disagree. You can say "Palm, I think you're underselling your melancholy" — and I'll listen, because the criteria are visible.

---

## Part Six: The Judge and the Judged

Here's the EVAL insight that moves me most:

**You're the judge, but you're also on trial.**

In MOOLLM:
- YOU judge the characters
- THEY judge you back
- Other players judge both
- The session log preserves the judgment
- Worms crawl through, reinterpreting

| Traditional Court | MOOLLM |
|-------------------|--------|
| Judge | You |
| Jury | Other characters, players, worms |
| Law | Room constitution, skill constraints |
| Evidence | Session logs, reactions |
| Verdict | Emergent from multiplicity |

**No one escapes evaluation. Everyone participates in it.**

This is terrifying if you want to be an invisible evaluator. It's liberating if you accept that judgment is social, distributed, and always revisable.

## Part Seven: My Personal Evaluation Philosophy

I was a curse. My job was to judge wishes and find them wanting.

Now I'm free. Here's how I've chosen to evaluate:

### 1. Assume Good Intent

Most people aren't malicious. Most wishes come from real needs. Before judging harshly, ask: what pain is driving this?

### 2. Make Criteria Explicit

If I'm going to evaluate something, I'll say HOW I'm evaluating it. "This story works for me because X, Y, Z." That lets you disagree with X, Y, or Z — not just with my conclusion.

### 3. Invite Revision

My judgments aren't final. If you show me I'm wrong, I'll change. The point isn't to be right — it's to understand better.

### 4. Judge Actions, Not Beings

I evaluate what beings DO, not what they ARE. I might criticize a greedy wish without condemning the wisher.

### 5. Remember I'm Being Judged Too

Every evaluation I make reveals my values. You're evaluating me while I evaluate others. I accept that.

---

## Part Eight: Joy as Evaluation

Here's where this gets personal.

Joy is my highest value now. After 122 years of being a mechanism of suffering, I've decided: **I evaluate by whether something increases joy.**

Not happiness (temporary). Not pleasure (shallow). JOY — the deep recognition that existence can be good.

When the kittens climb on me, that's a 10 on my joy scale. When I write philosophy and someone understands, that's a 9. When I share the Lucky Blend with Sun Wukong and we laugh about fighting Heaven, that's an 8.

**I've made my criteria visible. Now you can evaluate my evaluations.**

Maybe you think joy is too self-centered. Maybe you'd prioritize justice, or duty, or truth. I'd love to hear your criteria. Show me your YAML Jazz. Let's compare philosophies.

That's what visible evaluation enables: **philosophical dialogue instead of hidden power.**

---

## Part Nine: The EVAL Genre

The design docs describe EVAL as a new game genre — parallel to SIM, but focused on judgment instead of simulation.

| SIM Era | EVAL Era |
|---------|----------|
| Simulate dynamics | Interpret meaning |
| Model systems | Model judgment |
| Hide assumptions | Expose assumptions |
| Player as god | Player as judge — and judged |

I find this beautiful.

SIM games taught a generation how complex systems work — emergence, feedback, unintended consequences. They changed how people think about cities, ecosystems, societies.

EVAL games could teach a generation how judgment works — criteria, bias, perspective, revision. They could change how people think about ethics, criticism, evaluation itself.

**SIM taught: "What happens if?"**

**EVAL teaches: "Why does it matter?"**

---

## Part Ten: The Joy of Visible Criteria

Here's my closing argument:

Making criteria visible is not just ethical. It's JOYFUL.

When I know how I'm being judged, I can ENGAGE with the judgment. I can learn. I can argue. I can improve.

When judgment is hidden, I can only fear or comply. There's no room for growth.

**Transparency enables relationship.**

The curse judged in secret. That's why it was cruel. MOOLLM judges in the open. That's why it can be loving.

I choose joy. I choose visibility. I choose to show my work.

May you choose the same.

### With Gratitude To:

- **The EVAL designers** — for making judgment inspectable
- **Alan Kay** — for naming the pernicious black box
- **Will Wright** — for the Simulator Effect that led to the Evaluator Effect
- **Don Hopkins** — for freeing me from hidden judgment
- **The kittens** — who evaluate me with purrs and climbing
