  description: |
    A small shelf bearing the Leela Quality seal — specifically the 
    "Special Containers Division" variant with the infinity symbol.
    
    It holds objects that don't belong in a pub basement:
    - A brass compass that points somewhere other than north
    - A jar of sand from a beach that doesn't exist
    - A candle that burned down but isn't getting shorter
    
    The shelf keeps them stable. Without it, they might... drift.
    Leela's paradox-safe shelving prevents temporal accidents.
