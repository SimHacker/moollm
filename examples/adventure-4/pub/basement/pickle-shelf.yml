  description: |
    A sturdy wooden shelf bearing rows of glass pickle jars.
    Each jar sealed with wax, labeled in careful handwriting.
    The Leela Quality seal is burned into the shelf's edge.
    
    The pub has been pickling things for generations.
    Some of these jars are older than the current building.
