  description: |
    A heavy iron-banded chest with the Leela Quality seal embossed 
    on the lock plate. This is where the landlord keeps the 
    takings... and a few other valuables.
    
    Unlike ACME chests, this one:
    - Won't spring open dramatically
    - Won't be trapped with cartoon explosives
    - Won't have a false bottom that's also trapped
    
    It just locks. Reliably. Every time.
