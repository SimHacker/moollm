  description: |
    A large oak barrel with a brass tap, bearing the Leela Quality seal.
    A chalked sign reads "HELP YOURSELF - HONOR SYSTEM" with a coin jar nearby.
    
    Unlike ACME products, this barrel won't explode, leak, or 
    spontaneously transform into something else. It just works.
