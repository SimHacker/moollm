# 🍷 The Stone Cellar

> *"Cool, dark, patient. The basement knows how to wait."*

**Where provisions rest and secrets hide.**

---

## 🌅 Overview

Cool stone walls weep moisture. Wooden racks line the walls, holding barrels and bottles. The smell of damp earth, old wine, and something faintly herbal.

A single oil lamp flickers, casting long shadows between the stacked provisions. The floor is packed earth, worn smooth by centuries of footsteps.

Something about this place feels older than the pub above. The stones remember things the building has forgotten.

Behind the largest barrel... there's a door.

Nobody talks about it. The landlord pretends not to know. But the door is there, and it leads **somewhere**.
