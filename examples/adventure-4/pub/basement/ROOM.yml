# The Basement — Cool Storage Below The Rusty Lantern

    Cool stone walls weep moisture. Wooden racks line the walls,
    holding barrels and bottles. The smell of damp earth, old wine,
    and something faintly herbal.
    
    A single oil lamp flickers, casting long shadows between the 
    stacked provisions. The floor is packed earth, worn smooth 
    by centuries of footsteps.
