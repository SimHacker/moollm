  # PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION — this copy has LIVED
  description: |
    A photocopied academic paper, clearly rescued from some grad student's 
    apartment circa 2026. The pages are:
    
    - **Dog-eared** at multiple sections (someone's bookmarks)
    - **Coffee-stained** on pages 3, 7, and 12 (espresso rings, overlapping)
    - **Bong-water splashed** on page 47 (the smell lingers)
    - **Marginalia everywhere** in at least three different handwritings
    - **Underlined passages** with aggressive enthusiasm
    - **A dried flower** pressed between pages 22-23 (a dandelion, flattened)
    
    The cover page has a Post-It note that says: "THIS EXPLAINS EVERYTHING"
    (The Post-It is also coffee-stained.)
    
  condition: "Well-loved. Battle-scarred. Enlightening."
  portable: true
  value: priceless_to_the_right_buyer

# INTERACTIONS

actions:
  READ:
    effect: |
      You read Captain Ashford's postmodern adventure. 
      It's... surprisingly coherent for something this stained.
      The marginalia adds layers of interpretation.
      You're not sure if you understand it better or worse now.
    grants:
      - "+1 understanding of MOOLLM philosophy"
      - "+1 appreciation for Randy Farmer"
      - "permanent coffee craving"
      
  EXAMINE-STAINS:
    effect: |
      Each stain tells a story of late-night reading sessions.
      Someone loved this paper. Multiple someones.
      The bong water stain on page 47 is particularly evocative.
    insight: "Knowledge is absorbed through all senses, apparently."
    
  SMELL:
    effect: |
      Coffee. Old paper. Something herbal.
      The smell of enlightenment, or at least of trying.
    warning: "Page 47 is particularly pungent."
    
  TAKE:
    effect: "You add the paper to your inventory."
    note: "It's yours now. Add your own stains. Continue the tradition."
    
  ADD-ANNOTATION:
    requires: "writing implement"
    effect: "You become Reader #4."
    prompt: "What margin note do you add, and to which passage?"

# LORE

lore: |
  This paper has been passed around since Captain Ashford wrote it
  during adventure-2, while eating mushrooms in the kitchen.
  
  It's a tribute to Chip Morningstar's 1991 essay about attending
  a postmodern conference, and to Randy Farmer and Chip's pioneering
  work on Lucasfilm's Habitat.
  
  The paper argues that MOOLLM's filesystem-as-microworld approach
  isn't so different from Habitat's avatar-as-representation insight:
  both recognize that virtual spaces are defined by interaction,
  not implementation.
  
  Someone — maybe multiple someones — found this paper in the kitchen,
  photocopied it, annotated it extensively, and eventually left their
  copy here in the attic. The attic keeps what matters.
  
  The dried dandelion between pages 22-23 remains unexplained.

inspiration:
  - "Chip Morningstar's original 'How to Deconstruct Almost Anything'"
  - "Every academic paper that's been loved to death"
  - "The marginalia tradition"
  - "That one copy of Gödel, Escher, Bach everyone owns"
  - "The smell of used bookstores"
