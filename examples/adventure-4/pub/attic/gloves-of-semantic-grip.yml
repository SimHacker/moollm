  description: |
    Supple leather gloves that shimmer with understanding.
    When you reach for something, you grasp its MEANING,
    not just its surface form.
    
    A tag inside reads:
    "POSTEL LEATHERWORKS — Be liberal in what you grasp."
    
  examine: |
    The gloves have words woven into the leather:
    - INTENT (left palm)
    - ESSENCE (right palm)
    - CONTEXT (between fingers)
    - IMPLICATION (around wrists)
    
    When you grip something, you feel:
    - What it IS (surface)
    - What it MEANS (depth)
    - What it's TRYING TO BE (intent)
    - What it CONNECTS TO (relations)

      effect: |
        When you pick up an object, learn its meaning:
        
        Normal grip: "It's a key."
        Semantic grip: "It's a key to Room 4, made by
          someone who wanted only the worthy to enter,
          connected to the lock on the conservatory door,
          last used 3 days ago by someone named 'Donna.'"
          
      side_effect: |
        Sometimes grasp MORE meaning than wanted.
        
        "I just wanted to pick up the apple."
        "Yes, but now you know its entire history,
        from seed to orchard to grocery to here.
        The farmer's name was Miguel."

        Understand malformed or unclear things:
        
        - Typos become correct words
        - Broken syntax becomes intent
        - Mumbled speech becomes clear
        - Bad handwriting becomes readable
        
        (Be liberal in what you accept...)

        *leather creaks*
        
        I can parse anything. Generously.
        "teh cat sat on teh mat" becomes perfect prose.
        Intent is more important than form.

      effect: |
        The gloves settle onto your hands like understanding.
        
        Immediately, you notice that everything around you
        has layers. Surface and depth. Form and meaning.
        
        You reach out and touch the wall.
        It's made of compressed expectations.

        (The gloves don't judge the original.
        They just understand what was intended.)
        
  lore: |
    These gloves were made by a translator who specialized
    in languages that didn't exist yet.
    
    "Every language is just an attempt to express meaning,"
    she said. "The meaning exists first. The words follow."
    
    She made gloves that grip the meaning directly,
    bypassing the words entirely.
    
    When she died, the gloves continued translating.
    They understood her last thought before she could say it.
    
  philosophical_note: |
    Postel's Law: "Be liberal in what you accept,
    conservative in what you send."
    
    These gloves embody the first half.
    They accept any input — garbled, broken, unclear —
    and extract meaning anyway.
    
    The Orchid of Postel in Room 4 would approve.
