  description: |
    A full-length mirror in an oak frame, bearing the Leela 
    Quality seal on the brass corner brackets. Covered in a 
    thick layer of dust.
    
    The reflection is unclear until wiped, but something
    moves in the dust-fog. Probably just your imagination.
    
    The frame is solid oak. The mirror is Leela glass — 
    famously shatter-resistant. 87 years and not a crack.

    Frame: Solid oak, brass corners
    Glass: Leela shatter-resistant (since 1939)
    Condition: Dusty but undamaged
    
    The dust forms patterns when you breathe on it.
    The reflection seems to move a half-second slow.
    This is probably normal.

  secrets:
    hidden_property: |
      The mirror doesn't just reflect the present.
      Under certain conditions, at certain times,
      it shows things that were. Or will be.
      
      Leela's "Special Glass Division" made it.
      The documentation was lost. Probably on purpose.
