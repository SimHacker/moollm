  description: |
    A cardboard box with the Leela Quality seal, labeled "XMAS" 
    in faded marker. Tinsel pokes out through a torn corner.
    
    Smells like cinnamon and nostalgia.
    
    The box has survived decades of being shoved into attics,
    dropped during decoration, and forgotten for 11 months.
    Leela built it to last. It did.
