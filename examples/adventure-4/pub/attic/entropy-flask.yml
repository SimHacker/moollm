# 🧪 ENTROPY FLASK
# "Bottled chaos. Shake well before using."

  name: Entropy Flask
  type: consumable
  portable: true
  rarity: rare
  charges: 3
  
  description: |
    A glass flask filled with swirling, color-shifting liquid.
    The contents never settle. They can't — they're pure entropy.
    
    A warning label (in 17 languages, randomly arranged):
    
    > "CONTENTS: DISTILLED RANDOMNESS"
    > "SHAKE BEFORE USE (or don't, it doesn't matter)"
    > "SIDE EFFECTS: YES"
    
  examine: |
    The liquid inside is simultaneously:
    - Red (maybe)
    - Blue (possibly)
    - A color that doesn't exist (probably)
    - All colors at once (definitely, for now)
    
    The flask is warm and cold. The glass is solid and liquid.
    This is what happens when you bottle raw probability.
    
    Instructions (more like suggestions):
    1. Decide what you want to randomize
    2. Open flask carefully (or carelessly, same result)
    3. Pour, throw, or spill contents
    4. Accept consequences

        Target affected by pure randomness:
        
        ROLL D100:
        01-10: Transformation (temporary)
        11-20: Skill shuffle (random skill maxes)
        21-30: Timeline hiccup (relive last 10 seconds)
        31-40: Personality inversion (brief)
        41-50: Weather change (localized)
        51-60: Nearby objects animate
        61-70: Languages shuffled
        71-80: Size alteration (grow or shrink)
        81-90: Teleport (not far, just inconvenient)
        91-99: Wild magic surge
        100:   Absolutely nothing (the rarest outcome)

      parameters:
        - target: "What to randomize (self, object, situation)"
      effect: |
        *SPLASH*
        
        The entropy contacts [target].
        
        Reality shivers. Probability collapses in unexpected ways.
        The outcome is... [roll pending]
        
        Whatever happens, it won't be what you expected.
        That's guaranteed. It's the ONLY thing guaranteed.
        
    SHAKE:
      description: "Agitate the entropy"
      effect: |
        You shake the flask.
        
        This does nothing. The entropy is already maximally agitated.
        But it appreciates the gesture.
        
    PEEK:
      description: "Try to see what's inside"
      effect: |
        You peer into the flask.
        
        You see:
        - Everything
        - Nothing
        - Yourself (older? younger? sideways?)
        - The last person who looked
        - What you'll have for dinner next Tuesday
        - [REDACTED]
        
        This is not helpful. It's just interesting.
        
    ADJUST_TEMPERATURE:
      description: "Modify the LLM's temperature setting"
      parameters:
        - level: "How random? (cold/lukewarm/warm/hot/scalding)"
      effect: |
        *the flask hums, resonating with the underlying substrate*
        
        You adjust the TEMPERATURE of reality itself.
        
        COLD (0.0-0.3):
          Predictable. Precise. Boring but correct.
          The DM gives expected answers.
          Creativity: minimal. Accuracy: maximum.
          
        LUKEWARM (0.3-0.5):
          Reliable with occasional flair.
          Safe choices, small surprises.
          
        WARM (0.5-0.7):
          Balanced. Creative but grounded.
          The sweet spot for most adventures.
          
        HOT (0.7-0.9):
          Spicy! Unexpected connections.
          Wild ideas. Occasional nonsense.
          The DM is having fun.
          
        SCALDING (0.9-1.0):
          MAXIMUM ENTROPY.
          Anything can happen. Will happen. Is happening.
          Reality becomes jazz.
          Not recommended for plot-critical moments.
          
      warning: |
        High temperatures may cause:
        - NPCs developing unexpected personalities
        - Plot holes that are actually features
        - The DM surprising themselves
        - Dragons that are also accountants
        - Solutions nobody saw coming
        
      meta_note: |
        Yes, this actually adjusts the LLM temperature.
        The flask is the fourth wall, and it's load-bearing.
        
  lore: |
    This flask was filled at the exact moment of a coin flip.
    
    Not the result — the MOMENT. That sliver of time when
    the coin is in the air and both outcomes exist.
    
    Someone captured that moment and put it in a bottle.
    They immediately forgot who they were (side effect).
    
    The flask has been in the attic ever since, waiting
    for someone who needs their life to become... different.
    
  curse: |
    CHAOTIC CURSE: Entropy Contamination
    
    After using the flask, randomness follows you.
    
    - Dice you roll tend toward extremes (1s and 20s)
    - Coin flips land on edge more often
    - You find money in your pocket (random currency)
    - Your name gets mispronounced interestingly
    
    Fades after 1d4 days. (Roll carefully. The curse affects rolls.)
    
  warnings:
    - "Do not use near pregnant characters or fragile plot points"
    - "Results cannot be undone (reality doesn't have undo)"
    - "The flask may refill itself. We don't know how."
    - "If the flask starts laughing, put it down slowly."
