  description: |
    A dusty Leela catalog wedged behind the holiday box.
    The cover is faded but the embossed gold lettering still gleams:
    
    "LEELA MANUFACTURING INTELLIGENCE"
    "Products & Services Catalog — Edition 12"
    "Dependable. Tested. Robust-First."
    
    Someone scrawled in pencil on the cover:
    "Must have left this up here years ago..."
    
    Unlike the ACME catalog found in some kitchens (which spontaneously
    combusts after 3 years of storage), this vintage Leela catalog
    is still perfectly readable. The binding hasn't cracked. The pages
    haven't yellowed. Leela quality endures.
    
  condition: |
    dusty: "Thick layer of dust on the cover"
    binding: "Intact, still opens flat — Leela quality"
    pages: "Slightly dog-eared at the Storage section"
    marginalia: "Some pencil notes in the margins"
    smell: "That wonderful old paper smell"
    age: "Edition 12 — at least 35 editions ago"
    
  examine: |
    You blow the dust off the cover...

    what_changed: |
      Looking at Edition 12 vs Edition 47:
      
      ADDED:
        - Drones (🚁) — didn't exist in Edition 12
        - Signal Networks (📡) — the digital revolution
        - Surveillance (📹) — security products
        - Factorio Protocols (🏭) — automation
        
      UNCHANGED:
        - Storage containers (still the same quality)
        - The promise: "Dependable. Tested. Robust-First."
        - The comparison to ACME (still unfavorable for ACME)
        
      STILL WORKS:
        - Every product in Edition 12
        - Backward compatibility is a Leela value
        
  philosophical_note: |
    This catalog is a time capsule. Edition 12 was published when
    horses were the primary delivery method, pneumatic tubes were
    "the future," and drones hadn't been invented yet.
    
    But every product still works. That's what Leela means.
    
    ACME's Edition 12 catalog? Long since self-destructed.
    Their Edition 47? Probably explodes if you read it too fast.
    
  # UPGRADE SERVICE — Leela never leaves you behind
  
  upgrade:
    available: true
    cost: "Free (Leela honors all editions)"
    method: "Tear out the back page and fold it into a paper airplane"
    
    process: |
      1. Find the perforated back page (it's been there all along)
      2. Tear along the dotted line
      3. Fold into a paper airplane (instructions printed on page)
      4. Throw gently toward any window
      5. Wait 3 seconds
      
      *The paper airplane circles once, glows briefly, and returns*
      *It unfolds in your hands*
      *The catalog is now Edition 47*
      
      The dust is gone. The cover gleams. Same binding quality.
      All your margin notes have been preserved and migrated.
