# === THE PIE MENU DESIGN ===

pie_menu_analysis:
  
  significance: |
    The pie menu IS The Sims. Don Hopkins brought pie menus
    to Maxis from his work at Sun. Will Wright made them
    the primary interaction system. This image captures
    that heritage perfectly.
    
  options_analysis:
    dangerous:
      - "Summon Monster" — the classic ACME backfire waiting to happen
      
    safe:
      - "Close Book" — wisdom is knowing when to stop
      - "Hide Under Mattress" — the coward's archive
      
    impossible:
      - "Burn" — no fireplace in the attic (grayed)
      - "Banish" — needs a target first
      
    intriguing:
      - "Examine Marginalia" — the warnings matter!
      - "Bind Creature" — implies something to bind
      
  menu_philosophy: |
    Everything you CAN do, right there.
    Gray for unavailable. Submenu for depth.
    No hunting through menus. No hidden commands.
    THE SIMS PIE MENU IS UX PERFECTION.

# === MINING NOTES ===

mining_notes: |
  A PERFECT SIMS 1 SCREENSHOT.
  
  This captures everything that made The Sims magical:
  
  1. THE PIE MENU
     - Radial options on the Monster Manual
     - "Summon Monster" as an option (!)
     - "Hide Under Mattress" (brilliant)
     - Classic white segments with black text
  
  2. THE CONFUSED SPACE PIRATE
     - Full regalia: tricorn, coat, eyepatch
     - Green plumbob (selected Sim)
     - Thought bubble with question mark
     - The Sims character proportions
  
  3. THE UI
     - Classic blue control panel
     - Needs bars with Simlish labels
     - Portrait showing the eyepatch!
     - § 560 simoleons
  
  4. THE ATMOSPHERE
     - Warm Sims 1 lighting
     - Chunky pre-rendered graphics
     - Object labels floating
     - That year 2000 feeling
  
  The generator understood:
  - Sims 1 is NOT Sims 4 — different era, different look
  - Pie menus are CENTRAL to The Sims identity
  - Space pirate + attic + cursed book = peak Sims chaos
  
  Will Wright would approve.
  Don Hopkins would recognize the pie menu.
  
  "Sul Sul!"
