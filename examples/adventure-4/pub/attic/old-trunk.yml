  description: |
    A battered steamer trunk bearing the faded Leela Quality seal 
    from an earlier era. Plastered with travel stickers from places 
    that may not exist anymore.
    
    The brass clasps are green with age but still work perfectly.
    Leela built them to last. They lasted.

    The Leela seal endures. The trunk endures.
    The memories inside... also endure.
