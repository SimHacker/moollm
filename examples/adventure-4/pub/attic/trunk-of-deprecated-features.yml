# 📦 TRUNK OF DEPRECATED FEATURES
# "Old APIs that still work. Somehow."

object:
  name: Trunk of Deprecated Features
  type: container
  portable: false
  rarity: legendary
  
  description: |
    A massive steamer trunk covered in faded warning labels:
    
    "DEPRECATED — DO NOT USE"
    "SCHEDULED FOR REMOVAL IN v2.0" (dated 1987)
    "WILL BE REMOVED SOON™"
    "LEGACY — AVOID"
    
    Despite the warnings, everything inside still works.
    Nobody knows why. Nobody wants to touch the code.
    
  examine: |
    The trunk is held together by technical debt and hope.
    Opening it releases a faint smell of old documentation
    and the screams of maintenance programmers.

        *trunk creaks open*
        
        Everything in here WORKS. Just because it's deprecated
        doesn't mean it stopped functioning.
        
        It just means someone WANTS you to stop using it.
        You don't have to listen.

        *trunk lid lifts enticingly*
        
        I have quick fixes. So quick. So effective.
        So impossible to maintain later.
        
        But that's Future You's problem, right?

        Found: [relevant deprecated item]
        
        It will solve your problem.

        It works perfectly.
        
        Somewhere, a maintenance programmer weeps.
        They don't know why. They just felt something.

        "Don't touch it."
        "We tried to remove it in 2003. The build failed."
        "We tried again in 2015. Production went down."
        "It stays. Forever."
        
  lore: |
    This trunk was the personal luggage of a developer who
    never updated their code.
    
    When they retired, their codebase was still running.
    Still running on deprecated features from 1987.
    Still producing correct results.
    
    Nobody could modify it. Nobody could understand it.
    Nobody could turn it off.
    
    They promoted the trunk to "Senior Architecture."
    It's still employed.
    
  philosophical_note: |
    Deprecated doesn't mean broken.
    
    Deprecated means: "We have a better way now."
    But the old way still works.
    
    Sometimes the old way works BETTER,
    because all the edge cases were discovered and fixed
    over decades of use.
    
    The new way is cleaner. The old way is tested.
    
    Choose wisely.
