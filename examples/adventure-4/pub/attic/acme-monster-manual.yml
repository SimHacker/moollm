# THE COLLECTION

collection:
  
  description: |
    The ACME Monster Manual is not a book. It is an ENCYCLOPEDIA.
    
    Leather-bound volumes stretching across an entire wall of the attic.
    Each spine embossed in gold with a monster's name. Each volume
    containing EXHAUSTIVE documentation of a single creature type.
    
    The full collection includes:
    - 847 primary volumes (A-Z, plus special characters)
    - 312 supplemental volumes (errata, addenda, retractions)
    - 89 "Apology Editions" (for monsters who complained)
    - 47 volumes that spontaneously appeared (nobody wrote them)
    - 1 blank volume (for creatures that don't exist YET)
    
    The shelf sags under the weight of categorized terror.
    
  physical_presence: |
    An entire wall of the attic is taken up by THE SHELF.
    
    Massive wooden bookcases, floor to ceiling, extending into
    shadows where the roof slants. Ladder on rails for reaching
    the upper volumes. Dust on most spines — but some volumes
    show heavy use. Claw marks. Burn marks. Tear stains.
    
    A small reading nook with a worn chair. A table with
    ink stains and scattered bookmarks. The Recursive Imp's
    permanent workstation.
    
  scope: |
    Every monster in existence — and several that don't exist yet —
    has its own dedicated volume. Each volume contains:
    
    - Full-page illustration (often disputed by the subject)
    - 47+ pages of statistics, variants, and subspecies  
    - Behavioral analysis with footnotes
    - Weakness catalog (heavily redacted in some copies)
    - True name etymology (encrypted in Appendix Z)
    - Historical sightings and incident reports
    - Summoning instructions with safety warnings
    - Binding protocols (rarely work as documented)
    - First-person accounts from survivors (short section)
    - First-person accounts from non-survivors (longer section)
    - Fine print (VERY long section)
    - Marginalia from previous readers (often panicked)
    
  editions: |
    Each volume has multiple editions:
    
    - 1st Edition: "We thought this was a good idea"
      True names: Often misspelled (monsters claim this invalidates them)
      
    - 2nd Edition: "Corrections after the first wave of lawsuits"
      True names: Corrected but now encrypted in Appendix Z
      
    - 3rd Edition: "The monsters found out and demanded revisions"
      True names: "Sanitized" — split across footnotes, some removed entirely
      
    - 4th Edition: "Compromise between ACME legal and monster unions"
      True names: Present but encoded with monster-specific ciphers
      
    - 5th Edition: "Current — now with 40% more fine print"
      True names: Encrypted; cipher keys hidden in OTHER volumes
      (The Imp's key is in the LICH volume. The liches find this hilarious.)
      
    - REDACTED Edition: "Exists. Don't ask about it."
      True names: PLAINTEXT. COMPLETE. UNENCRYPTED.
      Every monster is hunting copies of this edition.
      Rumored copies exist in: the BASEMENT, the WUMPUS LAIR, and "somewhere
      the liches won't look."
      
    - MONSTER'S OWN COPY Edition: "What the monster WANTS you to read"
      True names: "NICE TRY" or similar. Not accurate.

# THE IMP MANUAL

imp_manual:
  
  volume_name: "USERS GUIDE TO THE TERMINAL IMP"
  full_title: |
    USERS GUIDE TO THE TERMINAL IMP
    (ACME MONSTER MANUAL: IMP — Complete Edition)
  spine_label: "TERMINAL IMP"
  volume_number: "Vol. CCCXLVII"
  color: "Deep crimson leather with gold imp silhouette"
  
  # HISTORICAL NOTE: The title is a tribute to the real BBN publication
  # "USERS GUIDE TO THE TERMINAL IMP" — the ARPANET IMP/TIP/TAC manual.
  # Told you how to hack into the ARPANET the way an imp would love to.
  # TIP-to-TIP links. Session takeovers. Deep voodoo old skuul wizardry.
  # The fantasy imp and the network imp share more than a name.
  
  cover: |
    The cover shows a detailed illustration of an imp —
    wings spread, tail curled, expression somewhere between
    mischievous and legally liable.
    
    Above the illustration, in gold serif lettering:
    "USERS GUIDE TO THE TERMINAL IMP"
    
    The Recursive Imp insists the cover illustration is
    "close but the horns are WRONG."
    
    Below the illustration:
    "COMPLETE DOCUMENTATION OF IMP-KIND"
    "Including: Greater Imps, Lesser Imps, Self-Aware Variants"
    "TIP-to-TIP Links | Session Takeover Protocols | True Names"
    "547 Pages | 89 Diagrams | 1 True Name Per Entry"
    
  arpanet_connection: |
    The title is no coincidence.
    
    In the before-times, BBN published "USERS GUIDE TO THE TERMINAL IMP"
    — documentation for the Interface Message Processor, the node that
    connected hosts to the ARPANET. It described how to:
    
    - Establish TIP-to-TIP links (peer connections!)
    - Take over other users' sessions (session hijacking!)
    - Route packets through the network (message passing!)
    - Debug connection issues (exception handling!)
    
    Deep voodoo. Old skuul magic. The kind of wizardry an imp would love.
    
    When the ACME Encyclopedia was compiled, whoever wrote the IMP volume
    chose the same title. Whether this was homage, prophecy, or recursive
    destiny remains unclear. The Recursive Imp claims he inspired BOTH
    documents. He's probably lying. Probably.

      Full-page illustration of the Recursive Imp himself.
      Stats, weaknesses, true name, everything.
      
      This is the page he reads every day.

# THE SHELF IN THE ATTIC

the_shelf:
  
  description: |
    The entire west wall of the attic is THE SHELF.
    
    Floor to ceiling, extending into the shadows where the roof
    slants down. Hundreds of volumes, spines facing out, each
    one a different creature's complete documentation.
    
    A rolling ladder on brass rails allows access to upper shelves.
    The Recursive Imp rarely uses it — he mostly stays near
    the I-section.
    
  atmosphere: |
    Dust motes drift between the volumes. The smell of old leather
    and ancient ink. Some spines glow faintly. Some whisper when
    you're not looking directly at them.
    
    The shelf feels HEAVY. Not just physically — it contains the
    documented weight of every monster that ever was or will be.
    Knowledge is power. This much knowledge is terrifying.
    
  notable_features:
    - "Rolling ladder on brass rails (squeaks ominously)"
    - "Reading nook with worn velvet chair (Imp's territory)"
    - "Small table with ink stains and scattered bookmarks"
    - "Gaps where volumes have been 'borrowed' (never returned)"
    - "One shelf that's always slightly too warm (Dragon section)"
    - "One shelf that's always slightly too cold (Undead section)"
    - "One shelf you can never quite look at directly (Eldritch section)"
    
  the_imp_section: |
    The I-section is well-worn.
    
    The IMP MANUAL sits at eye level (for an imp standing on the
    reading chair). The spine is cracked from centuries of use.
    A permanent bookmark made of ancient silk marks page 47.
    
    Other I-volumes nearby:
    - INCUBUS (sealed with warning tape)
    - IFRIT (slightly smoking)
    - INVISIBLE STALKER (may or may not be there)
    
    The Recursive Imp considers this HIS section. Visitors may
    browse, but page 47 is... personal.

# THE ACME MONSTER FORMULA

monster_formula:
  pattern: |
    Every ACME monster entry includes:
    
    1. IMPRESSIVE DESCRIPTION
       What it does, why it's scary/useful
       
    2. FULL-PAGE ILLUSTRATION
       Often disputed by the subject ("The horns are WRONG")
       
    3. STAT BLOCKS
       47+ pages of detailed statistics
       
    4. HIDDEN WEAKNESS
       Something ironic that defeats it easily
       (Redacted in Monster's Own Copy editions)
       
    5. BACKFIRE CHANCE (20-70%)
       Higher = more powerful but riskier
       (Always contested by the monster)
       
    6. IRONIC FAILURE MODE
       What goes wrong when it backfires
       
    7. TRUE NAME
       For banishing. Encrypted in Appendix Z.
       Often embarrassing when decrypted.
       
    8. FINE PRINT
       At least 47 pages per creature
       
  note: |
    The Recursive Imp has memorized the formula.
    He disputes his own backfire chance.
    He's torn out his own weakness section.
    He refuses to discuss his true name.

# FINE PRINT

fine_print: |
  ACME Corporation assumes no liability for:
  - Monsters eating summoners
  - Monsters developing opinions about their entries
  - Monsters forming unions to dispute their documentation
  - Monsters reading their own volumes
  - Existential crises resulting from self-documentation
  - Recursive loops of monsters reading about monsters
  - The feeling that maybe YOU'RE in a volume somewhere
  
  ACME: "What Could Possibly Go Wrong?"™
  
  Note: The "Apology Editions" were mandated after several
  creatures filed formal complaints. ACME maintains the
  original entries were accurate. The creatures disagree.
  This disagreement continues.
