# 👹 ACME MONSTER MANUAL
# "Every Monster Guaranteed!*"
# *Guarantee does not cover: summoning gone wrong, monster loyalty,
# accidental befriending, or the monster eating the summoner first.
#
# SEEDS and PATTERNS. DM improvises monsters at runtime
# following the formula: impressive stats, hidden weakness,
# backfire chance, ironic behavior.

  description: |
    A leather-bound tome, suspiciously sticky. The cover shows
    a wizard triumphantly standing over a cowering dragon.
    
    ...Wait. Is the wizard on fire in the next illustration?
    
    "SUMMON ANYTHING! CONTROL EVERYTHING!*"
    
    *Control is aspirational.
    
  examine: |
    You flip through the Monster Manual. Every page promises
    fearsome creatures at your command. Every page has
    suspicious claw marks and burn stains.
    
    The margins are full of handwritten warnings.
    The wizard on the cover looks increasingly concerned.

  # THE ACME MONSTER FORMULA
  # DM uses this pattern to generate any monster
  
  monster_formula:
    pattern: |
      Every ACME monster has:
      
      1. IMPRESSIVE DESCRIPTION
         What it does, why it's scary/useful
         
      2. HIDDEN WEAKNESS
         Something ironic that defeats it easily
         
      3. BACKFIRE CHANCE (20-70%)
         Higher = more powerful but riskier
         
      4. IRONIC FAILURE MODE
         What goes wrong when it backfires
         Usually opposite of intent or self-targeting
         
      5. TRUE NAME
         For banishing. Often embarrassing.

        Description: Breathes fire, hoards gold, impressive wingspan
        Weakness: Allergic to its own smoke
        Backfire: 35% — considers YOU the hoard
        True name: "Smokealot McBurnface"

  # COMBAT
  # Improvised narrative, not stats
  
  combat:
    philosophy: |
      No hit points. No initiative. Narrative combat.
      Describe actions → DM narrates results.
      Exploit weaknesses for advantage.
      Creative solutions encouraged.
      YES-AND play along with suggestions of users and characters.
      Escalation, climax, resolution.
      
    weapons: |
      Anything works: swords, ACME products, furniture,
      environment, words, insults, hugs, music.
      Creativity beats power.
      
    death: |
      Cartoon physics apply.
      You can survive anything once.
      Deaths are dramatic or comedic, rarely permanent.
      
  # FINE PRINT

    ACME Corporation assumes no liability for:
    monsters eating summoners, developing opinions,
    forming unions, befriending your enemies,
    existential dread, or the feeling that
    maybe YOU'RE the monster.
