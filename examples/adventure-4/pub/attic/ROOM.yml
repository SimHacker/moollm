  theme: storage
  
  tagline: "Dusty boxes, forgotten treasures, weird buffs, Leela quality."
  
  description: |
    A cramped, dusty attic with slanted ceilings and exposed beams.
    Cobwebs in the corners. That unmistakable attic smell of old
    wood, mothballs, ancient leather, and forgotten things.
    
    The west wall is dominated by THE SHELF — floor to ceiling
    bookcases containing the complete ACME Monster Manual Encyclopedia.
    Hundreds of leather-bound volumes, each one a different creature's
    complete documentation. More shelves than Britannica. More editions
    than Who's Who in Hell. A rolling ladder on brass rails provides
    access to upper volumes.
    
    In the I-section, a small reading nook: worn velvet chair, ink-
    stained table, scattered bookmarks. The Recursive Imp's territory.
    He's probably there now, reading page 47 of the IMP MANUAL.
    
    Boxes and trunks stacked haphazardly around the other walls.
    Old furniture draped in sheets. Things that didn't fit anywhere
    else ended up here — including an imp who found his own volume.
    
    Slanted roof beams disappear into shadow. Dust motes dance in
    shafts of light from a grimy dormer window.
    
    A hatch in the ceiling leads to the rooftop.
    A ladder in the floor leads down to the hotel landing.
    
    A cardboard sign, hand-lettered:
    
    > "ADVENTURER'S STORAGE"
    > "Take what you need. Leave what you find."
    > "Mind the edge cases."
    > "Page 47 is PRIVATE." — R.I.
    
    Something skitters in the darkness. Probably mice. Probably.
    Or maybe just the Recursive Imp, looking for a bookmark.

      atmosphere: |
        Some spines glow faintly. Some whisper when you're not
        looking directly at them. The shelf feels HEAVY — not just
        physically. It contains the documented weight of every
        monster that ever was or will be.

  atmosphere: |
    Dusty. Cramped. Full of potential.
    
    The kind of place where you find exactly what you need
    if you rummage long enough. Also spiders.
    
    Light comes from the hatch above and cracks in the eaves.
    Dust motes float in the beams.
    
    The air smells of old paper, mothballs, and mystery.
