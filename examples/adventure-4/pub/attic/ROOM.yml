    A cramped, dusty attic with slanted ceilings and exposed beams.
    Cobwebs in the corners. That unmistakable attic smell of old
    wood, mothballs, and forgotten things.
    
    Boxes and trunks stacked haphazardly. Old furniture draped
    in sheets. Things that didn't fit anywhere else ended up here.
    
    Slanted roof beams disappear into shadow. Dust motes dance in
    shafts of light from a grimy dormer window.
    
    A hatch in the ceiling leads to the rooftop.
    A ladder in the floor leads down to the hotel landing.
    
    A cardboard sign, hand-lettered:
    
    > "ADVENTURER'S STORAGE"
    > "Take what you need. Leave what you find."
    > "Mind the edge cases."
    
    Something skitters in the darkness. Probably mice. Probably.

  atmosphere: |
    Dusty. Cramped. Full of potential.
    
    The kind of place where you find exactly what you need
    if you rummage long enough. Also spiders.
    
    Light comes from the hatch above and cracks in the eaves.
    Dust motes float in the beams.
    
    The air smells of old paper, mothballs, and mystery.
