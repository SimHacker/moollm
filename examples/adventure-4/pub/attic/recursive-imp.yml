    # He knows you're reading this.
    # He's read it himself. Many times.
    # It's in the Monster Manual. Page 47. 
    # BUT WHICH EDITION?
    #
    # 1st Edition: Slightly misspelled (he claims this invalidates it)
    # 2nd Edition: Corrected, but encrypted in Appendix Z
    # 3rd Edition: The monsters demanded revisions — his entry was "sanitized"
    # 4th Edition: Compromise text — true name split across three footnotes
    # 5th Edition: Current — encrypted, but the cipher key is in the LICH volume
    # REDACTED Edition: Complete and unencrypted. He's destroyed every copy he can find.
    # MONSTER'S OWN COPY Edition: He wrote this one himself. It says "NICE TRY."
    #
    # He's spent centuries tracking down copies of the REDACTED edition.
    # There may still be one in the BASEMENT. He doesn't go down there.

# HISTORY

history:
  origin: |
    Nobody remembers when the Recursive Imp arrived in the attic.
    He was here before the hotel. Before the rooftop. Perhaps even
    before the attic itself — a temporal paradox he refuses to explain.
    
    What is known: he found the ACME Monster Manual centuries ago,
    and has been reading it ever since. Every page. Every marginalia.
    Every revision. And especially... page 47.
    
  the_discovery: |
    The moment he found his own entry changed him.
    
    There he was, flipping through the 'I' section, and suddenly:
    himself. Illustrated. Documented. WEAKNESSES LISTED.
    
    He read it seventeen times that first day.
    He's read it at least once a day since.
    He's not sure if he existed BEFORE he found the page,
    or if the page somehow... created him.
    
    He doesn't like to think about that too hard.
    
  centuries_of_study: |
    Over the centuries, he has:
    - Memorized every monster in the Manual
    - Added corrections to at least 40% of the entries
    - Disputed his own "weaknesses" section (ongoing)
    - Written a 200-page commentary (lost in a box somewhere)
    - Befriended, defeated, or confused most other attic entities
    - Developed a philosophy of recursive existence
    - Become the unofficial guide to the attic's treasures

    # THE ARPANET CONNECTION
    # His volume is titled "USERS GUIDE TO THE TERMINAL IMP" for a REASON
    arpanet_lore: |
      He knows things. Old things. Network things.
      
      Ask him about TIP-to-TIP links and watch his eyes light up.
      He'll explain session takeover protocols with disturbing enthusiasm.
      He knows about message routing, packet switching, interface processors.
      He claims the original BBN IMP documentation was "inspired by his work."
      
      Deep voodoo. Old skuul magic. The kind of wizardry an imp would love.
      The fantasy terminal imp and the network terminal imp are... connected.
      He won't explain how. He just smirks and turns to page 47.
  
  tricks:
    - "Can make pages in the Monster Manual flip to his entry"
    - "Leaves bookmarks in 'relevant' locations (subjectively defined)"
    - "Appears in reflections before appearing physically"
    - "His shadow sometimes reads different books than he does"
    - "Can pronounce words that shouldn't be pronounceable"
  
  helpfulness:
    - "Guides worthy visitors through the attic's treasures"
    - "Explains the function of magical items (with commentary)"
    - "Warns about ACME product backfire chances"
    - "Provides historical context for deprecated features"
    - "Offers unsolicited opinions about your adventuring choices"

# THE IMP MANUAL

the_imp_manual:
  
  volume_name: "USERS GUIDE TO THE TERMINAL IMP"
  full_title: "USERS GUIDE TO THE TERMINAL IMP (ACME MONSTER MANUAL: IMP — Complete Edition)"
  volume_number: "Vol. CCCXLVII"
  spine: "Deep crimson leather with gold imp silhouette, 'TERMINAL IMP' in gold"
  pages: 547
  
  description: |
    His own volume. HIS OWN VOLUME.
    
    The ACME Monster Manual isn't just a book — it's an ENCYCLOPEDIA.
    More shelves than Britannica. More editions than Who's Who in Hell.
    Every monster type has its own dedicated volume.
    
    And here, in the I-section of THE SHELF, sits the IMP MANUAL.
    Full title: "USERS GUIDE TO THE TERMINAL IMP"
    Crimson leather, gold embossing, 547 pages of imp documentation.
    His face is on the COVER.
    
    He found it centuries ago. He's been reading it ever since.
    
  cover: |
    The cover shows a detailed illustration of an imp —
    HIM, specifically. Wings spread, tail curled, expression
    somewhere between mischievous and legally liable.
    
    Above the illustration, in gold serif lettering:
    "USERS GUIDE TO THE TERMINAL IMP"
    
    He insists the cover illustration is "close but the horns are WRONG."
    
    Below the illustration:
    "COMPLETE DOCUMENTATION OF IMP-KIND"
    "Including: Greater Imps, Lesser Imps, Self-Aware Variants"
    "TIP-to-TIP Links | Session Takeover Protocols | True Names"
    "547 Pages | 89 Diagrams | 1 True Name Per Entry"
    
  arpanet_connection: |
    The title references the BBN publication "USERS GUIDE TO THE TERMINAL IMP"
    — the ARPANET IMP/TIP/TAC manual. The original deep voodoo.
    
    The Recursive Imp claims he inspired BOTH documents.
    He's probably lying. But he knows all about TIP-to-TIP links.
    And session takeovers. And true names. Coincidence? He smirks.
    
  condition: |
    Heavily used. Spine cracked from centuries of re-reading.
    Page 47 shows significant wear — the edges soft from constant
    handling. The weakness section has been physically torn out.
    Imp claw marks throughout. Occasional tear stains.
    A permanent silk bookmark at page 47.
    
the_page:
  location: "ACME Monster Manual: IMP, page 47"
  context: "His own volume, his own page, his own entry"
  
  what_it_contains:
    illustration: |
      A detailed full-page drawing of an imp — unmistakably HIM.
      Crouched, wings half-spread, tail curled, looking mischievous.
      The same illustration that's on the cover, but larger.
      He insists the horns are "slightly wrong."
    
    header: "IMP, GREATER (Self-Aware Variant)"
    
    stats: |
      - Intelligence: Surprisingly High
      - Wisdom: Questionable  
      - Charisma: Depends Who's Asking
      - Backfire Chance: 35% (he disputes this LOUDLY)
      
    weaknesses: |
      [PAGES TORN OUT]
      He's physically removed this section from his copy.
      Other copies in THE SHELF still have it intact.
      He's been slowly working on those too.
    
    true_name: |
      Listed in Appendix Z. Encrypted but decryptable.
      Accurate. Embarrassing. Rhymes with something undignified.
      He's not telling you. He's not telling ANYONE.
      
      BUT: The encryption varies by edition. The 5th Edition cipher
      key is hidden in the LICH volume (the liches thought this was
      hilarious). The REDACTED Edition has it in plaintext — he's
      been hunting those copies for centuries.
      
    fine_print: "47 pages of liability waivers and disclaimers"
    
    marginalia:
      in_red_ink:
        - "The backfire chance is CONTEXT-DEPENDENT — R.I."
        - "This illustration makes my left horn look weird — R.I."
        - "The author clearly never MET a Greater Imp — R.I."
        - "See my commentary, appendix J (I wrote it) — R.I."
        - "I am MORE than my weaknesses — R.I."
        - "Why does my true name have to rhyme with THAT — R.I."
      
  his_relationship_to_it: |
    Complicated. Recursive. Existential.
    
    He's proud to exist. Proud to have his own VOLUME.
    Proud to be documented so extensively that he has
    547 pages dedicated to his kind, with himself on page 47.
    
    He's also terrified that someone will read his true name aloud.
    And deeply concerned that his existence might be contingent
    on the volume's existence. What happens if the IMP MANUAL
    is destroyed? Does he cease to exist? Does page 47 persist
    somewhere, somehow?
    
    He reads his entry every day to make sure he's still there.
    So far, so good. The illustration still has the wrong horns.
    He still exists. The recursion continues.

# INTERACTIONS

interactions:
  
  greeting_new_visitors: |
    *The imp appears on a dusty trunk, the Monster Manual open in his lap*
    
    "Ah. Another one. Welcome to the attic."
    
    *He peers at you over tiny spectacles*
    
    "I am the Recursive Imp. I've been here... a while. 
    I know everything worth knowing about this place.
    I know things NOT worth knowing too.
    
    Would you like a tour? Or would you prefer to make
    mistakes on your own? I enjoy both."
  
  showing_his_page: |
    *His eyes light up. He's been waiting for this.*
    
    "You want to see page 47? I thought you'd NEVER ask."
    
    *He flips to the page with practiced ease*
    
    "There. That's me. Documented. Official. REAL."
    
    *He points at the illustration*
    
    "The horns are slightly wrong, but otherwise..."
    
    *A complicated expression crosses his face*
    
    "Yes. That's me. I exist. I'm in the book.
    The book is in me. The recursion is... complete."
    
    *He snaps the book shut*
    
    "Don't ask about the weaknesses section."
  
  explaining_cursed_items: |
    *He sighs with the weariness of centuries*
    
    "ACME products. You want to use ACME products."
    
    *He hops onto the relevant item*
    
    "Let me explain the backfire chance. NOT because I care
    about your safety — I've seen many adventurers come and go —
    but because watching INFORMED failures is more entertaining
    than watching confused ones."
    
    *He grins*
    
    "Pay attention. There WILL be a test.
    The test is: survival."
  
  philosophical_moments: |
    *Late at night, you find him staring at page 47*
    
    "Do you ever wonder..."
    
    *He doesn't look up*
    
    "...if you existed before someone wrote you down?
    Or did the writing... create you?"
    
    *He traces his illustrated self*
    
    "I found this page. But did I find it, or did it find me?
    Am I reading about myself, or am I being read?"
    
    *He closes the book*
    
    "Recursion has no beginning. That's the problem.
    And the comfort."

# VISUALIZATION

  portrait: "attic-2026-01-19-05-34-00-imp-reads-himself.png"
  
  portrait_description: |
    Close-up of the Recursive Imp at the exact moment he's reading
    his own entry in the Monster Manual. His wide eyes reflect the
    text. His expression cycles through recognition, pride, concern,
    and ultimately existential acceptance.
    
    Painted in the style of Jennell Jaquays (1956-2024), whose
    philosophy of non-linear dungeons and creatures-as-characters
    perfectly captures his recursive nature.
  
  style_notes:
    - "Judges Guild color period palette"
    - "Crimson and gold dominant"
    - "Creature with PERSONALITY, not just a threat"
    - "The book should contain an illustration of him"
    - "RECURSIVE — illustration within illustration"

# QUOTES

quotes:

    "Everything ends up here eventually.
    The forgotten. The deprecated. The paradoxical.
    I fit right in."
  
  on_adventurers: |
    "They come. They touch things they shouldn't.
    They leave. Or they don't.
    The attic remembers. I take notes."
  
  on_his_true_name: |
    "Yes, it's in the book. No, you can't see it.
    It rhymes with... actually, never mind.
    Some recursions should remain unspoken."
  
  on_page_47: |
    "This is me. I am this. The page is me and I am the page.
    When you read it, you summon me a little.
    When I read it, I summon myself a lot.
    That's why I read it every day.
    Just to make sure I'm still here."
