# 🕸️ The Dusty Attic

> *"Where forgotten things wait to be remembered."*

**Dust, shadows, and infinite storage capacity.**

---

## 🌅 Overview

Slanted roof beams disappear into shadow. Dust motes dance in shafts of light from a grimy dormer window. Forgotten furniture draped in sheets, stacked crates, trunks of who-knows-what.

The air smells of old paper, mothballs, and mystery. Something skitters in the darkness. Probably mice. *Probably.*

This is the pub's attic — not to be confused with the [Adventurer's Storage](../rooms/attic/) in the hotel. This is where the building itself keeps its memories.

## 🔝 The Skylight

A hatch in the ceiling leads to the rooftop terrace. On clear nights, starlight streams down. On rainy nights, you can hear the drops on the glass.

The skylight is always slightly ajar. For ventilation. Or for something else.

*"Every attic tells a story. This one tells several, all at once, and some of them contradict."*
