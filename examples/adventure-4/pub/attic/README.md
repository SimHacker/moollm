# 🕸️ The Dusty Attic — Adventurer's Storage

> *"Take what you need. Leave what you find."*
> *"Mind the edge cases."*

**Dusty boxes, forgotten treasures, weird buffs, Leela quality.**

---

## 🌅 Overview

A cramped, dusty attic with slanted ceilings and exposed beams. Cobwebs in the corners. That unmistakable attic smell of old wood, mothballs, and forgotten things.

Boxes and trunks stacked haphazardly. Old furniture draped in sheets. Things that didn't fit anywhere else ended up here.

Slanted roof beams disappear into shadow. Dust motes dance in shafts of light from a grimy dormer window. The air smells of old paper, mothballs, and mystery. Something skitters in the darkness. Probably mice. *Probably.*

A hatch in the ceiling leads to the rooftop.
A ladder in the floor leads down to the hotel landing.

## 💡 Atmosphere

Dusty. Cramped. Full of potential.

The kind of place where you find exactly what you need if you rummage long enough. Also spiders.

Light comes from the hatch above and cracks in the eaves. Dust motes float in the beams.

## 🔝 The Skylight

A hatch in the ceiling leads to the rooftop terrace. On clear nights, starlight streams down. On rainy nights, you can hear the drops on the glass.

The skylight is always slightly ajar. For ventilation. Or for something else.
