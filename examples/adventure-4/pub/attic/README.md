# 🕸️ The Dusty Attic — Adventurer's Storage

> *"Take what you need. Leave what you find."*
> *"Mind the edge cases."*

**Dusty boxes, forgotten treasures, weird buffs, Leela quality.**

---

## 🌅 Overview

A cramped, dusty attic with slanted ceilings and exposed beams. Cobwebs in the corners. That unmistakable attic smell of old wood, mothballs, and forgotten things.

Boxes and trunks stacked haphazardly. Old furniture draped in sheets. Things that didn't fit anywhere else ended up here.

Slanted roof beams disappear into shadow. Dust motes dance in shafts of light from a grimy dormer window. The air smells of old paper, mothballs, and mystery. Something skitters in the darkness. Probably mice. *Probably.*

A hatch in the ceiling leads to the rooftop.
A ladder in the floor leads down to the hotel landing.

### The Recursive Imp

![The Recursive Imp reading about himself](attic-2026-01-19-05-34-00-imp-reads-himself.png)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Name** | The Recursive Imp (aliases: "Recurse", "Page 47") |
| **File** | [recursive-imp.yml](recursive-imp.yml) |
| **Location** | Attic (permanent) |
| **Specialty** | Monster Manual scholarship, self-reference |
| **Favorite Page** | 47 (his own entry) |

*"I've read my own entry. Have you read yours?"*

He's been here for centuries, reading everything in the attic. The Monster Manual is his favorite — especially page 47, which contains his own entry. He can be summoned by opening the book, saying "page 47" aloud, or asking an interesting question about the attic. He also appears on his own when he feels like it.

**Services offered:**
- Monster Manual consultation (with commentary)
- Attic tours (payment: interesting story)
- ACME product warnings (free — he enjoys this)
- Philosophical discourse (involuntary, late nights)

**Do NOT ask about:** His true name. His weaknesses. His "backfire chance" (he disputes the 35% figure).

## 👻 Summonable Familiars

| Familiar | Invocation | Tradition |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| **The Recursive Imp** | Open the Monster Manual / Say "page 47" | Self-referential scholarship — knows his own page by heart |
| **The Deprecated** | Open the Trunk | Old APIs that still work — backward compatibility wisdom |
| **Edge Case Eddie** | Peek in the Box | Things that shouldn't happen but do — undefined behavior lore |
| **The Dust Motes** | Watch them dance | The forgotten tradition — what was left behind |
| **The Skittering Thing** | Listen carefully | Probably mice. Definitely not anything else. |
| **The Sheet-Covered Thing** | Pull the sheet | ??? — nobody has done this yet |

*Inherits from: technical debt, forgotten features, attic lore, the things we don't talk about*

The skylight is always slightly ajar. For ventilation. Or for something else.
