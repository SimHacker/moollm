# 🕸️ The Dusty Attic

> *"Where forgotten things wait to be remembered."*

**Dust, shadows, and infinite storage capacity.**

---

## 🌅 Overview

Slanted roof beams disappear into shadow. Dust motes dance in shafts of light from a grimy dormer window. Forgotten furniture draped in sheets, stacked crates, trunks of who-knows-what.

The air smells of old paper, mothballs, and mystery. Something skitters in the darkness. Probably mice. *Probably.*

This is the pub's attic — not to be confused with the [Adventurer's Storage](../rooms/attic/) in the hotel. This is where the building itself keeps its memories.

## 👻 Summonable Familiars

| Familiar | Invocation | Tradition |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| **The Dust Motes** | Watch them dance | The forgotten tradition — what was left behind |
| **The Skittering Thing** | Listen carefully | Probably mice. Definitely not anything else. |
| **The Sheet-Covered Shape** | Pull the sheet | What's under there? Nobody remembers. |

*Inherits from: attic lore, forgotten things, the "I'll deal with it later" tradition*

## 📦 Leela Container Instances

All containers in the attic are **Leela-branded instances**, cloned from prototypes in the [Leela Manufacturing Storage Complex](../../street/lane-neverending/leela-manufacturing/storage/).

| Object | File | Prototype Source | Description |
|--------|------|------------------|-------------|
| **Grandmother's Trunk** | [old-trunk.yml](old-trunk.yml) | Aisle A: Wooden | 150+ years old, still works |

| **Dusty Mirror** | [dusty-mirror.yml](dusty-mirror.yml) | Aisle E: Display | Special Glass Division (discontinued) |

### Leela Vintage Quality

These containers show what **Leela Quality** means over time:
- **The trunk** — 150 years, still functional
- **The holiday box** — 50 seasons of attic storage, ornaments intact
- **The mirror** — 87 years, not a crack, shatter-resistant glass

*"Leela builds things that last. ACME builds things that... don't."*

## 🔝 The Skylight

A hatch in the ceiling leads to the rooftop terrace. On clear nights, starlight streams down. On rainy nights, you can hear the drops on the glass.

The skylight is always slightly ajar. For ventilation. Or for something else.

*"Every attic tells a story. This one tells several, all at once, and some of them contradict."*
