  A fantasy illustration CLOSE-UP in the distinctive style of Jennell Jaquays (1956-2024), her Judges Guild color period. Saturated fantasy colors, dramatic lighting.
  
  COMPOSITION: Intimate close-up of an imp's clawed hands gripping an open leather-bound spellbook, with his face visible above it, reacting to what he sees.
  
  THE BOOK PAGES: The open book shows an illustration of an IMP — the SAME imp we're looking at! A classic monster manual style entry with the creature in a pose, stat blocks, and text including WEAKNESSES and TRUE NAME sections. Handwritten marginalia in red ink.
  
  THE IMP'S REACTION: His face shows SHOCK and RECOGNITION. Eyes wide, mouth slightly open in disbelief. The dawning horror of self-awareness mixed with embarrassment. He just found his own entry! His expression says: I have a BACKFIRE CHANCE?!
  
  IMP FEATURES: Small impish demon, reddish-brown skin, pointed ears, small curved horns, bat-like wings partially visible behind, tail curling with agitation, clawed hands with articulated fingers, yellow-orange eyes wide with surprise, sharp little teeth visible.
  
  LIGHTING: Warm purple glow from the cursed book illuminates his face from below, creating dramatic shadows. His wide eyes reflect the book's glow. Dark attic shadows in background.
  
  MOOD: Recursive meta-humor. A monster reading about himself. Wonder, danger, and comedy. Creatures with personality — this imp is a CHARACTER having an existential moment.
  
  STYLE: Acrylic painting, Jennell Jaquays Judges Guild palette. Rich browns and warm oranges for imp, purple book glow, deep blue shadows. The book illustration should look like a classic monster manual entry — an illustration within the illustration. RECURSIVE. META. JAQUAYS.
