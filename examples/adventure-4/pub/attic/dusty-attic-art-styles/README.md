# 🎨 The Dusty Attic — Art Styles Gallery

> *"Take what you need. Leave what you find. Mind the edge cases."*

Seven legendary art styles render the same space: dusty beams, cursed items, the massive SHELF of the ACME Monster Manual Encyclopedia, and a Recursive Imp who found his own volume. From 1977 D&D Monster Manual illustrations to World of Warcraft screenshots to a tribute to Jennell Jaquays (1956-2024).

## 📖 The Story

The Dusty Attic holds the ACME Monster Manual Encyclopedia — more shelves than Britannica, more editions than Who's Who in Hell. Every monster type has its own dedicated volume. And one imp has been reading them all for centuries.

Seven images show this space through radically different artistic lenses:

1. **D&D Monster Manual (1977)** — Pen & ink crosshatching, sepia parchment, Gary Gygax would approve
2. **World of Warcraft** — Full UI chrome, tooltips, "Minor Curse: Probability Anxiety"  
3. **Ultima Online** — Gorgeous isometric pixels, Lord British would grant citizenship
4. **The Sims 1** — Confused space pirate, pie menu on cursed book, Will Wright energy
5. **Jennell Jaquays Tribute** — Judges Guild colors, non-linear composition, creatures with personality
6. **The Recursive Imp Close-Up** — He found page 47. His face is on the cover.
7. **The Library Tour** — First-person POV, your hands visible, the imp wants you to READ ALL OF THESE

The same attic. The same mysteries. Seven ways of seeing.

## 🎯 The Jaquays Legacy

*In memory of Jennell Jaquays (1956-2024) — Pioneer, artist, legend.*

Her name became a verb: "Jaquaysing the dungeon" means creating scenarios with myriad paths, non-linear and multi-solution. The tribute image doesn't just copy her style — it embodies her philosophy: multiple visual paths, nested spaces, creatures as characters.
