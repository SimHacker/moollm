# SYNTHESIZED PROMPT
# This prompt captures Jaquays' distinctive style
prompt: |
  A fantasy illustration in the distinctive style of Jennell Jaquays, 
  legendary fantasy artist (1956-2024), specifically her Judges Guild 
  color period (1978-1981). Acrylic painting with saturated fantasy 
  colors: deep blues for shadows, warm browns and ochres for aged wood, 
  golden highlights on magical items.
  
  THE SCENE: A cramped, atmospheric attic with slanted wooden ceilings 
  and exposed beams. Dust motes dance in light from a glowing iron 
  lantern hanging from the rafters. The lantern casts geometric 
  fractal light patterns on the walls.
  
  COMPOSITION: Non-linear, multi-focal - multiple visual paths through 
  the scene, like Jaquays' famous dungeon designs. Nested spaces 
  suggesting more beyond the frame.
  
  KEY ELEMENTS:
  - An old leather-bound spellbook lies open on a dusty trunk, glowing 
    with soft purple light
  - A small friendly IMP sits atop the book, reading with curiosity, 
    one claw tracing the illustrations
  - Brass and leather goggles with crystalline lenses rest nearby, 
    with floating golden percentage numbers drifting up like dust 
    motes: 73%, 12%, 7%
  - Wooden boxes labeled EDGE CASES spill paradoxical objects: a bottle 
    containing its own label, a map of itself
  - A large shape under a dusty white sheet in the corner - mysterious
  - Cobwebs in every corner, grimy dormer window with light filtering through
  - A hatch in the ceiling leads up, a ladder in the floor leads down - 
    the dungeon continues
  
  MOOD: Wonder and adventure, the promise of discovery. Whimsical 
  fantasy in the classic tabletop RPG tradition. The imp adds 
  personality - Jaquays' creatures always feel like characters, 
  not just monsters.
  
  STYLE: Professional fantasy illustration quality. Rich 
  crosshatch-influenced texturing. Cover-worthy composition. 
  Tribute to a legend.
