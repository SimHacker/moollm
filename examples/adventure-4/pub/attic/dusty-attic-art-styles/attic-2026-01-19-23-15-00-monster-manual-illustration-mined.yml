# MINING NOTES

mining_notes: |
  A PERFECT D&D MONSTER MANUAL PLATE.
  
  This illustration captures everything about the attic:
  
  1. THE STYLE — Authentic 1977-1983 Monster Manual art
  2. THE ITEMS — All magical items visible and recognizable
  3. THE ATMOSPHERE — Cramped, dusty, mysterious, dangerous
  4. THE THREAT — The HAND under the sheet is genuinely unnerving
  5. THE HUMOR — An imp casually reading the cursed book
  
  This would fit perfectly in:
  - 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide
  - Original Monster Manual
  - A Ravenloft supplement
  
  The crosshatching is period-perfect.
  The sepia aging is authentic.
  The composition is classic dungeon room.
  
  Gary Gygax would approve.
  
  "Every attic tells a story.
   This one tells several, all at once,
   and some of them contradict."

generation_success: "SOURCEBOOK QUALITY — frame this and hang it in the tavern"
dm_recommendation: "Use as handout when players enter the attic"
gygax_approval_rating: "HIGH"
