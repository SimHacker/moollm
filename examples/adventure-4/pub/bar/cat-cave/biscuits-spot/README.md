# 🐕 Biscuit's Spot

> *"A dog bed in a cat cave. This should be impossible. But love makes impossible things happen."*

**The corner where a dog became family.**

---

## 🌅 Overview

A large golden cushion tucked into a corner of the Cat Cave. Dog-sized. Suspiciously comfortable. Surprisingly clean. (Stroopwafel grooms here. Secretly.)

The cushion is positioned perfectly:
- Close enough to the kitten pile for snuggles
- Not so close as to crowd Terpie's warmest spot
- With a clear view of the entrance
- Near the heat that rises from below

There's usually at least one kitten sleeping on or near Biscuit. Sometimes all eight. He doesn't mind. He loves it.
