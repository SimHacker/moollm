  description: |
    A warm, dim space carved into the back of the pub.
    Cushions everywhere. Heat from the fireplace seeps through.
    The smell of catnip and contentment fills the air.
    
    This is CAT TERRITORY.
    
    Humans are tolerated only if they bring treats
    and know how to properly scritch.
    
  atmosphere:
    lighting: dim, warm, filtered through fabric
    sound: purring, soft breathing, occasional mrrp
    smell: catnip, warm fur, mysterious cat smells
    temperature: always perfect (cats arranged it)
    feeling: utterly content, safe, sleepy

    # THE EXCEPTION
    adopted_dog:
      name: "Biscuit"
      status: "FAMILY"
      note: |
        The cats held a council. The vote was unanimous.
        Biscuit is not "a dog who is allowed in."
        Biscuit is "our dog."
        The distinction matters.
      privileges:
        - "May enter at any time"
        - "Has their own cushion (next to the kitten pile)"
        - "Gets groomed by Stroopwafel (don't tell anyone)"
        - "Is defended by the whole family"
      location: "pub/bar/cat-cave/biscuits-spot"
        
    how_to_gain_access:
      - "Be a cat"
      - "Be adopted by a cat here"
      - "Bring the RIGHT treats (ask Terpie)"

# SOCIAL DYNAMICS
#
# The cat cave has its own hierarchy:
#   1. Terpie (matriarch, warmest spot)
#   2. Stroopwafel (elder, wisdom)
#   3. Kittens (chaos, learning)
#
# Humans must earn trust:
#   - Bring appropriate offerings
#   - Demonstrate proper respect
#   - Be patient (cats decide the timeline)
#   - Accept rejection gracefully
#
# Once accepted, a human becomes "cat-friend"
# and may enter — but never BELONG.

    All 10 cats + 1 honorary dog = 11 sleeping souls.
    
    A symphony of purrs fills the cave.
    One gentle snore from Stroopwafel.
    Occasional dream-twitches from Biscuit.
    
    The garden knows them all now.
    The maze is thoroughly documented.
    The family is home. Safe. Together.
