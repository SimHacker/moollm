# 🐱 The Cat Cave

> *"Soft fur, loud purrs, profound indifference to human concerns."*

**Where the cats of The Rusty Lantern hold court.**

---

## 🌅 Overview

A cozy alcove behind the bar, fitted with cushions, cat trees, and warming shelves. The air is thick with purring and the faint scent of catnip.

Soft lamplight filters through, catching dust motes and the occasional drifting whisker. The cats observe all who enter with that particular feline combination of curiosity and disdain.
