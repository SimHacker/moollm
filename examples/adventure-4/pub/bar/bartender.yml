      This file was once 350 lines of rich bartender soul.
      Grim, Z-4RT, Nyx, Reginald, Pegleg Pete, Miss Kitty.
      All the shapeshifting wisdom. All the Quark-DS9 angles.
      All the Bar Karma mysticism (Will Wright + Don Hopkins!).
      
      Now that soul lives in the proper place:
      characters/fictional/the-bartender/CHARACTER.yml
      
      This pointer remains. The bartender is still here.
      They always are.
