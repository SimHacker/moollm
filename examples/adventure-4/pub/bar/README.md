# 🍺 The Bar

> *"Where the drinks flow and the stories never end."*

**The heart of The Rusty Lantern.**

## 🌅 Overview

Dark wood bar, polished by a century of elbows. Brass rail at foot level, worn bright. Behind the bar: shelves of bottles catching lamplight — jenever, advocaat, bitters, and things without labels.

The bartender wipes glasses that are already clean, nodding at regulars, sizing up newcomers. Marieke the budtender works the corner, handling the *special* menu with discretion.

In the back, through a low archway, soft purring emanates from the **Cat Cave**.
