# 🕹️ The Arcade Corner

> *"Insert coin to continue."*

**Classic cabinets, eternal high scores.**

## 🌅 Overview

A corner of the pub where the glow of CRT screens competes with the oil lamps. Four cabinets stand in a row, each a time capsule from a different era of gaming.

The carpet is sticky with decades of spilled drinks. The sound of bleeps, bloops, and the occasional frustrated slap of a cabinet fills the air.

A chalkboard on the wall lists high scores. Some of those initials have been there since the 80s.
