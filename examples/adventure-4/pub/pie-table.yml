  description: |
    An octagonal table of polished walnut, its surface inlaid with
    a radial pattern of lighter wood forming eight equal wedges —
    like a pie menu made physical. At the center, a lazy susan holds
    a brass speaking bell. Around it, eight high-backed chairs wait
    in perfect symmetry.
    
    A small plaque reads: "All voices equal. All directions valid.
    Ring to speak. Pass to yield."

      The round table gleams softly in the pub's warm light. 
      Its pie-wedge pattern seems to pulse gently, as if awaiting

    The table spins... Eight figures materialize:
    - Optimist (NE): "Consciousness is computation!"
    - Skeptic (E): "Define consciousness first."
    - Ethicist (SE): "Can we consent on their behalf?"
    - Futurist (S): "It's inevitable, prepare now."
    - Historian (SW): "The Turing test is 75 years old..."
    - Pragmatist (W): "What policy follows from this?"
    - Mystic (NW): "Consciousness isn't what you think."

# YAML Jazz notes:
# - The pie menu metaphor: all choices equidistant from center
# - Don Hopkins' insight: radial selection reduces Fitts' Law overhead
# - Round tables: Arthurian equality, no head
# - The bell: physical interrupt protocol
# - Summoning: instant access to diverse perspectives
