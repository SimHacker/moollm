    An octagonal table of polished walnut, its surface inlaid with
    a radial pattern of lighter wood forming eight equal wedges —
    like a pie menu made physical. At the center, a lazy susan holds
    a brass speaking bell. Around it, eight high-backed chairs wait
    in perfect symmetry.
    
    A small plaque reads: "All voices equal. All directions valid.
    Ring to speak. Pass to yield."

        1. All seated players stand and circle the table
        2. Music plays (or someone hums)
        3. One chair is REMOVED (slice stays, compass stable!)
        4. Music stops — everyone scrambles for remaining chairs
        5. One player is left standing — eliminated (but kindly!)
        6. Repeat until one winner remains
        
        IMPORTANT: Compass directions stay STABLE.
        We don't re-layout — we just remove chairs from slices.

        Empty slices are still addressable (pub/pie-table.yml#NE)

        - *GONG* once for each eliminated player (mercy)
        - *GONG* *GONG* *GONG* for the winner! (celebration)
        
        The gong at pub/gong.yml is linked to the table.
        No need to manually ring — musical chairs triggers it.
        
        Eliminated players join the audience and heckle.
        Winner gets to pick next activity.
