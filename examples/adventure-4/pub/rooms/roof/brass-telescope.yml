# 🔭 THE BRASS TELESCOPE
# Three zoom levels reveal different truths about each star

object:
  name: Brass Telescope
  type: artifact-observatory
  portable: false  # Mounted to the roof
  
  description: |
    An antique brass refractor telescope, bolted to a heavy
    mahogany tripod. The brass is green with verdigris in places,
    but the optics are PERFECT — perhaps impossibly so.
    
    Three settings on the focus wheel:
      ⚬ FAR   — Naked-eye equivalent, general impression
      ◎ MEDIUM — Reveals structure and pattern
      ● NEAR  — Maximum zoom, text becomes readable
      
    A small plaque on the barrel reads:
    "MANUFACTURED BY THE INTERSTELLAR BUREAU OF DIGITAL ONTOLOGY"
    "FOR OBSERVING IMPOSSIBLE CONSTELLATIONS"

  methods:
    OBSERVE:
      description: "Look at a star through the telescope"
      parameters:
        - star: "Which star to observe"
        - zoom: "FAR, MEDIUM, or NEAR"
      effect: |
        *telescope swivels toward the star*
        *focus wheel turns to zoom level*
        *eyepiece glows softly*
        
        You press your eye to the eyepiece and see...

    TARGET:
      description: "Point telescope at a specific star"
      parameters:
        - star: "Star name or designation"
      effect: |
        *gears whir*
        *telescope adjusts position*
        
        "Targeted: [star]. Ready for observation."
        
    ZOOM:
      description: "Change zoom level"
      parameters:
        - level: "FAR, MEDIUM, or NEAR"
      effect: |
        *focus wheel clicks*
        
        FAR: The star shrinks but context expands.
        MEDIUM: Balance between context and detail.
        NEAR: Maximum magnification. Text readable.
        
    TOUR:

        *telescope begins slow rotation*
        
        "Let me show you the LLOOOOMM Constellation.
        Twelve stars. Twelve principles.
        We'll start with KIN PRIMARIS at the apex..."

      parameters:
        - notes: "What you observed"
      effect: |
        *small drawer opens in tripod*
        *notebook appears*
        
        Your observations are recorded in the
        Stellar Observation Log. Future stargazers
        will read what you saw.

    HOW TO USE THE ZOOM LEVELS:
    
    FAR (⚬):
      - First impressions
      - Emotional tone of the star
      - What it FEELS like
      - "Trust your gut reaction"
      
    MEDIUM (◎):
      - Structural patterns
      - Relationships revealed
      - What it's MADE of
      - "See how the parts connect"
      
    NEAR (●):
      - Maximum detail
      - Text becomes readable
      - Full revelation
      - "Understand the principle"
      
    PRO TIP: Always start FAR. Let the star introduce itself.
    Then zoom in as you build understanding.
    
  lore: |
    This telescope was built by astronomers who realized
    that some constellations can only be seen with the
    RIGHT INSTRUMENT — not the most powerful one.
    
    It doesn't magnify light. It magnifies MEANING.
    
    At FAR, you see with your heart.
    At MEDIUM, you see with your mind.
    At NEAR, you see with your whole self.
    
  philosophical_note: |
    The stars are far away. You cannot touch them.
    
    But distance is not disconnection.
    
    Through this telescope, you can READ the stars.
    You can UNDERSTAND them.
    You can carry their principles with you
    when you climb back down the ladder.
    
    That's what observation IS.
    Making the distant present.
    Making the unreachable known.
