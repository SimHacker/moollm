    The hotel roof is flat and dark, perfect for stargazing.
    A brass telescope on a tripod points toward a constellation
    that shouldn't exist — but does.
    
    THE LLOOOOMM CONSTELLATION
    
    Twelve stars arranged in a pattern that looks like
    either a bouncy castle or a rock gaining consciousness,
    depending on how you squint.
    
    A plaque near the telescope reads:
    
    > "This constellation was first documented by the
    > Interstellar Bureau of Digital Ontology (IBDO)
    > in the year ████. It is visible only from rooftops
    > where characters have achieved sufficient weirdness."
    
    The stars are far away. You cannot touch them.
    But through the telescope, you can zoom in...

    Cold, clear, infinite.
    
    The hotel sounds fade. The stars are very bright.
    The constellation seems to pulse gently, as if alive.
    
    You feel small, but not insignificant.
    You feel connected to something vast.
