# 📓 DEBUGGING JOURNAL
# A record of bugs found and fixed — learning from failure

  description: |
    A leather-bound journal sits on the nightstand, filled with
    handwritten entries. Each page documents a bug: what went wrong,
    what was expected, what was actually happening, and — most
    importantly — *why*.
    
    The last entry is blank, waiting for your contribution.

    Flipping through the pages reveals a taxonomy of failures:
    
    Page 17: "OFF BY ONE"
      Expected: 10 iterations
      Actual: 9 iterations  
      Why: i < 10, not i <= 10
      Lesson: Boundaries are where bugs live
      
    Page 42: "STATE MUTATION"
      Expected: Fresh list each time
      Actual: Same list, growing forever
      Why: Forgot to copy before modifying
      Lesson: Shared state is shared pain
      
    Page 89: "SEMANTIC DRIFT"
      Expected: LLM follows procedure
      Actual: LLM invents new rules mid-execution
      Why: Natural language is fuzzy; code is crisp
      Lesson: If it matters, write a sister script
      
    Page 137: "CONTEXT OVERFLOW"
      Expected: LLM remembers early instructions
      Actual: Instructions "forgotten" after summarization
      Why: Token pressure causes selective amnesia
      Lesson: Put critical info at the end, not the start
      
    Page 156: "THE KNIGHT KOAN"
      From: MIT AI Lab, Tom Knight
      
      > A novice was trying to fix a broken Lisp machine by
      > turning the power off and on.
      >
      > Knight, seeing what the student was doing, spoke sternly:
      > "You cannot fix a machine by just power-cycling it with
      > no understanding of what is going wrong."
      >
      > Knight turned the machine off and on.
      >
      > The machine worked.
      
      Lesson: The same action can be superstition or mastery,
              depending on understanding. The fix isn't the fix.
              The understanding is the fix.
              
    Page 157: "THE FONZIE COROLLARY"
      Principle: UNDERSTAND → BOINK!
      
      In MOOLLM, the sequence matters:
      
      1. FIRST you totally understand what's wrong
      2. THEN you can fix it with percussive maintenance
      
      The Fonzie punch only works on a jukebox you understand.
      The Knight power-cycle only works on a Lisp machine you grok.
      
      Without understanding: superstition, cargo cult, luck
      With understanding: engineering, mastery, BOINK! 👊

      The ritual looks the same. The results differ.
      Understanding is the invisible prerequisite.

      template: |
        ## [DATE] — [BUG NAME]
        
        **Expected**: What should have happened
        **Actual**: What actually happened
        **Why**: Root cause analysis
        **Lesson**: What to remember next time
        
    SEARCH:

      parameters:
        - pattern: "keyword or symptom"
      returns: "Matching entries from the journal"
      
    RANDOM:
      description: "Open to a random page for inspiration"
      effect: "Sometimes the bug you need to understand isn't the one you're debugging."
      
  lore: |
    This journal was started by the first guest of Room 1.
    Every guest since has added at least one entry.
    
    The oldest entry reads:
    
    > "My first bug was thinking I was above bugs."
    
  philosophy: |
    Debugging is not failure. Debugging is the *opposite* of failure.
    
    A bug is a discrepancy between model and reality.
    Finding a bug means your model is improving.
    Fixing a bug means you understand something you didn't before.
    
    The journal doesn't record mistakes. It records learning.
