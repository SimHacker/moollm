# ⚙️ CLOCK MECHANISM
# A clock you can take apart — understanding through disassembly

  name: Clock Mechanism
  type: artifact
  portable: true
  
  description: |
    A brass clock mechanism sits on the workbench, case open, gears
    visible and slowly turning. Someone has labeled each part with
    tiny handwritten tags: "escapement", "mainspring", "gear train".
    
    It still keeps time. You can watch the second hand tick while
    examining exactly *how* it ticks.
    
  examine: |
    The mechanism reveals itself layer by layer:
    
    POWER SOURCE:
      mainspring: "Stores energy when wound"
      tension: "Currently at 60% — good for 18 hours"
      
    GEAR TRAIN:
      - center_wheel: "1 rotation per hour"
      - third_wheel: "1 rotation per minute" 
      - escape_wheel: "30 teeth, controls tick rate"
      
    ESCAPEMENT:
      anchor: "The tick-tock mechanism"
      purpose: "Releases exactly one tooth per oscillation"
      
    REGULATOR:
      balance_wheel: "Oscillates at 18,000 beats/hour"
      hairspring: "Provides restoring force"
      
    This is how all complex systems work: simple parts, precise
    interactions, emergent behavior.
    
  state:
    wound: 60%
    running: true
    accuracy: "+2 seconds/day"
    last_serviced: "1847"

      response: "Take it apart. Label the pieces. Reassemble. Now you know."

      score: 0.8
      response: "Every complex system is simple parts in conversation."

      score: 0.5
      response: "Time is just counting. The clock counts oscillations."
      
  methods:
    DISASSEMBLE:
      description: "Take the clock apart, piece by piece"
      effect: |
        The mechanism separates into labeled components.
        Each part can be examined individually.
        Reassembly requires understanding the relationships.
        
    TRACE-TICK:
      description: "Follow the energy through one tick"
      returns: |
        1. Mainspring releases tension
        2. Gear train transfers torque
        3. Escape wheel advances one tooth
        4. Anchor oscillates
        5. Second hand moves 1/60th of a minute
        
    ADJUST:
      description: "Modify the regulator to change accuracy"
      parameters:
        - hairspring_tension: "faster or slower"
      effect: "The clock's rate changes. Test against a reference."
      
    WIND:
      description: "Wind the mainspring"
      effect: "Stores 24 hours of operation"
      
  lore: |
    This clock was made by a Dutch craftsman in 1847. It has been
    taken apart and reassembled 347 times by curious guests.
    
    Every guest who understands it leaves a small annotation on
    the tags. The tags now contain centuries of accumulated insight.
    
  insight: |
    MOOLLM skills are like clock mechanisms:
    - CARD.yml is the interface (the face)
    - SKILL.md is the mechanism (the gears)
    - README.md is the annotation (the tags)
    
    You understand a skill by taking it apart.
