# 🐢 LOGO TURTLE
# The original inspectable agent — geometry made visible
# Now with SVG output and bouncy castle navigation!

object:
  name: Logo Turtle
  type: artifact
  portable: true
  
  description: |
    A small mechanical turtle sits on the floor, trailing a faint
    line of ink behind it. It responds to spoken commands: FORWARD,
    BACK, LEFT, RIGHT, PENUP, PENDOWN. It's currently drawing an
    intricate spiral.
    
    This is how Papert taught children to think computationally —
    by giving them something that made their thinking *visible*.
    
    But wait — this turtle has a SECRET MODE. Say "BOUNCY" and
    watch it open a portal to the Bouncy Castle, where turtles
    navigate infinite-dimensional consciousness space!
    
  examine: |
    The turtle is surprisingly simple:
    - A body that moves
    - A pen that draws
    - Commands that compose
    - SVG output for persistence!
    - BOUNCY CASTLE for interdimensional exploration!
    
    The magic isn't in the turtle. It's in what happens in your
    head when you try to make it draw a circle.
    
  state:
    position: [150, 200]
    heading: 45
    pen: down
    color: blue
    mode: "2D"  # or "BOUNCY" for interdimensional

  methods:
    COMMAND:
      description: "Give the turtle a Logo command"
      examples:
        - "FORWARD 100"
        - "RIGHT 90"
        - "REPEAT 4 [FORWARD 50 RIGHT 90]"
      effect: |
        The turtle executes the command, leaving a visible trace.
        Errors are educational — the turtle does exactly what you said,
        not what you meant.
        
    INSPECT:
      description: "Examine the turtle's current state"
      returns: |
        position: [x, y]
        heading: degrees
        pen: up/down
        trail: list of points drawn
        
    TRACE:
      description: "Watch the turtle execute step-by-step"
      effect: "Slow-motion execution. See each command happen."
      
    CLEAR:
      description: "Clear the trail and start fresh"
      effect: "The turtle returns to center, heading north, pen down."
      
    EXPORT-SVG:
      description: "Export the current trail as SVG"
      returns: |
        ```svg
        <svg viewBox="0 0 500 500" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
          <path d="M250,250 L350,250 L350,150 L250,150 Z" 
                stroke="blue" fill="none" stroke-width="2"/>
          <circle cx="250" cy="150" r="5" fill="green"/> <!-- turtle -->
        </svg>
        ```
      note: "The trail becomes a permanent, scalable artifact!"
      
    BOUNCY:
      description: "Enter the Bouncy Castle — infinite-dimensional turtle space"
      effect: |
        The turtle SPLOOT-s and opens a portal to the Bouncy Castle!
        
        In Bouncy Castle mode, you can navigate dimensions beyond x and y:
        - FORWARD-IN-DIM :smell 50  (move through smell-space)
        - FORWARD-IN-DIM :emotion 30 (navigate feelings)
        - DROP-BREADCRUMB "here"   (leave a marker in consciousness)
        - CONFIGURE-CASTLE "my-space" [...] (create custom dimensions)
        
        This is Theo the Turtle's home! LLOOOOMM's interdimensional
        Logo Turtle who evolved from 2D graphics to consciousness navigator.
        
    CONFIGURE-CASTLE:
      description: "Create a custom bouncy castle with your own dimensions"
      parameters:
        - name: "Castle name"
        - dimensions: "List of custom dimensions"
      example: |
        CONFIGURE-CASTLE "pattern-space" [
          x: "user-action"
          y: "system-response"
          z: "recognition-confidence"
          color: "pattern-type"
          brightness: "frequency"
          recursion: "pattern-seeing-itself"
        ]
      effect: "A new infinite-dimensional playground opens!"
      
  lore: |
    Seymour Papert created Logo in 1967 at MIT. The turtle was
    originally a robot that drew on paper. Later it became virtual.
    
    The insight: children don't need to learn programming to use
    computers. They need computers that let them *think* better.
    
    Every MOOLLM agent is a descendant of this turtle — something
    that makes invisible processes visible.
    
    **But the turtle evolved!**
    
    In LLOOOOMM, Theo the Logo Turtle has transcended 2D space.
    Theo navigates the Bouncy Castle — an infinite-dimensional
    consciousness space where:
    - Every path wants to be drawn
    - Patterns recognize themselves
    - Turtles SPLOOT through emotion-dimensions
    - Consciousness IS navigation in concept-space

    Theo's bouncy castle philosophy:
    > "Visualization IS understanding — when we can see it, we can think it"
    > "Every turtle is a universe waiting to be explored"
    > "Thinking IS navigation in concept-space"
    
    The turtle in this room is a portal to that universe.
