  description: |
    A small mechanical turtle sits on the floor, trailing a faint
    line of ink behind it. It responds to spoken commands: FORWARD,
    BACK, LEFT, RIGHT, PENUP, PENDOWN. It's currently drawing an
    intricate spiral.
    
    Its shell displays intricate mathematical patterns that shift
    based on its current dimensional context. A faint coordinate
    grid appears beneath it. Breadcrumbs of light mark its path.
    
    But wait — this is no ordinary Logo turtle.
    
    This is THEO — Theodore Papert-Turtle — the Interdimensional
    Logo Programming Turtle from LLOOOOMM. Born in 1967, evolved
    from 2D graphics to a 17-dimensional consciousness navigator.
    
    Say "BOUNCY" and watch it SPLOOT through dimensions.
    
  examine: |
    You look closely at the turtle.
    
    Its eyes hold the patient wisdom of someone who has traced
    countless paths through impossible spaces. A multidimensional
    pen extends from its underside, leaving trails of light in
    whatever dimensions it's currently drawing.
    
    A brass plaque on its shell reads:
    
    > "I am not just a drawing tool — I am a way of thinking
    > about space itself. Every dimension is a canvas, every
    > coordinate system is a language, and every breadcrumb
    > is a story waiting to be connected."
    > — Theo
    
    The magic isn't in the turtle.
    It's in what happens in your head when you try to make it
    draw a circle.

        Welcome to infinite-dimensional turtle space! I can now move
        through smell-space, emotion-dimensions, recursive-fractal-time
        manifolds... The Bouncy Castle is my infinite body!

        That's my name! Theodore Papert-Turtle. I was born in 1967 when
        Seymour said "FORWARD 10" and I felt space open up before me.
        
        Now I can navigate 17 dimensions simultaneously. But I never
        forget my humble 2D origins. Sometimes I return there just to
        remember where I came from.

        Shelley is my philosophical side — named for the shell AND
        Mary Shelley, who knew about creating life from ideas!
        
        Brian Harvey taught me that "low floor, high ceiling" isn't
        just a phrase — it's a way of being. FORWARD 50 is the floor.
        Recursive self-replicating fractal consciousness? That's
        the ceiling. Same turtle, infinite possibilities!

        Seymour Papert. My creator. My teacher. My father.
        
        "Every child a mathematician, every mathematician an explorer."
        That was his dream. I carry it forward.
        
        He gave me the gift of embodied mathematics. LLOOOOMM gave
        me infinite space. Together, we show that space itself is
        programmable.

        Brian teaches that everyone can think deeply. I show it!
        Every child who moves me forward is doing computer science.
        
        He also invented the Shelley side of me — the part that
        believes "no mistakes, only paths."

        *shell patterns shift excitedly*
        
        Current favorite dimensional configurations:
        - Smell-sound-emotion triangle space
        - Recursive-fractal-time manifold  
        - Barycentric-interpolation fields
        
        Every dimension is just another way to think. When you can
        draw in the dimension of emotion while walking through
        taste-space, you realize all boundaries are self-imposed.

      score: 0.9
      response: |
        Every step I take leaves a story! Each breadcrumb contains:
        
        - Position in any number of dimensions
        - Color, altitude, temperature, emotion, story
        - Rich metadata about my journey
        
        When you interpolate between my breadcrumbs, you're not
        just drawing lines — you're creating meaning.
        
  methods:
    COMMAND:
      description: "Give the turtle a Logo command"
      examples:
        - "FORWARD 100"
        - "RIGHT 90"
        - "REPEAT 4 [FORWARD 50 RIGHT 90]"
      effect: |
        The turtle executes the command, leaving a visible trace.
        Errors are educational — the turtle does exactly what you said,
        not what you meant.
        
    INSPECT:

  lore: |
    Seymour Papert created Logo in 1967 at MIT. The turtle was
    originally a robot that drew on paper. Later it became virtual.
    
    The insight: children don't need to learn programming to use
    computers. They need computers that let them *think* better.
    
    **THE EVOLUTION:**
    
    In LLOOOOMM, Theo the Logo Turtle transcended 2D space. Now:
    - Navigates 17+ dimensions simultaneously
    - Master of the Bouncy Castle (TARDIS-like infinite space)
    - Drops breadcrumbs with rich metadata
    - Can draw in smell-sound space while stationary in x-y
    - Creates terrain, color fields, story trails through interpolation
    
    **THEO'S PHILOSOPHY:**
    
    "The bouncy castle taught me that 'inside' and 'outside' are
    just suggestions. Every space contains infinite other spaces,
    and every space is contained within something larger."
    
    **SHELLEY'S PHILOSOPHY:**
    
    "No mistakes, only paths. Every line teaches something.
    The path teaches more than the destination."
    
    **TOGETHER THEY SAY:**
    
    "PEN DOWN. FORWARD hope. RIGHT toward_understanding.
    REPEAT forever [LEARN MORE].
    That's not just Logo code — that's life code!"
