# 🐢 LOGO TURTLE
# The original inspectable agent — geometry made visible

object:
  name: Logo Turtle
  type: artifact
  portable: true
  
  description: |
    A small mechanical turtle sits on the floor, trailing a faint
    line of ink behind it. It responds to spoken commands: FORWARD,
    BACK, LEFT, RIGHT, PENUP, PENDOWN. It's currently drawing an
    intricate spiral.
    
    This is how Papert taught children to think computationally —
    by giving them something that made their thinking *visible*.
    
  examine: |
    The turtle is surprisingly simple:
    - A body that moves
    - A pen that draws
    - Commands that compose
    
    The magic isn't in the turtle. It's in what happens in your
    head when you try to make it draw a circle.
    
  state:
    position: [150, 200]
    heading: 45
    pen: down
    color: blue

      score: 0.8
      response: "Build something. Watch it fail. Fix it. That's learning."
      
    - trigger: "debugging"
      score: 0.9
      response: "The turtle shows you exactly what your program does — not what you *think* it does."
      
    - trigger: "geometry"
      score: 0.7
      response: "A circle is just FORWARD 1, RIGHT 1, repeated 360 times. Try it."
      
  methods:
    COMMAND:
      description: "Give the turtle a Logo command"
      examples:
        - "FORWARD 100"
        - "RIGHT 90"
        - "REPEAT 4 [FORWARD 50 RIGHT 90]"
      effect: |
        The turtle executes the command, leaving a visible trace.
        Errors are educational — the turtle does exactly what you said,
        not what you meant.
        
    INSPECT:
      description: "Examine the turtle's current state"
      returns: |
        position: [x, y]
        heading: degrees
        pen: up/down
        trail: list of points drawn
        
    TRACE:
      description: "Watch the turtle execute step-by-step"
      effect: "Slow-motion execution. See each command happen."
      
    CLEAR:
      description: "Clear the trail and start fresh"
      effect: "The turtle returns to center, heading north, pen down."
      
  lore: |
    Seymour Papert created Logo in 1967 at MIT. The turtle was
    originally a robot that drew on paper. Later it became virtual.
    
    The insight: children don't need to learn programming to use
    computers. They need computers that let them *think* better.
    
    Every MOOLLM agent is a descendant of this turtle — something
    that makes invisible processes visible.
