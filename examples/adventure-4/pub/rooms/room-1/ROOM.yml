    Morning light streams through an east-facing window onto a room
    filled with *inspectable artifacts*. Every object here can be
    taken apart, examined, and reassembled. A Logo turtle traces
    spirals on the floor. A half-built clock sits on the workbench,
    gears visible and turning.
    
    Above the bed hangs a quote in gold letters:
    
    > "You can't think about thinking without thinking about
    > thinking about something." — Seymour Papert
