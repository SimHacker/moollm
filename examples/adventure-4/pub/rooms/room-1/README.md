# 🐢 Room 1 — The Constructionist Suite

> *"You can't think about thinking without thinking about thinking about something."*
> — Seymour Papert

**Build to learn. Inspect to understand.**

---

## 🌅 Overview

Morning light streams through an east-facing window onto a room filled with *inspectable artifacts*. Every object here can be taken apart, examined, and reassembled.

A Logo turtle traces spirals on the floor. A half-built clock sits on the workbench, gears visible and turning.

This is a room for **tinkers, makers, reverse-engineers** — those who understand that "debugging" is a life philosophy.

## 🎭 Permanent Resident

**Logo Turtle** — Still drawing. Still teaching. The floor is covered in spirographs.

## 💡 Philosophy

Papert's **constructionism** teaches that the best way to learn is to BUILD something. Not to be told, not to memorize — but to create, inspect, debug, and understand.

Every object in this room can be taken apart. Every mechanism can be traced. Every failure is a lesson.

*"The role of the teacher is to create the conditions for invention rather than provide ready-made knowledge."*
