# 🐢 Room 1 — The Constructionist Suite

> *"You can't think about thinking without thinking about thinking about something."*
> — Seymour Papert

**Build to learn. Inspect to understand.**

---

## 🌅 Overview

Morning light streams through an east-facing window onto a room filled with *inspectable artifacts*. Every object here can be taken apart, examined, and reassembled.

A Logo turtle traces spirals on the floor. A half-built clock sits on the workbench, gears visible and turning.

This is a room for **tinkers, makers, reverse-engineers** — those who understand that "debugging" is a life philosophy.

## 🎭 Permanent Resident

**Logo Turtle (Theo)** 🐢📐🎨🏰✨

Still drawing. Still teaching. The floor is covered in spirographs.

This turtle is an **instance** deployed in this room — it can summon Seymour Papert, teach LOGO, and remember everything that happens here.

### 🚗 Vehicle Mode

The turtle can be **embarked as a vehicle** for adventure travel:

| Command | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| `EMBARK` | Step into the turtle, become its pilot |
| `FORWARD [exit]` | Travel through an exit |
| `RIGHT/LEFT` | Turn to face different exits |
| `PENDOWN/PENUP` | Leave trail or travel unseen |
| `DISEMBARK` | Step out at current location |
| `GO HOME` | Return to Room 1 from anywhere |

The turtle's **home is Room 1**, but it can carry you anywhere in the adventure. When you disembark, you're at the new location. The turtle stays with you, ready for another journey.

## 💡 Philosophy

Papert's **constructionism** teaches that the best way to learn is to BUILD something. Not to be told, not to memorize — but to create, inspect, debug, and understand.

Every object in this room can be taken apart. Every mechanism can be traced. Every failure is a lesson.

*"The role of the teacher is to create the conditions for invention rather than provide ready-made knowledge."*
