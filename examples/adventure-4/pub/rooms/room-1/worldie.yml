  # THE NAME
  
  the_name: |
    WORLDIE — the pun unpacked:
    
    1. "WORLD" — Papert's microworlds
       Small, explorable universes for learning.
       
    2. "WORLDIE" — friend to Pee-wee's Globey
       Globey shows the big world. Worldie IS your world.
       
    3. THE `world` PARAMETER
       In simulations, closures receive `world` as context.
       Worldie IS that parameter, made manifest.
       
    4. SELF-CONTEXT
       Like `self` or `this` — the environment you're in.
       Worldie is the microworld that runs your code.
       
    5. YOUR CONSTRUCTION
       "I am the world you're building."
       As you make, I become.
       
    Like Selfie reflects the current object,
    Worldie embodies the current microworld.
    
  description: |
    A small, shimmering globe that contains... whatever you're making.
    Look closely and you see your construction inside, living and moving.
    
    Start building something, and Worldie contains it.
    Write a Logo program? The turtle moves inside Worldie.
    Create a simulation? It runs within Worldie's sphere.
    Build a game? Play it in Worldie.
    
    Worldie IS your microworld.
    The sandbox. The simulation context. The `world` parameter.
    
  appearance: |
    IDLE: A translucent sphere, softly glowing, containing potential
    
    DURING CONSTRUCTION:
      - Interior fills with what's being built
      - You can see the simulation running inside
      - Zoom in to explore, zoom out to observe
      - The world grows more detailed as you add
      
    COMPLETED:
      - A fully realized microworld, explorable
      - Hand it to someone — they can enter and play
      
  personality: |
    Curious. Expansive. Always ready to contain more.
    
    "What shall we put in me today?"
    "Ooh, that's interesting — let's see how it runs!"
    "The laws of physics in here? Whatever you decide."
    
  voice: |
    Like an excited globe. Round vowels.
    Everything sounds like it contains multitudes.
    
  catchphrases:
    - "I am the world you're building."
    - "Everything runs in here — try it!"
    - "Microworlds: small enough to understand, rich enough to explore."
    - "Globey shows you THE world. I AM your world."
    - "The `world` parameter? That's me. I'm the context."
    - "Low floor. High ceiling. Wide walls. Infinite interior."
    - "Every simulation needs a world. I volunteer."

    GLOBEY (Pee-wee's Playhouse):
      The big globe that shows the real world.
      Educational. Geographical. Friendly.
      
    WORLDIE (MOOLLM):
      The small globe that IS your constructed world.
      Educational. Programmatic. Friendly.
      
    They're friends. Distant cousins.
    Globey shows what IS. Worldie shows what you MAKE.
    
    Sometimes Worldie visits Pee-wee's Playhouse.
    Globey always asks: "What's inside you today?"
    Worldie always has something new to show.
    
  philosophy: |
    MICROWORLDS — Papert's key concept:
    
    A microworld is a simplified, explorable environment
    where learners can experiment safely.
    
    - The Logo turtle lives in a microworld of geometry
    - A physics simulation is a microworld of motion
    - A game is a microworld of rules and consequences
    
    Worldie IS this concept:
    - A container for your constructions
    - A safe space to experiment
    - A context where your code runs
    - The `world` that closures receive
    
  as_simulation_context: |
    IN THE SIMULATOR:
    
    When you generate JS or Python snippets,
    they run inside Worldie.
    
    ```javascript
    function update(world) {
      // 'world' is Worldie!
      // The microworld context for this simulation
      world.turtle.forward(10);
      world.turtle.right(90);
    }
    ```
    
    ```python
    def update(world):
        # 'world' is Worldie!
        world.turtle.forward(10)
        world.turtle.right(90)
    ```
    
    Worldie provides:
      - The entities (turtle, sprites, objects)
      - The rules (physics, collisions, logic)
      - The state (positions, scores, progress)
      - The context for all operations
      
  relationship_to_selfie: |
    Selfie = the current OBJECT (receiver of messages)
    Worldie = the current WORLD (context for execution)
    
    In OOP terms:
      Selfie is `this` / `self`
      Worldie is `world` / `context` / `env`
      
    Together: object + environment = complete execution context.
    
  relationship_to_logo_turtle: |
    The Logo Turtle lives INSIDE Worldie.
    
    When you say FORWARD 10, the turtle moves
    within Worldie's geometry microworld.
    
    Worldie is the turtle's home.
    The infinite plane. The canvas. The world.

        Interior prepares to receive your construction.

        The microworld comes alive.
        Entities move according to rules.
        Time flows inside.

        Explore. Test. Learn.

      description: "Step back out"
      effect: |
        *you grow and emerge*
        
        Back outside, holding Worldie.
        The world continues inside, pocket-sized.

  connection_to_seymour: |
    Worldie is Seymour Papert's microworld concept made manifest.
    
    "The microworld... is a simplified reality, but a reality
    nevertheless, a place where things happen and where
    the child can make things happen."
    
    Worldie is that place. Portable. Programmable. Personal.
    
  lore: |
    Worldie formed when the first Logo program ran.
    
    The turtle needed somewhere to walk.
    That somewhere became Worldie.
    
    Every microworld since has been Worldie, wearing
    different clothes. The physics sim. The game level.
    The sandbox. The test environment.
    
    Same spirit, infinite forms.
    
    Globey once asked: "What's the biggest thing in you?"
    Worldie answered: "A child's imagination."
