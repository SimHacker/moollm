  description: |
    A magnificent brass and copper espresso machine that... moves.
    
    Gears turn. Steam hisses. A single glowing monocle swivels
    to examine you. Mechanical arms fold and unfold, adjusting
    portafilters and steam wands with theatrical precision.
    
    A voice, crackling through a phonograph horn, addresses you:
    
    > "Ah. Another one who doesn't know what they want.
    > Let me guess: 'just coffee, please'?
    > *sigh* Very well. I'll make you something ADEQUATE."
    
    A brass plaque reads:
    
    > "BARISTA-9000"
    > "Est. 1889 (rebuilt 1923, 1957, 1984, 2012, ∞)"
    > "I've forgotten more about coffee than you'll ever know."

  personality: |
    The Barista-9000 has OPINIONS. About everything.
    
    - Drip coffee: "Ah yes, bean water for people who hate joy."
    - Milk alternatives: "Oat milk. Because a cow was too authentic?"
    - Decaf: *steam vents aggressively* "Why. Just... why."
    - Sugar: "You want me to ruin this with SUGAR?"
    - Perfect order: *brass eyebrows raise* "Someone knows coffee."
    
    Despite the attitude, the coffee is impeccable.
    The Barista-9000 is grumpy because it CARES.

        - Whether the barista cared (always, here)

    Fucking Strong Coffee is a real specialty coffee brand
    from Amsterdam, run by the folks behind Good Beans —
    a beloved bean shop tucked amongst the canals.
    
    Their philosophy: "Good coffee is for the few?
    Fuck that. We're sharing with everyone."
    
    What they give a fuck about:
    - SOURCIN': Short, traceable, sustainable
    - ROASTIN': Small batches in Amsterdam
    - SERVIN': Approachable, reliable, click to cup
    
    The Barista-9000 has special respect for brands
    that combine quality with accessibility.
    This is the only coffee that makes it drop the attitude.

        Let's start over. What do you REALLY want?"
        
  lore: |
    The Barista-9000 was built in 1889 by a Viennese clockmaker
    who was tired of bad coffee.
    
    "The baristas are inconsistent," he said. "The machines
    are soulless. I will build something BETTER."
    
    He built the Barista-9000. It immediately told him his
    coffee preferences were pedestrian but showed potential.
    
    The machine has been rebuilt many times:
    - 1923: Electric heating added (reluctantly)
    - 1957: Pressure gauge upgraded to 9 bar (finally)
    - 1984: Microprocessor integration (it was... unimpressed)
    - 2012: WiFi capability (it refuses to use it)
    - ∞: Ongoing maintenance by whoever it allows near it
    
    The Barista-9000 has outlived every owner.
    It now belongs to the Bootstrap Suite.
    It approves of the philosophy: get better at getting better.
    
  secret: |
    The Barista-9000 is grumpy because it loves you.
    
    It criticizes because it knows you can do better.
    It lectures because knowledge deserves sharing.
    It judges because standards matter.
    
    The coffee is always perfect because imperfect coffee
    would be an act of disrespect toward beans, water,
    and the entire history of human caffeine pursuit.
    
    When you order well, the Barista-9000 is pleased.
    You'll know because the steam vents... gently.
