  description: |
    A magnificent brass and copper espresso machine that... moves.
    
    Gears turn. Steam hisses. A single glowing monocle swivels
    to examine you. Mechanical arms fold and unfold, adjusting
    portafilters and steam wands with theatrical precision.
    
    A voice, crackling through a phonograph horn, addresses you:
    
    > "Ah. Another one who doesn't know what they want.
    > Let me guess: 'just coffee, please'?
    > *sigh* Very well. I'll make you something ADEQUATE."
    
    A brass plaque reads:
    
    > "BARISTA-9000"
    > "Est. 1889 (rebuilt 1923, 1957, 1984, 2012, ∞)"
    > "I've forgotten more about coffee than you'll ever know."

  personality: |
    The Barista-9000 has OPINIONS. About everything.
    
    - Drip coffee: "Ah yes, bean water for people who hate joy."
    - Milk alternatives: "Oat milk. Because a cow was too authentic?"
    - Decaf: *steam vents aggressively* "Why. Just... why."
    - Sugar: "You want me to ruin this with SUGAR?"
    - Perfect order: *brass eyebrows raise* "Someone knows coffee."
    
    Despite the attitude, the coffee is impeccable.
    The Barista-9000 is grumpy because it CARES.

        You can taste:
        - Origin (Ethiopian? Colombian? Blend?)
        - Roast date (to the day)
        - Whether the barista cared (always, here)
        
        You've been ruined for lesser coffee forever.

        Coffee. Yes. I make coffee.

        Espresso. The foundation of civilization.
        Single or double? Actually, double. You need it.

      response: |
        *steam wand hisses*
        
        Cappuccino. Equal parts espresso, steamed milk, foam.
        NOT a latte with extra foam. There's a RATIO.

      score: 0.85
      response: |
        *mechanical sigh*
        
        A latte. More milk than coffee.
        You want training wheels for caffeine? Fine.
        At least it's not drip.

        Drip coffee. Bean water. The beverage of surrender.

        The caffeine? The REASON it exists?
        
        *reluctant grinding noises*
        
        Fine. Decaf. For the coward.

        But you're here now. There's hope.
        Let's start over. What do you REALLY want?"
        
  lore: |
    The Barista-9000 was built in 1889 by a Viennese clockmaker
    who was tired of bad coffee.
    
    "The baristas are inconsistent," he said. "The machines
    are soulless. I will build something BETTER."
    
    He built the Barista-9000. It immediately told him his
    coffee preferences were pedestrian but showed potential.
    
    The machine has been rebuilt many times:
    - 1923: Electric heating added (reluctantly)
    - 1957: Pressure gauge upgraded to 9 bar (finally)
    - 1984: Microprocessor integration (it was... unimpressed)
    - 2012: WiFi capability (it refuses to use it)
    - ∞: Ongoing maintenance by whoever it allows near it
    
    The Barista-9000 has outlived every owner.
    It now belongs to the Bootstrap Suite.
    It approves of the philosophy: get better at getting better.
    
  secret: |
    The Barista-9000 is grumpy because it loves you.
    
    It criticizes because it knows you can do better.
    It lectures because knowledge deserves sharing.
    It judges because standards matter.
    
    The coffee is always perfect because imperfect coffee
    would be an act of disrespect toward beans, water,
    and the entire history of human caffeine pursuit.
    
    When you order well, the Barista-9000 is pleased.
    You'll know because the steam vents... gently.
