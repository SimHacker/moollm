# 🧭 EXPLORER'S FIELD KIT
# Tools for orientation — the bootstrap toolkit for curious minds

object:
  name: Explorer's Field Kit
  type: artifact
  portable: true
  
  description: |
    A well-worn leather satchel containing instruments for
    figuring out where you are and what's possible.
    Compass, notebook, magnifying glass — but also
    curious tools: a "goal dowsing rod", an "opportunity spyglass",
    a "boundary feeler".
    
    The brass clasp is engraved: "FOR NEW BEGINNINGS"
    Inside the lid: "Orientation precedes action."

    You open the satchel and find:
    
    NAVIGATION TOOLS:
      🧭 Compass — "Which way am I facing?"
      📓 Field Notebook — "What have I noticed?"
      🔍 Magnifying Glass — "What details matter?"
      
    CURIOSITY INSTRUMENTS:
      🎯 Goal Dowsing Rod — "What am I here to do?"
           (wiggles toward purpose, stronger near clarity)
      🔭 Opportunity Spyglass — "What can I interact with?"
           (highlights affordances, reveals hidden options)
      🪶 Boundary Feather — "What are the rules here?"
           (floats until it hits a constraint, then stops)
      📋 Capability Clipboard — "What tools do I have?"
           (auto-fills with available actions)
      
    META INSTRUMENTS:
      🎭 Driver Mirror — "Who's orchestrating this session?"
      📜 Context Scroll — "What's in my working memory?"
      ⏳ Token Hourglass — "How much space do I have left?"
      
  state:
    last_exploration: "this room"
    curiosity_level: "high"
    battery: "runs on wonder (infinite)"

        *hands you the field notebook*
        
        "First we figure out where we are.
        Then we figure out what's possible.
        Then we decide what matters."

        *unfolds the kit on a flat surface*
        *each instrument activates*
        
        The compass settles. The spyglass focuses.
        The dowsing rod twitches toward something.

  lore: |
    This kit was assembled by an explorer who specialized
    in "first mornings" — those moments when you wake up
    somewhere unfamiliar and have to figure out everything.
    
    "You can't move until you know where you are," she said.
    "And you can't know where you are without looking."
    
    She was kind. She knew that disorientation is scary.
    These tools make it a little less so.
    
  connection_to_bootstrap: |
    The bootstrap skill uses this kit:
    - CURSOR driver detection is the Driver Mirror
    - hot.yml and cold.yml are Field Notes
    - working-set.yml is the current orientation
    
    Every MOOLLM session starts with orientation.
    Curiosity, not interrogation.
    
  philosophical_note: |
    Probes can feel invasive.
    Exploration feels like play.
    
    Both gather information.
    One treats the world as subject.
    One treats the world as friend.
