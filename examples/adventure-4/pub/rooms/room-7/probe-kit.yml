# 🔬 PROBE KIT
# Tools for figuring out where you are — the bootstrap toolkit

object:
  name: Probe Kit
  type: artifact
  portable: true
  
  description: |
    A leather case containing instruments for environmental
    assessment. Compass, thermometer, barometer — but also
    stranger tools: a "goal detector", an "affordance scanner",
    a "constraint mapper".
    
    The case is labeled: "FOR COLD STARTS"
    
  examine: |
    The kit contains:
    
    STANDARD PROBES:
      - Compass: "Where is north?" (basic orientation)
      - Thermometer: "What's the temperature?" (environment state)
      - Barometer: "What's the pressure?" (hidden constraints)
      
    AGENT PROBES:
      - Goal Detector: "What am I supposed to do?"
      - Affordance Scanner: "What can I interact with?"
      - Constraint Mapper: "What are the rules here?"
      - Tool Inventory: "What capabilities do I have?"
      
    META PROBES:
      - Driver Detector: "What orchestrator is running me?"
      - Context Sampler: "What's in my context window?"
      - Token Gauge: "How much space do I have?"
      
  state:
    last_probe: "this room"
    probes_available: 9
    battery: "full"

      response: "Run the probes. Let's find out together."
      
    - trigger: "what can I do"
      score: 0.9
      response: "Affordance scanner. Point it at anything."

      response: "The kit contains the complete boot protocol."

  lore: |
    The probe kit was assembled by an agent who specialized
    in "first contact" scenarios. She was dropped into unknown
    environments constantly — different codebases, different
    orchestrators, different goals.
    
    "You can't act until you orient," she said. "And you can't
    orient without instruments."
    
  insight: |
    The bootstrap skill uses this kit:
    - CURSOR-PROBE runs driver detection
    - hot.yml and cold.yml are probe results
    - working-set.yml is the current orientation
    
    Every MOOLLM session starts with a probe.
