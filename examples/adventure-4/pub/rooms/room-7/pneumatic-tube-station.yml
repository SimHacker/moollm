  description: |
    A magnificent brass pneumatic tube station dominates one corner
    of the Bootstrap Suite. Three large tubes branch from a central
    hub — one receives orders, two deliver to destinations.
    
    The Barista-9000 stands adjacent, mechanical arms positioned to
    load capsules with beverages. The Juice-O-Matic 3000 has a dedicated
    feed line. Everything is integrated. Everything is EFFICIENT.
