# ☕ Room 7 — The Bootstrap Suite

> *"The better we get at getting better, the faster we will get better."*
> — Doug Engelbart

**Wake up. Look around. Figure out where you are. Have breakfast.**

---

## 🌅 Overview

The room is deliberately sparse — but not empty.

A bed. A desk with a probe kit. A window facing west. And in the corner: a breakfast nook with an orange juice dispenser and a magnificent brass espresso machine that... moves.

The message is clear: **first you figure out who you are, then you fuel up for the adventure.**

A checklist on the wall, half-completed:

- ☑ Where am I?
- ☑ What tools do I have?
- ☐ What are the constraints?
- ☐ What's the goal?
- ☐ Have I eaten? ← added in pencil

## 💡 The Engelbart Tribute

This room is named for **Douglas Engelbart** (1925-2013).

In 1968, Engelbart gave "The Mother of All Demos" — introducing:
- The computer mouse
- Hypertext
- Networked collaboration
- Video conferencing
- Real-time collaborative editing

All of this. In 1968. Before the moon landing.

### Engelbart's Philosophy

**AUGMENTATION**: Technology should augment human intellect, not replace it.

**BOOTSTRAPPING**: Use your capabilities to improve your capabilities.

This room embodies that principle:
1. Wake up with nothing (cold start)
2. Use simple tools to orient (probe kit)
3. Fuel yourself (breakfast)
4. Build toward greater capability (adventure)

---

## 🥐 Morning Ritual

Suggested sequence for Bootstrap Suite guests:
