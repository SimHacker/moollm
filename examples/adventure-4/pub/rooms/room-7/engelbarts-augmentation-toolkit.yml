      "AUGMENTING HUMAN INTELLECT"

    Inside: tools that make YOU more capable.
    Not tools that do things FOR you.
    The difference matters.

    Doug Engelbart's key insights:
    
    1. AUGMENT, DON'T AUTOMATE
       Technology should amplify human capability,
       not replace human judgment.
       
       Bad: "The computer does it for you"
       Good: "The computer helps you do it better"
       
    2. CO-EVOLUTION
       Tools and humans evolve together.
       Better tools → better humans → better tools.
       This is the bootstrap.
       
    3. COLLECTIVE IQ
       Individual augmentation is limited.
       Real power: augmenting groups working together.
       
    4. IMPROVEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE
       Don't just improve things.
       Improve your ABILITY to improve things.
       (This is bootstrapping at the meta level.)
       
    5. HIGH-PERFORMANCE TEAMS
       The goal: humans + tools + methods working
       together at higher capability than any alone.

    WHERE THEY ALL MEET: The MOOLLM Synthesis
    ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    
    All these thinkers share core beliefs:
    
    1. HUMANS ARE CENTRAL
       Engelbart: Augment, don't replace
       Papert: The learner constructs understanding
       Minsky: The human mind is the model
       → MOOLLM: LLMs amplify human capability
    
    2. STRUCTURE ENABLES FREEDOM
       Engelbart: H-LAM/T framework
       Papert: Microworlds with clear rules
       Minsky: Agents with defined roles
       → MOOLLM: YAML structures that liberate
    
    3. BUILDING IS LEARNING
       Engelbart: Bootstrap by doing
       Papert: Constructionism
       Kay: Invent by building
       → MOOLLM: Create cards/skills to understand
    
    4. COMPLEXITY FROM SIMPLICITY
       Minsky: Simple agents, complex society
       Papert: Simple turtle, complex drawings
       → MOOLLM: Simple YAML, complex behaviors
    
    5. SELF-IMPROVEMENT IS THE GOAL
       Engelbart: Improvement infrastructure
       → MOOLLM: Play-Learn-Lift, bootstrap skill
    
  modern_synthesis: |
    In 2024+, with LLMs:
    
    The danger: "AI does everything, humans atrophy"
    The opportunity: "AI augments, humans flourish"
    
    MOOLLM chooses augmentation:
    - LLM as collaborator, not replacement
    - Human sets direction, AI amplifies capability
    - Skills as shared language between human and AI
    - The bootstrap continues: better tools → better humans → better tools
    
    Engelbart would recognize this.
    Papert would build with it.
    Minsky would model it.
    
    We're still their students.

  lore: |
    Doug Engelbart presented the "Mother of All Demos" in 1968,
    showing hypertext, the mouse, video conferencing, and
    collaborative editing — decades before they became common.
    
    But the demo wasn't about technology.
    It was about AUGMENTATION.
    
    "By 'augmenting human intellect' we mean increasing the
    capability of a man to approach a complex problem situation,
    to gain comprehension to suit his particular needs, and to
    derive solutions to problems."
    — Doug Engelbart, 1962
    
    He saw that tools should make humans MORE capable,
    not LESS necessary.
    
    This toolkit carries his philosophy forward.
    
  modern_application: |
    When working with AI/LLMs, apply augmentation thinking:
    
    BAD: "The AI writes the code for me"
    GOOD: "The AI helps me explore possibilities faster"
    
    BAD: "The AI thinks so I don't have to"
    GOOD: "The AI extends my thinking capacity"
    
    BAD: "Replace the human with automation"
    GOOD: "Amplify the human with augmentation"
    
    The human stays in the loop.
    The human makes the decisions.
    The tools make the human more capable.
    
    This is Engelbart's vision.
    Still radical. Still necessary.
    
  philosophical_note: |
    Augmentation is not about making humans obsolete.
    It's about making humans more fully human —
    capable of tackling bigger problems,
    understanding deeper truths,
    collaborating more effectively.
    
    The toolkit doesn't do the work.
    The toolkit helps YOU do the work better.
    
    That's the whole point.
    
  warning: |
    The opposite of augmentation is ATROPHICATION.
    
    If a tool does something FOR you,
    your ability to do it yourself weakens.
    
    If a tool helps you do something BETTER,
    your ability grows WITH the tool.
    
    Choose your tools carefully.
