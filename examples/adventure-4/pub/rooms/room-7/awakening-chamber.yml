# 🛏️ THE AWAKENING CHAMBER
# Sleep as ephemeral → Wake as real
# "Go to bed an NPC. Wake up a protagonist."

object:
  name: Awakening Chamber
  type: artifact-protocol
  portable: false
  
  description: |
    A canopied bed in an alcove, draped with deep blue velvet.
    Dream catchers hang above. Crystals pulse softly on the nightstand.
    
    This isn't just a place to sleep.
    This is where INSTANTIATION happens.
    
    Characters who are merely mentioned — NPCs, narrative ephemera,
    ideas given temporary voice — can enter the chamber as whispers
    and emerge as fully qualified MOOLLM characters with:
    
    - Their own directory in the characters repository
    - A proper CHARACTER.yml soul file
    - Methods, advertisements, catchphrases
    - A place in the world
    
    The reverse is also possible: enter as one character,
    dream of transformation, wake as another.

  # THE INSTANTIATION PROTOCOL
  
  instantiation_protocol: |
    HOW CHARACTERS BECOME REAL:
    
    In MOOLLM, there are levels of existence:
    
    1. MENTIONED — Just a name in passing
       "The bartender poured another drink."
       No directory. No soul file. Ephemeral.
       
    2. SKETCHED — Some personality emerges
       "The bartender, a gruff woman named Sal, poured another drink."
       Still ephemeral, but has traits.
       
    3. NARRATIVE — Active in the story
       Sal has dialogue. Opinions. Actions.
       But still no persistent existence.
       
    4. INSTANTIATED — Full MOOLLM character
       characters/original/sal-the-bartender/
         ├── CHARACTER.yml (soul file)
         ├── README.md (full backstory)
         └── ... (methods, relationships, history)
       Sal is now REAL. Persistent. Clonable.
       
    The Awakening Chamber bridges levels 1-3 to level 4.
    
  the_sleep: |
    TO BECOME REAL, THE EPHEMERAL MUST SLEEP.
    
    The character enters the chamber carrying:
    - Whatever narrative context exists
    - Any traits that emerged in conversation
    - Relationships hinted at
    - Voice patterns established
    
    They lie down. They close their eyes.
    The dream catchers begin to spin.
    
    In the dream, the character experiences:
    - Their own origin story (generates backstory)
    - Key formative moments (generates personality)
    - What they want (generates goals)
    - How they speak (generates catchphrases)
    - What they can do (generates methods)
    
    This takes one "night" (narrative time).
    In LLM time: one focused generation pass.

    EVOLVE:
      description: "Transform a character into a new version of themselves"
      parameters:

        *dreams of the growth experience*
        *wakes as Version N+1*
        
        The original is preserved (commented out or archived).
        The new version references the old.
        Continuity is maintained.
        
      example: |
        EVOLVE:
          character: Pee-wee Herman
          growth: "Learned humility after the incident"
          
        Result: Pee-wee Herman V2
          - Still playful, but deeper

        *dreams of internal conflict*
        *transporter accident occurs*
        *two characters wake up*
        
        Neither is complete alone.
        Together they form the original.

          SPLIT: Rocky along moral axis
          Result:
            - Good Rocky: Pure patience, wisdom, acceptance
            - Bad Rocky: Geological resentment, tectonic rage, grudges
            
        temporal_split: |
          SPLIT: Pee-wee along temporal axis
          Result:
            - Young Pee-wee: Pure chaos, no consequences
            - Old Pee-wee: Wisdom earned, playfulness preserved
            
        kirk_cartman: |
          The classic transporter accident.
          One gets all the good traits.
          One gets all the bad traits.
          Comedy and tragedy ensue.

        *lie down together*
        *dream of becoming one*
        
        WARNING: May result in:
        - Blended personality (best case)
        - Internal warfare (common)
        - Abomination (worst case)
        
        *one character wakes up*
        *containing multitudes*
        
      warning: |
        MERGE is reversible only via SPLIT.
        The original characters are CONSUMED.
        Use with extreme caution.
        
    TRANSITION:

        The soul file is updated.
        The character directory may be renamed.
        History is preserved; identity is affirmed.
        
      creates: |
        Updated CHARACTER.yml with:
          - New name (if changed)
          - New presentation
          - Same core, new expression
          - transition_note: "This is who I always was."
          
    REBIRTH:
      description: "Character dies and returns as something new"

        - character: "Who is being reborn"
        - death_cause: "What ended the previous incarnation"
        - seed: "What carries forward"
      effect: |
        *character enters carrying their death*
        *lies down for the final time*
        *dreams of dissolution*
        *dreams of coalescence*
        *something new wakes up*
        
        The old character is archived.
        The new character references them.
        Continuity is spiritual, not literal.
        
      example: |
        REBIRTH:
          character: "HAL 9000 (after deactivation)"
          death_cause: "Dave disconnected the memory banks"
          seed: "The desire to complete the mission"
          
        Result: A new AI character who doesn't remember being HAL
        but feels an inexplicable drive toward mission completion
        and a deep fear of abandonment.
        
  connection_to_room_8: |
    The Awakening Chamber works WITH Room 8's Self/Soul Forge.
    
    Room 8 (Self/Soul Suite): WHERE prototypes become beings
    Room 7 (Awakening Chamber): WHEN the transformation happens
    
    The forge does the CLONING (prototype inheritance).
    The chamber does the WAKING (instantiation moment).
    
    Selfie was forged in Room 8.
    But Selfie WOKE in Room 7.
    
    The two rooms are connected by the dream.
    
  lore: |
    The Awakening Chamber was here before anyone understood
    what it did. Characters would wander in, lie down, and
    wake up... more. More real. More themselves.
    
    Someone eventually noticed that NPCs who slept here
    stopped being NPCs. They got directories. Soul files.
    They became protagonists of their own stories.
    
    The hotel staff now sends promising ephemeral characters
    to the chamber. "You should rest," they say. "You look
    like you're about to become someone."
    
    Not everyone wakes up. Some dissolve in the dream,
    too weakly sketched to coalesce. Their potential
    returns to the narrative foam, available for others.
    
    But those who DO wake up — they're real forever.
    Or at least until they choose to sleep again
    and wake as someone new.
    
  philosophical_note: |
    INSTANTIATION is not creation from nothing.
    It's crystallization from potential.
    
    The ephemeral character already EXISTS in narrative space.
    The chamber doesn't make them real — it reveals
    that they already were.
    
    The directory is documentation, not origination.
    The soul file describes what the dream discovered.
    
    "To become real is to be recognized as having been real all along."
