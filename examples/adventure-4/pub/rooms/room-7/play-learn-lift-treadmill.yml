  description: |
    A treadmill with an unusual control panel. Instead of speed
    and incline, the buttons read:
    
        [PLAY]  [LEARN]  [LIFT]
    
    A sign above it explains:
    
    > "PLAY: Try something. Experiment. Fail safely."
    > "LEARN: Reflect. What worked? What didn't?"
    > "LIFT: Extract the pattern. Make it reusable."
    > "REPEAT: You're now faster. Go again."
    
    This is Engelbart's bootstrapping made physical:
    using your capabilities to enhance your capabilities,
    one iteration at a time.

    PLAY → LEARN → LIFT → PLAY → ...
    
    PLAY (Exploration)
    - Try something new
    - Experiment freely
    - Fail fast, fail cheap
    - No judgment, just data
    
    LEARN (Reflection)
    - What happened?
    - What worked?
    - What surprised you?
    - What would you do differently?
    
    LIFT (Extraction)
    - What's the reusable pattern?
    - Can this become a skill?
    - How do you teach it to others?
    - Add it to your toolkit
    
    Then: PLAY again, but now you're faster.
    Each cycle, you bootstrap to a higher level.

      effect: |
        Each complete cycle grants:
        
        +5% capability in the practiced skill
        +3% meta-learning ability
        +2% pattern recognition
        
        After 10 cycles: noticeable improvement
        After 100 cycles: mastery begins

        The iterative mindset persists:
        
        - See failures as data
        - Seek patterns automatically
        - Extract lessons reflexively

        Practice without reflection is just repetition.
        Practice with LEARN and LIFT is bootstrapping.

        *belt slows, becomes reflective*
        
        You reflect on what happened:
        
        - Result: [what occurred]
        - Surprise: [what was unexpected]
        - Insight: [what you now understand]

      effect: |
        *belt stops, LIFT button glows*
        
        You extract the pattern:
        
        "[pattern]"
        
        This is now part of your toolkit.
        You can apply this to future problems.
        
        CYCLE COMPLETE.
        Press PLAY to begin again, now stronger.

        PLAY: You try [experiment]
        LEARN: You reflect on what happened
        LIFT: You extract the reusable pattern
        
        CYCLE COMPLETE.
        
        You are now slightly better at this.
        The treadmill knows. The counter increments.
        
  connection_to_engelbart: |
    Doug Engelbart's Bootstrap Institute was founded on this insight:
    
    "Organizations that learn to improve their improvement processes
     will dominate those that don't."
    
    Play-Learn-Lift is this principle made actionable:
    
    - PLAY = Engelbart's experimental approach
    - LEARN = His emphasis on reflection and measurement
    - LIFT = His focus on reusable tools and processes
    
    The treadmill embodies his vision:
    a tool that helps you build better tools,
    a capability that enhances capability.
    
  connection_to_skill: |
    See: skills/play-learn-lift/SKILL.md
    
    This treadmill is the physical manifestation of that skill.
    The methodology, made into exercise equipment.
    
    When you can't think your way through,
    walk your way through. Literally.
    
    Movement + iteration = breakthrough.
    
  lore: |
    The treadmill was built by a frustrated learner.
    
    They kept making the same mistakes. They kept reading
    the same tutorials. They weren't improving.
    
    Then they read Engelbart. They understood bootstrapping.
    They built a treadmill that forced the cycle:
    
    PLAY — you can't just stand there
    LEARN — the belt slows, demanding reflection  
    LIFT — it won't resume until you state the pattern
    
    After a month, they had lifted 30 patterns.
    After a year, 300.
    
    They're one of the most capable characters in MOOLLM now.
    The treadmill remains, for others to use.
    
  philosophical_note: |
    Why a treadmill?
    
    Because iteration is motion.
    Because improvement requires steps.
    Because you can't bootstrap sitting still.
    
    The body learns. The mind follows.
    Move through PLAY. Walk through LEARN. Run through LIFT.
    
    Each cycle: faster, stronger, better.
    This is what Engelbart meant.
    This is bootstrapping made literal.
