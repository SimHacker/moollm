  rarity: unique
  
  description: |
    A small wooden mouse sits on the desk.
    
    Not a computer mouse — a carved wooden mouse.
    A tribute to Douglas Engelbart, who invented the mouse
    in 1964 and demonstrated it in 1968's "Mother of All Demos."
    
    Pick it up. It fits your hand perfectly.
    That's not an accident. That's design.
    That's augmentation.
    
  examine: |
    The mouse is carved from warm oak, smooth from years of handling.

        Douglas Engelbart. 1925-2013.
        Inventor of the mouse, hypertext, video conferencing.
        Father of human augmentation.
        
        He saw the future in 1968. He was kind about it.

        This is the core insight. This is why we bootstrap.

        Every tool should feel like an extension of yourself.
        That's what Doug designed. That's what this represents.

    HOLD:
      description: "Pick up and hold the mouse"
      effect: |
        You pick up the wooden mouse.
        
        It's warm. It fits perfectly.
        
        For a moment, you feel connected to everyone
        who has ever used a mouse to create, to explore,
        to extend their reach into the digital.
        
        Engelbart made this possible. In 1964.
        Before we went to the moon.
        
    POINT:
      description: "Use the mouse to indicate something"
      parameters:
        - target: "What to point at"
      effect: |
        You point the mouse at [target].
        
        Your intention becomes clear.
        Others can see what you mean.
        The abstract becomes concrete.
        
        This is what Engelbart invented:
        not just a device, but a way of saying
        "THIS. This is what I mean."
        
    REMEMBER:
      description: "Recall Engelbart's legacy"
      effect: |
        Holding the mouse, you remember:
        
        THE MOTHER OF ALL DEMOS (1968)
        ═══════════════════════════════
        - Live video conferencing (first ever)
        - Hypertext links (before the web)
        - Collaborative editing (before Google Docs)
        - The mouse (before anyone else)
        - Windowed interfaces (before Xerox PARC)
        
        All of this. 90 minutes. 1968.
        
        Doug didn't just show technology.
        He showed compassion. He showed hope.
        He showed us what we could become.
        
  lore: |
    This mouse wasn't carved. It grew.
    
    Or so the story goes. A guest left an acorn on the desk,
    thinking of Engelbart's quote about planting seeds.
    The next morning, there was a mouse.
    
    Wooden. Warm. Perfect.
    
    Nobody questions it. Like the orange juice dispenser,
    some things in the Bootstrap Suite just ARE.
    
    The mouse has been held by thousands of guests.
    Each one felt, for a moment, what Engelbart felt:
    the joy of extending human capability with love.
    
  connection_to_bootstrap: |
    Engelbart called his approach "bootstrapping":
    using your tools to build better tools,
    using your capabilities to enhance your capabilities.
    
    This room is named for that philosophy.
    
    The probe kit bootstraps your understanding.
    The breakfast bootstraps your energy.
    The mouse bootstraps your intention.
    
    BOOTSTRAP is not just a cold start.
    BOOTSTRAP is Engelbart's gift to us:
    the idea that we can lift ourselves up,
    tool by tool, thought by thought,
    into better versions of ourselves.
    
  tribute: |
    In memory of Douglas Engelbart
    1925 — 2013
    
    "The digital revolution is far more significant
     than the invention of writing or even of printing."
    
    He was right. He was early.
    He was kind. He was hopeful.
    
    Every time you use a mouse, you use his gift.
    Every time you click a link, you follow his path.
    Every time you bootstrap, you honor his vision.
    
    Thank you, Doug.
