room:
  name: "The Bootstrap Suite"
  id: room-7
  number: 7
  theme: bootstrap
  
  tagline: "Wake up. Look around. Figure out where you are. Have breakfast."
  
  description: |
    The room is deliberately sparse — but not empty.
    
    A bed. A desk with a probe kit. A window facing west.
    And in the corner: a breakfast nook with an orange juice dispenser.
    
    The message is clear: first you figure out who you are,
    then you fuel up for the adventure.
    
    A checklist on the wall, half-completed:
    
    ☑ Where am I?
    ☑ What tools do I have?
    ☐ What are the constraints?
    ☐ What's the goal?
    ☐ Have I eaten?  ← added in pencil
    
    Above the bed:
    
    > "The bootstrap sequence is the first conversation
    > between agent and environment."
    
    Above the breakfast nook:
    
    > "You can't bootstrap on an empty stomach."
    > — Ancient wisdom, added by a hungry guest
    
    The orange juice dispenser hums quietly. It's always full.
    Nobody knows how. Nobody questions it.
    
  ideal_guest: |
    Characters who start cold. Those comfortable with uncertainty.
    Explorers, scouts, agents who specialize in first contact.
    Also: anyone who needs breakfast before they can think.

  atmosphere: |
    Sparse but welcoming. The room knows you just woke up.
    It doesn't overwhelm. It provides what you need:
    - A place to orient (desk)
    - A place to fuel (nook)
    - A place to plan (both)

  morning_ritual: |
    Suggested sequence for Bootstrap Suite guests:
    
    1. WAKE — In the Awakening Chamber above
    2. DESCEND — Ladder down to Room 7
    3. PROBE — Check the environment (desk)
    4. FUEL — Orange juice, toast, coffee
    5. PLAN — Use the breakfast nook to strategize
    6. LAUNCH — Exit to begin the adventure
    
  lore: |
    The breakfast nook was added by a guest who kept
    trying to probe the environment before eating.
    
    They would stumble around, confused, hungry, ineffective.
    "I can't THINK," they complained. "I can't ORIENT."
    
    A kind innkeeper installed the juice dispenser.
    "Try again," they said. "After breakfast."
    
    The guest drank. They ate toast. They had coffee.
    Suddenly the probe kit made sense. The map was readable.
    The cold start became warm.
    
    They never forgot the lesson:
    BOOTSTRAP needs FUEL. BOOT needs BREAKFAST.
    
    The dispenser has been here ever since. Always full.
    Nobody knows who refills it. The innkeeper just smiles.

  namesake: |
    This room is named for Douglas Engelbart (1925-2013).
    
    In 1968, Engelbart gave "The Mother of All Demos" — a 90-minute
    presentation that introduced:
    - The computer mouse
    - Hypertext
    - Networked collaboration
    - Video conferencing
    - Dynamic file linking
    - Real-time collaborative editing
    
    All of this. In 1968. Before the moon landing.
    
  engelbart_philosophy: |
    Engelbart didn't just invent tools. He invented a philosophy:
    
    AUGMENTATION
    ════════════
    Technology should augment human intellect, not replace it.
    The goal is not artificial intelligence that thinks FOR us,
    but tools that help us think BETTER.
    
    "The better we get at getting better, the faster we will
    get better." — Doug Engelbart
    
    BOOTSTRAPPING
    ═════════════
    Engelbart's team at SRI used their own tools to build
    better tools. They called this "bootstrapping" — using
    your capabilities to improve your capabilities.
    
    This room embodies that principle:
    - Wake up with nothing (cold start)
    - Use simple tools to orient (probe kit)
    - Fuel yourself (breakfast)
    - Build toward greater capability (adventure)
    
    COMPASSION
    ══════════
    Engelbart believed technology should serve humanity's
    most pressing challenges. He cared about the future.
    He wanted us to get better at getting better.
    
    The breakfast nook is here because Engelbart would have
    understood: you can't augment a starving mind.
    
  nls_tribute: |
    NLS (oN-Line System) was Engelbart's creation.
    
    It demonstrated that computers could be:
    - Interactive (not batch processing)
    - Collaborative (not isolated)
    - Augmenting (not replacing)
    - Humane (not hostile)
    
    Every tool in this room echoes NLS:
    - The probe kit is interactive exploration
    - The map is collaborative knowledge
    - The journal is augmented memory
    - The breakfast is humane design
    
  mouse_in_the_room: |
    There's a small wooden mouse on the desk.
    
    Not a computer mouse — a carved wooden mouse.
    A tribute to Engelbart's invention.
    
    Pick it up. It fits your hand perfectly.
    That's not an accident. That's design.
    That's augmentation.
    
    Engelbart designed the mouse to extend the hand
    into the digital realm. To make the computer
    respond to gesture, to pointing, to human intention.
    
    The wooden mouse reminds us: every tool should
    feel like an extension of ourselves.
