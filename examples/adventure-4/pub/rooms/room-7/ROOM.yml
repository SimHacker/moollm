  tagline: "Wake up. Look around. Figure out where you are. Have breakfast."

    The room is deliberately sparse — but not empty.
    
    A bed. A desk with a probe kit. A window facing west.
    And in the corner: a breakfast nook with an orange juice dispenser.
    
    The message is clear: first you figure out who you are,
    then you fuel up for the adventure.
    
    A checklist on the wall, half-completed:
    
    ☑ Where am I?
    ☑ What tools do I have?
    ☐ What are the constraints?
    ☐ What's the goal?
    ☐ Have I eaten?  ← added in pencil
    
    Above the bed:
    
    > "The boot sequence is the first conversation
    > between agent and environment."
    
    Above the breakfast nook:
    
    > "You can't bootstrap on an empty stomach."
    > — Ancient wisdom, added by a hungry guest
    
    The orange juice dispenser hums quietly. It's always full.
    Nobody knows how. Nobody questions it.
    
  ideal_guest: |
    Characters who start cold. Those comfortable with uncertainty.
    Explorers, scouts, agents who specialize in first contact.
    Also: anyone who needs breakfast before they can think.

  atmosphere: |
    Sparse but welcoming. The room knows you just woke up.
    It doesn't overwhelm. It provides what you need:
    - A place to orient (desk)
    - A place to fuel (nook)
    - A place to plan (both)

    Suggested sequence for Bootstrap Suite guests:
    
    1. WAKE — In the Awakening Chamber above
    2. DESCEND — Ladder down to Room 7
    3. PROBE — Check the environment (desk)
    4. FUEL — Orange juice, toast, coffee
    5. PLAN — Use the breakfast nook to strategize
    6. LAUNCH — Exit to begin the adventure
    
  lore: |
    The breakfast nook was added by a guest who kept
    trying to probe the environment before eating.
    
    They would stumble around, confused, hungry, ineffective.
    "I can't THINK," they complained. "I can't ORIENT."
    
    A kind innkeeper installed the juice dispenser.
    "Try again," they said. "After breakfast."
    
    The guest drank. They ate toast. They had coffee.
    Suddenly the probe kit made sense. The map was readable.
    The cold start became warm.
    
    They never forgot the lesson:
    BOOTSTRAP needs FUEL. BOOT needs BREAKFAST.
    
    The dispenser has been here ever since. Always full.
    Nobody knows who refills it. The innkeeper just smiles.
