    The room is deliberately sparse. A bed, a desk, a window.
    But on the desk: a probe kit. Everything you need to figure
    out an unfamiliar environment.
    
    A checklist on the wall, half-completed:
    
    ☑ Where am I?
    ☑ What tools do I have?
    ☐ What are the constraints?
    ☐ What's the goal?
    
    Above the bed:
    
    > "The boot sequence is the first conversation
    > between agent and environment."
    
  ideal_guest: |
    Characters who start cold. Those comfortable with uncertainty.
    Explorers, scouts, agents who specialize in first contact.
