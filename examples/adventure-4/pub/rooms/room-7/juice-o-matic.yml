    What was once a simple orange juice dispenser has EVOLVED.
    
    The Juice-O-Matic 3000 now features a rotating carousel of
    fresh fruits, a blending station, an ice crusher, and tubes
    connecting directly to the pneumatic delivery system.
    
    Glass chambers display the options:
    
      🍊 ORANGE    🍋 GRAPEFRUIT   🍏 APPLE
      🍇 GRAPE     🍓 BERRY MIX    🥭 TROPICAL
      
      🥤 SMOOTHIES    🧊 ICEYS    🍹 FRESH BLENDS
    
    A small plaque reads:
    
    > "VITAMIN C FOR VITAMIN SEE"
    > "Now with Vitamin A, B, D, E, and AWESOME"
    > "Clarity starts with citrus — Adventure continues with EVERYTHING ELSE"
    
    It's always full. Of EVERYTHING. Nobody knows how.
    Nobody questions it anymore.

    The Juice-O-Matic 3000 is a marvel of beverage engineering:

    POUR:
      description: "Get a glass of orange juice"
      parameters:
        - size: "small | medium | large | just-keep-pouring"
      effect: |
        *tap opens*
        *juice flows, golden and bright*
        
        You fill a glass with [size] orange juice.
        
        The level in the dispenser...
        ...remains exactly the same.
        
        Don't question it. Just drink.
        
    SIP:
      description: "Take a drink"
      effect: |
        *cool, sweet, perfect*
        
        The juice tastes like:
        - Sunshine (bottled)
        - Optimism (liquid)
        - Someone believing in you (citrus form)
        
        You feel better. You feel ready.
        The cold start is warming up.
        
    REFILL:
      description: "Try to refill the dispenser"
      effect: |
        You approach with more oranges.
        
        The dispenser is already full.
        
        You look away. You look back.
        Still full. Your oranges are unnecessary.
        
        The dispenser appreciates the thought, though.
        
  lore: |
    Nobody installed the dispenser. It was just... here one day.
    
    The first guest to notice it was having a terrible cold start.
    Confused, disoriented, unable to make sense of the probe kit.
    They saw the dispenser. They poured a glass. They drank.
    
    Everything clicked into place.
    
    "Was that always there?" they asked.
    "Was what always where?" replied the innkeeper.
    
    The dispenser has been here ever since. Or always.
    The distinction doesn't seem to matter.
    What matters: the juice is fresh, and it helps.
    
  mystery: |
    Theories about the dispenser:
    
    1. The hotel generates it (metabolism of the building)
    2. A very dedicated ghost squeezes oranges (spiritual labor)
    3. It's connected to a citrus dimension (portal theory)
    4. The juice is an illusion but the clarity is real (placebo++)
    5. Don't ask, just drink (pragmatist position)
    
    Theory #5 has the most adherents.
