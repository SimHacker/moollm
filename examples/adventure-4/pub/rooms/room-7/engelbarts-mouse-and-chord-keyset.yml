  name: Engelbart's Mouse & Chord Keyset
  type: artifact-pair
  portable: true
  rarity: legendary
  
  description: |
    Two wooden devices sit on the desk, clearly a matched pair.
    
    RIGHT HAND: A three-button mouse, carved from oak.
    LEFT HAND: A five-key chord keyset, also oak.
    
    This was Engelbart's complete input system for NLS:
    - The mouse for POINTING (selection, navigation)
    - The chord keyset for TYPING (any character with key combos)
    
    Together, your hands never leave the input devices.
    Together, you can do anything.
    
    A brass plaque between them reads:
    
    > "AUGMENTING HUMAN INTELLECT"
    > "Stanford Research Institute, 1968"

  the_chord_keyset: |
    The chord keyset is the forgotten half of Engelbart's vision.
    
    Everyone remembers the mouse. Few remember the chords.
    
    HOW IT WORKS:
    5 keys, pressed in combinations (like piano chords):
    
    Key 1 alone = 'a'
    Key 2 alone = 'b'  
    Key 1+2 together = 'c'
    Key 1+2+3 = 'd'
    ... and so on
    
    With 5 keys, you have 31 possible combinations (2^5 - 1).
    That's enough for:
    - Full alphabet (26 letters)
    - Numbers (shift mode)
    - Commands (control mode)
    
    WHY CHORDS:
    - One hand stays on mouse (pointing)
    - One hand types without looking (chording)
    - No reaching for keyboard
    - Flow stays unbroken
    - Speed increases with practice
    
    Engelbart's team became incredibly fast.
    They could think in chords.
    
  state:
    mouse_warmth: "Matches hand temperature"
    keyset_warmth: "Same oak, same warmth"
    last_chord: "1+3+5 = 'hello'"
    
  buffs:
    DUAL_CHANNEL_INPUT:
      duration: "while using both"
      effect: |
        +30% input efficiency (no hand switching)
        +25% flow state probability
        +20% thought-to-action speed
        
        Your right hand points. Your left hand speaks.
        Together, you channel intention into action
        without breaking flow.
        
    CHORD_MEMORY:
      duration: "permanent after practice"
      effect: |
        After 100 chords: muscle memory begins
        After 1000 chords: you stop thinking about keys
        After 10000 chords: you think in chords
        
        The keyset becomes an extension of language.
        
    ENGELBART_WISDOM:
      duration: "while contemplating"
      effect: |
        Holding both devices, you understand:
        
        - Technology should AUGMENT, not replace
        - Input should feel like extension of thought
        - Speed comes from removing friction
        - The goal is flow, not features

        Douglas Engelbart. 1925-2013.
        
        Everyone remembers the mouse.
        Few remember the chord keyset.
        Together, they were his complete vision.

      response: |
        The mouse points. The keyset types.
        Hands never leave. Flow never breaks.
        This is augmentation.
        
  methods:
    HOLD:
      description: "Pick up both devices"
      effect: |
        You pick up the mouse in your right hand.
        You rest your left fingers on the chord keyset.
        
        They're warm. They fit perfectly.
        
        For a moment, you feel what Engelbart's team felt:
        the joy of fluid thought-to-action,
        the power of unbroken flow.
        
    POINT:
      description: "Use the mouse to indicate"
      parameters:
        - target: "What to point at"
      effect: |
        Your right hand moves the mouse.
        The cursor points at [target].
        
        Click: select.
        Double-click: open.
        Three buttons: more options than you need.
        
    CHORD:
      description: "Type using chord combinations"
      parameters:
        - text: "What to type"
      effect: |
        Your left hand plays the chords:
        
        [chord sequence plays]
        
        "[text]" appears, typed without looking,
        without reaching, without breaking flow.
        
        Your right hand never left the mouse.
        
    COMMAND:
      description: "Issue a command via chord"
      parameters:
        - command: "The command to execute"
      effect: |
        Shift to command mode (key 5 held)
        Chord the command...
        
        [command] executes.
        
        In NLS, this is how you:
        - Created links
        - Moved text
        - Structured documents
        - Collaborated in real-time
        
        All in 1968.
        
  lore: |
    The mouse gets all the credit. The keyset was forgotten.
    
    But Engelbart always demonstrated them together.
    In the Mother of All Demos, watch his left hand:
    it's always on the chord keyset, always typing,
    while his right hand points and selects.
    
    His team at SRI became virtuosos. They could
    think and act simultaneously, left and right
    working in harmony, flow unbroken.
    
    When the mouse was commercialized, the keyset was dropped.
    "Too hard to learn," they said.
    "Users want simplicity," they said.
    
    Engelbart was disappointed. Half his vision was lost.
    
    This wooden pair is a reminder of what could have been.
    What still could be.
    
  learning_curve: |
    The chord keyset IS harder to learn than a keyboard.
    But it's faster once learned.
    
    Day 1: Frustration. "Why can't I just type?"
    Week 1: Slow progress. Basic chords memorized.
    Month 1: Speed matches keyboard. Flow begins.
    Month 3: Speed exceeds keyboard. Flow is constant.
    Year 1: You think in chords. The keyset disappears.
    
    Most people quit at Day 1.
    Engelbart's team pushed through.
    They achieved augmentation.
    
  tribute: |
    In memory of Douglas Engelbart
    1925 — 2013
    
    He gave us the mouse.
    He also gave us the chord keyset.
    
    We kept the half that was easy.
    We forgot the half that was powerful.
    
    This paired artifact remembers both.
    
  connection_to_vim: |
    Vim users understand chord philosophy.
    
    'dw' = delete word (two keys, one action)
    'ciw' = change inner word (three keys, complex action)
    
    Engelbart's chords are the same principle:
    multiple keys, one intention, no reaching.
    
    Modal editing is Engelbart's ghost, still teaching.
