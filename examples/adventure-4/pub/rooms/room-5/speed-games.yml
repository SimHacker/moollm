  lore: |
    The Speed Games Cabinet was assembled by a game designer
    who realized something profound:
    
    "Multi-agent games are multi-turn simulations.
    Traditional systems treat each turn as an API call.
    That's carrier pigeon protocol for games.
    
    What if all turns happened in narrative?
    What if the context window was the game board?
    What if we played at speed of light?"
    
    These games were chosen for maximum round count
    and maximum player interaction — precisely the cases
    where speed of light shines brightest.
