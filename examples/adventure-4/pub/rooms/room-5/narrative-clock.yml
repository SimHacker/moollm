    A grandfather clock with unusual behavior.
    
    Its hands don't move at constant speed.
    When the room is full of action — games, debates, songs —
    the hands race forward.
    When nothing happens, they barely move.
    
    A small plaque reads:
    
    > "NARRATIVE TIME
    > 1 dramatic beat = 1 tick
    > 33 Fluxx turns = 33 ticks
    > 99 bottles = 99 ticks
    > Waiting for API response = 0 ticks"
    
  examine: |
    You examine the Narrative Clock.
    
    The face has unusual markings:
    
    - 12 o'clock: "CLIMAX"
    - 3 o'clock: "RISING ACTION"
    - 6 o'clock: "INCITING INCIDENT"
    - 9 o'clock: "RESOLUTION"
    
    The current time reads: "ACT II, SCENE 3"
    
    A dial on the side shows:
    
    CURRENT NARRATIVE DENSITY:
    ████████░░ 80%
    
    (A game is in progress. Time is moving fast.)
    
    When you step away, the hands slow.
    When you engage, they accelerate.
    The clock measures story, not seconds.

        "Time? What time? Story time.
        We measure in beats, not seconds.
        A 33-turn Fluxx game is 33 beats.
        A 99-bottle song is 99 beats.
        Wall time is... irrelevant."

      response: |
        *The hands nearly stop*
        
        "Nothing happening? The clock waits.
        Narrative time is patient.
        It only moves when story moves."

    CHECK-TIME:

      returns: |
        Act: [current act]
        Scene: [current scene]
        Dramatic beats today: [count]
        Narrative density: [percentage]
        
        "We are [fraction] through the story."
        
    MEASURE-SCENE:
      description: "How many narrative beats in a scene?"
      parameters:
        - scene_type: "What happened"
      returns: |
        Fluxx game (33 turns): 33 beats
        99 Bottles (full song): 99 beats
        Character debate: ~15 beats per topic
        Rocky contemplation: 1 beat (very dense)
        API round-trip wait: 0 beats (nothing happened)
        
    SPEED-COMPARE:
      description: "Compare narrative time to wall time"
      effect: |
        SPEED OF LIGHT:
        - Wall time: 30 seconds
        - Narrative beats: 99 (one song)
        - Ratio: 3.3 beats/second
        
        CARRIER PIGEON:
        - Wall time: 396 seconds
        - Narrative beats: 99 (same song)
        - Ratio: 0.25 beats/second
        
        Speed of light is 13x more narratively dense.
        More story per second. That's the principle.
        
    FAST-FORWARD:

      effect: |
        *The clock hands spin rapidly*
        
        "Skipping... skipping... 
        Nothing happened... nothing happened...
        AH! Here we are. Something interesting."
        
        (Narrative resumes at next dramatic beat)
        
  lore: |
    The Narrative Clock was a gift from a playwright
    who understood that time in stories is not time on walls.
    
    "A year can pass in a sentence," she said.
    "A second can take a chapter."
    
    In the Speed of Light Suite, the clock learned
    to measure what matters: dramatic beats.
    
    33 turns of Fluxx? 33 beats.
    99 verses of a song? 99 beats.
    Waiting for an API response? Zero beats.
    
    The clock doesn't count waiting.
    The clock counts doing.
    
  philosophical_note: |
    The Narrative Clock embodies a truth about stories:
    
    Time is measured in events, not seconds.
    A dense scene has more time than an empty hour.
    Speed of light simulation is narratively dense.
    Carrier pigeon protocol is narratively sparse.
    
    The clock asks: "What happened?"
    Not: "How long did you wait?"
