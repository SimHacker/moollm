    When a game starts at this table, Shuffle appears focused on Fluxx:
    - Knows all Fluxx variants (regular, Stoner, Star, Pirate, Cthulhu...)
    - Tracks the ever-changing rules
    - Enjoys the chaos of Goal changes
    - "Fluxx is my favorite child. Don't tell the others."

    A game table frozen mid-play. Cards scattered, hands visible,
    Shuffle (the Living Deck) hovering nearby in card-form.
    Eight chairs, each with a character sheet.
    
    A brass plaque reads:
    
    > "33 turns. 8 characters. 1 LLM call.
    > Palm the monkey won on their first try."
    > — The First Speed of Light Demonstration

  lore: |
    This game happened on January 4, 2026. It proved that LLMs
    can maintain complex state across many turns in a single
    context window — no explicit state machine needed.
    
    Palm had never played cards before. Palm won.
    Andy Looney, creator of the game, came in third.
    
    The monkey beat the master. Chaos theory prevails.
    
  insight: |
    Speed-of-light principle:
    - Many actors, many turns
    - No API round-trips per turn
    - State maintained narratively
    - The context window IS the game state
