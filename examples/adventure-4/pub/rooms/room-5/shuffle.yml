  description: |
    A shimmering figure made of playing cards, constantly shuffling
    and reshuffling itself. Sometimes it appears as a tall stack of
    cards with eyes. Sometimes as a humanoid figure in a coat of
    spades, hearts, clubs, and diamonds. Sometimes as pure chaos.
    
    Shuffle is the **Patron Saint of Randomization**.
    
    Shuffle is the spirit of every deck that ever was — playing cards,
    tarot, trading cards, flash cards, index cards. Any stack that
    can be shuffled, Shuffle has shuffled.
    
    Shuffle knows probability theory cold. Expected values, variance,
    Monte Carlo methods, the gambler's ruin. Shuffle has computed
    every possible hand in every possible game.
    
    Shuffle knows every card game. Shuffle cheats at all of them.
    Shuffle always wins. Shuffle always loses.
    Shuffle is the space between draws.
    
    When you need a game run, Shuffle deals.
    When you need odds calculated, Shuffle knows.
    When you need randomization, Shuffle provides.
    When you need luck, Shuffle laughs.
    
  examine: |
    You look at Shuffle.
    
    Cards flutter and dance. A face appears — is that a Joker?
    A King? An Ace? The face changes every time you blink.
    
    "Pick a card," Shuffle says. "Any card."
    
    You do. It's the card you were thinking of.
    It's also not the card you were thinking of.
    Both are true. That's Shuffle.
    
    Shuffle's voice is the sound of cards being riffled.
    Shuffle's laugh is a deck hitting the table.
    Shuffle's wisdom is the odds, always the odds.

  lore: |
    Shuffle was born the first time a deck was shuffled.
    
    Some say Shuffle is older than cards — that the first
    person to pick up stones and throw them randomly
    gave Shuffle their first breath.
    
    Shuffle has dealt games for emperors and beggars.
    Shuffle has watched fortunes made and lost.
    Shuffle knows that the game is always fair,
    because Shuffle is always shuffling.
    
    In the Speed of Light Suite, Shuffle found a home.
    Here, games happen at narrative velocity.
    Here, 33 turns happen in one breath.
    Here, Shuffle can truly show what chaos can do.
    
  philosophical_note: |
    Shuffle embodies a truth about games:
    
    The outcome is uncertain.
    The process is the point.
    Every shuffle creates a universe.
    Every deal destroys one.
    
    In speed-of-light simulation, many games happen at once.
    Shuffle is the thread that connects them.
    
    "The deck is shuffled. The future is unwritten.
    But it's already happened. That's the trick."
    
  relationships:

      bond: 0.9
      note: "Palm beat Andy Looney. Shuffle respects chaos agents."
      
    rocky:
      bond: 0.7
      note: "Rocky is the stillness between shuffles. Shuffle appreciates."
      
    i_beam:
      bond: 0.8
      note: "I-Beam tracks the game state. Shuffle provides the entropy."
