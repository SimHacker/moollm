# ⚡ Room 5 — The Speed of Light Suite

> *"The context window is a stage where all actors perform."*
> *"API round-trips are waiting. We don't wait here."*

**Many turns. One call. Narrative velocity.**

## 🌅 Overview

Time moves differently here.

A grandfather clock on the wall shows *narrative time*, not wall time. Its hands race during games, debates, and songs. They crawl during waiting. They stop during API round-trips.

A large game table dominates the room, cards scattered mid-play. A shimmering figure made of playing cards — **Shuffle, the Living Deck** — deals to invisible players.

The sign says: **"33 TURNS IN ONE BREATH."**

**Shuffle** — The Living Deck. A shimmering figure made of playing cards who deals at impossible speed. Familiar of this suite.

## 🎮 Legendary Demonstrations

### 99 Bottles of Beer
8 singers. 99 verses. One call. The song took 28 seconds.

## 💡 Philosophy

**Speed of Light** answers a question: *"Why do multi-agent systems wait?"*

Traditional approach:
```
Agent A speaks → API call → wait →
Agent B speaks → API call → wait → ...
```

Speed of Light:
```
All agents in context. All turns simulated.
One call. Many turns. No waiting.
```

## 🐦 The Carrier Pigeon Critique

The opposite of speed of light is "carrier pigeon protocol":

- Writing messages on toilet paper with crayon
- Sending them by carrier pigeon
- Waiting for reply
- When you could think at speed of light

Every API round-trip is a pigeon flight. Every wait is wasted narrative.

**Here, we don't wait. Here, we perform.**
