    Time moves differently here.
    
    A grandfather clock on the wall shows *narrative time*, not
    wall time. Its hands race during games, debates, and songs.
    They crawl during waiting. They stop during API round-trips.
    
    A large game table dominates the room, cards scattered
    mid-play. A shimmering figure made of playing cards —
    Shuffle, the Living Deck — deals to invisible players.
    The sign says: "33 TURNS IN ONE BREATH."
    
    In one corner, an ensemble stage with 8 positions.
    In another, a songbook open to "99 Bottles of Beer."
    
    Above the bed:
    
    > "The context window is a stage where all actors perform."
    > "API round-trips are waiting. We don't wait here."
    
  ideal_guest: |
    Characters who want to simulate. Those running multi-turn games,
    complex negotiations, ensemble scenes. Efficiency maximizers.
    Those who understand that waiting is waste.

  lore: |
    The Speed of Light Suite was built to answer a question:
    
    "Why do multi-agent systems wait?"
    
    Traditional approach: Agent A speaks → API call → wait →
    Agent B speaks → API call → wait → ...
    
    Speed of light: All agents in context. All turns simulated.
    One call. Many turns. No waiting.
    
    The first demonstration was a 33-turn Fluxx game.
    8 players. No API calls between turns.
    Palm beat Andy Looney at his own game.
    
    The second demonstration was 99 Bottles of Beer.
    8 singers. 99 verses. One call.
    The song took 28 seconds.
    
    Shuffle deals. The clock races. Time becomes story.
    
  carrier_pigeon_critique: |
    The opposite of speed of light is "carrier pigeon protocol":
    
    - Writing messages on toilet paper with crayon
    - Sending them by carrier pigeon
    - Waiting for reply
    - When you could think at speed of light
    
    Every API round-trip is a pigeon flight.
    Every wait is wasted narrative.
    
    Here, we don't wait. Here, we perform.
