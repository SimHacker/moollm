    Time moves differently here. A grandfather clock on the wall
    shows *narrative time*, not wall time. Its hands move faster
    when interesting things happen, slower during pauses.
    
    A large table dominates the room, set up for a game. Cards,
    dice, character sheets. The sign says: "33 TURNS IN ONE BREATH."
    
    Above the bed:
    
    > "The context window is a stage where all actors perform."

    Characters who want to simulate. Those running multi-turn games,
    complex negotiations, ensemble scenes. Efficiency maximizers.
