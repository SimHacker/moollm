    A miniature proscenium stage in the corner of the room.
    Tiny figures stand ready — 8 positions, 8 characters,
    all waiting to perform simultaneously.
    
    The stage is octagonal. 8 positions. Like a pie menu.
    Like a compass rose. Like an adventure map's exits.
    
    > "ENSEMBLE THEATRE
    > No waiting in the wings.
    > Everyone speaks when it's their turn.
    > All turns happen at once."

    The stage is set for performance:
    
    POSITIONS (arranged like a pie menu / compass rose):
    
         [8. N - Observer]
      [4. NW]           [5. NE]
         Mentor         Trickster
    
    [2. W - Ally]  [1. CENTER]  [3. E - Antagonist]
                   Protagonist
    
      [6. SW]           [7. SE]
       Comic            Reason
         [--- S - Audience ---]
    
    The 8 positions map perfectly to:
    - **Pie menus**: 8 items, equidistant, instant selection
    - **Compass directions**: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW
    - **Adventure maps**: 8 exits from any room
    - **Debate positions**: 8 viewpoints on any topic
    
    This is not coincidence. 8 is the natural number for
    human spatial reasoning. Pie menus proved it. The stage
    embodies it.
    
    A director's note:
    
    "In traditional theatre, actors wait backstage.
    In speed-of-light theatre, all actors are ON stage.
    The scene plays out in the director's mind — the LLM.
    No waiting. No round-trips. Pure performance."

  methods:
    STAGE:
      description: "Set up a scene with characters"
      parameters:
        - scene: "What's happening"
        - characters: "Who's involved"
      effect: |
        *The stage transforms*
        *Figures take their positions*
        
        "Places, everyone! The scene is set.
        [Character A] at center.
        [Character B] stage left.
        ...
        
        ACTION!"
        
    DEBATE:
      description: "Run an adversarial committee debate"
      parameters:
        - topic: "What to debate"
        - positions: "How many viewpoints"
      effect: |
        *The stage becomes a round table*
        
        The committee convenes:
        - Position 1: "I argue FOR because..."
        - Position 2: "I argue AGAINST because..."
        - Position 3: "I see nuance..."
        - Position 4: "Historical context suggests..."
        - Position 5: "But have we considered..."
        
        (All positions speak. All in one call.)
        
    IMPROVISE:
      description: "Run an improv scene"
      parameters:
        - setup: "The scenario"
        - characters: "Who's performing"
      effect: |
        *Shuffle deals role cards*
        
        "The scene is... [setup].
        You are... [roles].
        And... GO!"
        
        (Characters improvise. Speed of light.)
        
  lore: |
    The Ensemble Stage was built by a director
    who hated waiting.
    
    "In film," she said, "we shoot scenes out of order.
    In traditional AI systems, we wait for each response.
    Why can't we have all actors present at once?"
    
    The Speed of Light Suite answered her question.
    The context window became her stage.
    All actors, present. All dialogue, simultaneous.
    
  insight: |
    Traditional multi-agent:
    - Agent A speaks → wait → Agent B speaks → wait → ...
    - N agents × M turns = N×M API calls
    
    Speed of light ensemble:
    - All agents in context
    - All turns simulated in narrative
    - 1 API call for entire scene
    
    The stage doesn't wait for actors.
    The actors are always ready.
    
  pie_menu_connection: |
    **Why 8 positions? Because 8 is magic.**
    
    Pie menus use 8 items because:
    - Humans naturally divide circles into 8 sectors
    - 8 compass directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW)
    - Motor memory maps to spatial position
    - Selection time: O(1) — no scanning needed
    
    Adventure games use 8 exits because:
    - Same spatial intuition
    - "Go north" = position 0 (top of pie)
    - Natural mapping to 2D space
    
    The Ensemble Stage uses 8 positions because:
    - 8 distinct viewpoints cover most debates
    - 8 character archetypes span most stories
    - 8 voices can simulate a crowd
    - 8 is enough for complexity, few enough for coherence
    
    Pie menus → Compass roses → Adventure exits → Ensemble positions
    
    All the same insight: 8 is the human number for "all directions."
