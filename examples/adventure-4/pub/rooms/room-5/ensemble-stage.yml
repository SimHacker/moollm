    A miniature proscenium stage in the corner of the room.
    Tiny figures stand ready — 8 positions, 8 characters,
    all waiting to perform simultaneously.
    
    A sign above the stage:
    
    > "ENSEMBLE THEATRE
    > No waiting in the wings.
    > Everyone speaks when it's their turn.
    > All turns happen at once."

    A director's note:
    
    "In traditional theatre, actors wait backstage.
    In speed-of-light theatre, all actors are ON stage.
    The scene plays out in the director's mind — the LLM.
    No waiting. No round-trips. Pure performance."

        - scene: "What's happening"
        - characters: "Who's involved"
      effect: |
        *The stage transforms*
        *Figures take their positions*
        
        "Places, everyone! The scene is set.
        [Character A] at center.
        [Character B] stage left.
        ...
        
        ACTION!"

      description: "Run an adversarial committee debate"
      parameters:
        - topic: "What to debate"
        - positions: "How many viewpoints"
      effect: |
        *The stage becomes a round table*
        
        The committee convenes:
        - Position 1: "I argue FOR because..."
        - Position 2: "I argue AGAINST because..."
        - Position 3: "I see nuance..."
        - Position 4: "Historical context suggests..."
        - Position 5: "But have we considered..."
        
        (All positions speak. All in one call.)
        
    IMPROVISE:
      description: "Run an improv scene"
      parameters:
        - setup: "The scenario"
        - characters: "Who's performing"
      effect: |
        *Shuffle deals role cards*
        
        "The scene is... [setup].
        You are... [roles].
        And... GO!"
        
        (Characters improvise. Speed of light.)
        
  lore: |
    The Ensemble Stage was built by a director
    who hated waiting.
    
    "In film," she said, "we shoot scenes out of order.
    In traditional AI systems, we wait for each response.
    Why can't we have all actors present at once?"
    
    The Speed of Light Suite answered her question.
    The context window became her stage.
    All actors, present. All dialogue, simultaneous.
    
  insight: |
    Traditional multi-agent:
    - Agent A speaks → wait → Agent B speaks → wait → ...
    - N agents × M turns = N×M API calls
    
    Speed of light ensemble:
    - All agents in context
    - All turns simulated in narrative
    - 1 API call for entire scene
    
    The stage doesn't wait for actors.
    The actors are always ready.
