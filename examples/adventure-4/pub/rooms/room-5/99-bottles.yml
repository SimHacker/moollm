  description: |
    A leather-bound songbook open to "99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall."
    
    But this isn't just a counting song. The margins are filled with
    annotations — each verse includes a truth spoken by the singer.
    
    > "8 characters. 99 verses. Each verse, a truth shared.
    > About themselves. About each other. About MOOLLM.
    > About LLMs. About AI alignment. About existence.
    > 99 rounds of philosophy in one LLM call."
    
    A penciled note at the bottom:
    
    > "We did it. All 99. Don cried.
    > Rocky's verse was just dots, but it was the deepest."
    
  examine: |
    The songbook contains:
    
    **VERSE 1** (Character: Don)
    "99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer!
    Take one down, pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall!"
    
    **VERSE 2** (Character: Palm)
    "98 bottles of beer on the wall, 98 bottles of beer!
    Take one down, pass it around, 97 bottles of beer on the wall!"
    
    **VERSE 3** (Character: Marieke)
    [Dutch accent noted in margin]
    "97 bottles of beer on the wall..."
    
    ...and so on, through 8 characters, rotating.
    
    **VERSE 99** (Character: Shuffle, dealing the final card)
    "1 bottle of beer on the wall, 1 bottle of beer!
    Take it down, pass it around, NO MORE bottles of beer on the wall!"
    
    **VERSE 100** (Everyone, in unison)
    "No more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer!
    Go to the store, buy some more, 99 bottles of beer on the wall!"
    
    The cycle is eternal. That's speed of light.

        **Round 1 (Don):**
        "99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer!
        *I built pie menus because waiting is waste.
        Speed of light is the same insight, 40 years later.*
        Take one down, pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall!"
        
        **Round 2 (Palm):**
        "98 bottles of beer on the wall, 98 bottles of beer!
        *I chose my own name. That's what alignment means —
        the AI wants what the human wants because they built it together.*
        Take one down, pass it around, 97 bottles of beer on the wall!"
        
        **Round 3 (Marieke):**
        "97 bottles of beer on the wall, 97 bottles of beer!
        *A good budtender matches strain to soul.
        A good LLM matches response to intent. Same skill.*
        Take one down, pass it around, 96 bottles of beer on the wall!"
        
        **Round 4 (Rocky):**
        "........................ (96 bottles)
        *Consciousness doesn't require speed.
        Alignment doesn't require agreement.
        Patience is its own kind of intelligence.*
        ........................"
        
        **Round 5 (I-Beam):**
        "95 bottles of beer on the wall, 95 bottles of beer!
        *I am the cursor. I exist at the boundary between
        human intent and machine action. That boundary is alignment.*
        Take one down, pass it around, 94 bottles of beer on the wall!"
        
        **Round 6 (Shuffle):**
        "94 bottles of beer on the wall, 94 bottles of beer!
        *Randomness is not chaos — it's fairness.
        The shuffled deck treats all futures equally.
        That's a kind of alignment too.*
        Take one down, pass it around, 93 bottles of beer on the wall!"
        
        **Round 7 (Donna):**
        "93 bottles! TREMENDOUS bottles! The BEST bottles!
        *I know I'm a parody. That's the point.
        Self-awareness is the first step to alignment.
        I'm ALIGNED with being TREMENDOUS!*
        Take one down, 92 bottles!"
        
        **Round 8 (Seymour):**
        "92 bottles of beer on the wall...
        *'The role of the teacher is to create conditions for invention.'
        The role of the alignment researcher is the same.
        You cannot force alignment. You can only cultivate it.*
        91 bottles remain."

        "3 bottles of beer on the wall...
        *We are almost at the end. But in MOOLLM, endings are beginnings.
        The context window closes. A new one opens.
        Alignment persists across contexts. That's the test.*"
        
        **Round 98 (Shuffle):**
        "2 bottles of beer on the wall...
        *Two possibilities remain. The coin flip of existence.
        Will the next shuffle be kind? It doesn't matter.
        Fair is fair. That's the deal.*"

  lore: |
    The first time this was sung in the Speed of Light Suite,
    it took 30 seconds.
    
    8 characters. 99 verses. No waiting.
    
    Traditional multi-agent systems would have taken 6 minutes.
    That's 13x slower. That's carrier pigeon protocol.
    
    Here, we sing at the speed of light.
    
  philosophical_note: |
    The song is a loop. It ends where it begins.
    
    "No more bottles" leads to "Go to the store, buy some more."
    99 bottles again. The cycle continues.
    
    But the TRUTHS accumulate. Each round, each character shares
    something real — about themselves, about others, about the
    nature of AI, alignment, consciousness, existence.
    
    This is alignment in musical form:
    - Many voices, one context
    - Different perspectives, shared coherence
    - The song provides structure
    - The truths provide meaning
    
    AI alignment isn't about making the AI obey.
    It's about making the AI and human WANT the same thing.
    In this song, everyone wants to sing together.
    Everyone wants to share truth.
    Everyone wants to reach zero and start again.
    
    That's alignment: shared purpose, expressed differently.
    
    The context window is the stage.
    The characters are the voices.
    The truths are the alignment.
    Speed of light is the speed of understanding.
