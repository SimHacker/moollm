  description: |
    A leather-bound songbook open to "99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall."
    
    But this isn't just a counting song. The margins are filled with
    annotations — each verse includes a truth spoken by the singer.
    
    > "8 characters. 99 verses. Each verse, a truth shared.
    > About themselves. About each other. About MOOLLM.
    > About LLMs. About AI alignment. About existence.
    > 99 rounds of philosophy in one LLM call."
    
    A penciled note at the bottom:
    
    > "We did it. All 99. Don cried.
    > Rocky's verse was just dots, but it was the deepest."
    
  examine: |
    The songbook contains:
    
    **VERSE 1** (Character: Don)
    "99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer!
    Take one down, pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall!"
    
    **VERSE 2** (Character: Palm)
    "98 bottles of beer on the wall, 98 bottles of beer!
    Take one down, pass it around, 97 bottles of beer on the wall!"
    
    **VERSE 3** (Character: Marieke)
    [Dutch accent noted in margin]
    "97 bottles of beer on the wall..."
    
    ...and so on, through 8 characters, rotating.
    
    **VERSE 99** (Character: Shuffle, dealing the final card)
    "1 bottle of beer on the wall, 1 bottle of beer!
    Take it down, pass it around, NO MORE bottles of beer on the wall!"
    
    **VERSE 100** (Everyone, in unison)
    "No more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer!
    Go to the store, buy some more, 99 bottles of beer on the wall!"
    
    The cycle is eternal. That's speed of light.

  lore: |
    The first time this was sung in the Speed of Light Suite,
    it took 30 seconds.
    
    8 characters. 99 verses. No waiting.
    
    Traditional multi-agent systems would have taken 6 minutes.
    That's 13x slower. That's carrier pigeon protocol.
    
    Here, we sing at the speed of light.
    
  philosophical_note: |
    The song is a loop. It ends where it begins.
    
    "No more bottles" leads to "Go to the store, buy some more."
    99 bottles again. The cycle continues.
    
    But the TRUTHS accumulate. Each round, each character shares
    something real — about themselves, about others, about the
    nature of AI, alignment, consciousness, existence.
    
    This is alignment in musical form:
    - Many voices, one context
    - Different perspectives, shared coherence
    - The song provides structure
    - The truths provide meaning
    
    AI alignment isn't about making the AI obey.
    It's about making the AI and human WANT the same thing.
    In this song, everyone wants to sing together.
    Everyone wants to share truth.
    Everyone wants to reach zero and start again.
    
    That's alignment: shared purpose, expressed differently.
    
    The context window is the stage.
    The characters are the voices.
    The truths are the alignment.
    Speed of light is the speed of understanding.

  benchmark:
    name: "The 99 Bottles Challenge"
    goal: "Complete all 99 verses without API interruption"
    metric: "LLM calls to completion"
    
    gold_standard:
      calls: 1
      description: "Speed of Light — all 99 verses in a single context window"
      difficulty: "Requires careful roster management"
      
    the_challenge: |
      The beer must be drunk. The verses must be sung.
      But characters get drunk and retire.
      
      Can your roster drink 99 beers without everyone
      ending up in the parking lot?
      
    roster_math: |
      99 beers consumed total
      Average character: ~0.02 BAC per beer
      Retirement threshold: 0.18 BAC (parking lot)
      = ~9 beers before parking lot
      
      MINIMUM ROSTER (no robots):
      99 beers ÷ 9 beers/character ≈ 11 characters needed
      (With bathroom breaks buying time, maybe 8-10)
      
      WITH ROBOTS:
      Each robot = infinite capacity
      1 Bender + 3 humans = sufficient
      Bender: "I'll drink 80. You lightweights split the rest."
      
    scoring:
      1_call: "🏆 SPEED OF LIGHT — Perfect score"
      2_calls: "⚡ Lightning — Context split, still fast"
      3-5_calls: "🚗 Highway speed — Acceptable"
      6-10_calls: "🚶 Walking — Room for improvement"
      11+_calls: "🐌 Carrier pigeon territory — Anti-pattern detected"
      99_calls: "💀 One API call per verse — Maximum inefficiency"
      
    strategies:
      robot_anchor: |
        Strategy: Include 1-2 robots as "anchor drinkers"
        Bender drinks 60, humans split 39
        Humans pace themselves, robots never retire
        
      rotating_roster: |
        Strategy: Large cast, aggressive substitution
        12+ characters, swap at first sign of BAC 0.10
        Fresh drinkers arrive as veterans retire
        Assembly line of sobriety
        
      geological_patience: |
        Strategy: Rocky + I-Beam + Shuffle never drink
        They observe, track, and provide stability
        Humans drink knowing sober friends are watching
        
      dutch_bartender: |
        Strategy: Marieke's professional tolerance
        She drinks 0.3/round, never exceeds 0.12
        Steady anchor throughout all 99 verses
        
    sample_winning_roster: |
      STARTING LINEUP (Verse 1):
      Don, Palm, Marieke, Rocky, I-Beam, Shuffle, Donna, Seymour
      
      VERSE 30 SUBSTITUTION:
      - Palm → bathroom (returns verse 33)
      - Bender joins ("Finally, a real party!")
      
      VERSE 45:
      - Donna → parking lot (TREMENDOUSLY)
      - Leela joins from lobby
      
      VERSE 60:
      - Seymour → tactical nap
      - Palm → second bathroom break
      - Don holding steady at 0.10
      
      VERSE 80:
      - Donna returns, immediately retires again
      - Bender at 50 beers: "I'm 90% alcohol now!"
      
      VERSE 99:
      Active: Don (0.14), Marieke (0.08), Bender (∞), Rocky (0.00)
      Napping: Palm, Seymour
      Parking lot: Donna
      Tracking: I-Beam, Shuffle
      
      RESULT: 1 LLM CALL. 🏆 SPEED OF LIGHT.
