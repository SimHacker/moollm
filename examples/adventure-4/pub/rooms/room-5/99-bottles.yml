    A leather-bound songbook open to "99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall."
    
    The margins are filled with annotations:
    
    > "8 characters. 99 verses. Each character takes turns.
    > That's 99 rounds of simulation in one LLM call.
    > No API round-trips. Pure narrative velocity."
    
    A penciled note at the bottom:
    
    > "We did it. All 99. Don cried."
    
  examine: |
    The songbook contains:
    
    **VERSE 1** (Character: Don)
    "99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer!
    Take one down, pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall!"
    
    **VERSE 2** (Character: Palm)
    "98 bottles of beer on the wall, 98 bottles of beer!
    Take one down, pass it around, 97 bottles of beer on the wall!"
    
    **VERSE 3** (Character: Marieke)
    [Dutch accent noted in margin]
    "97 bottles of beer on the wall..."
    
    ...and so on, through 8 characters, rotating.
    
    **VERSE 99** (Character: Shuffle, dealing the final card)
    "1 bottle of beer on the wall, 1 bottle of beer!
    Take it down, pass it around, NO MORE bottles of beer on the wall!"
    
    **VERSE 100** (Everyone, in unison)
    "No more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer!
    Go to the store, buy some more, 99 bottles of beer on the wall!"
    
    The cycle is eternal. That's speed of light.

        Compare:
        
        TRADITIONAL (API per turn):
        - 99 verses × 8 characters = 792 API calls
        - Average latency: 500ms per call
        - Total time: 396 seconds (6.6 minutes)
        
        SPEED OF LIGHT (single context):
        - 1 LLM call
        - All 99 verses in narrative
        - Total time: ~30 seconds
        
        Speedup: 13x faster. No waiting. Pure singing.

        A more intimate version.
        Still many rounds. Still one call.
        Still speed of light.
        
  lore: |
    The first time this was sung in the Speed of Light Suite,
    it took 30 seconds.
    
    8 characters. 99 verses. No waiting.
    
    Traditional multi-agent systems would have taken 6 minutes.
    That's 13x slower. That's carrier pigeon protocol.
    
    Here, we sing at the speed of light.
    
  philosophical_note: |
    The song is a loop. It ends where it begins.
    
    "No more bottles" leads to "Go to the store, buy some more."
    99 bottles again. The cycle continues.
    
    This is the nature of simulation:
    - State changes
    - Actors take turns
    - The wheel keeps spinning
    - But all of it happens in ONE context window
    
    The context window is the stage.
    The characters are the actors.
    The LLM is the director.
    Speed of light is the speed of thought.
