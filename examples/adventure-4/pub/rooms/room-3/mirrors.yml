# Each mirror reflects a different aspect of your cognitive activity
# Based on the 51 commands of cursor-mirror

mirrors:

  # MIRROR 1: THE NAVIGATION MIRROR
  
  navigation_mirror:
    name: "The Map Mirror"
    position: "north wall"
    emoji: "🗺️"
    description: |
      Shows the topology of your work — all workspaces, all conversations,
      as a navigable tree. Zoom in to see where you've been.
      
    reflects:
      - "Where have I worked?"
      - "What conversations exist?"
      - "How do I find that old chat?"
      
    commands:
      list-workspaces: "Show all workspaces with folder paths"
      show-workspace: "Details about a specific workspace"
      list-composers: "All conversations with metadata"
      show-composer: "Details about a conversation"
      tree: "Hierarchical navigation (w1, w1.c2, w1.c2.tools)"
      find: "Search by name pattern"
      which: "Resolve a reference to its source"
      
    example: |
      *You gaze into the Map Mirror.*
      
      The surface ripples and shows:
      
      ```
      w1  moollm/          [42 chats]   ← you are here
      w2  leela-dashboard/ [18 chats]

    position: "east wall, left"
    emoji: "🌊"
    description: |
      Shows the flow of conversation — messages streaming past like
      water. Recent activity surfaces; older messages sink into depth.
      
    reflects:
      - "What did I just say?"
      - "What happened in the last hour?"
      - "Show me the conversation."

    name: "The Deep Mirror"
    position: "east wall, right"
    emoji: "🔬"
    description: |
      Shows patterns in your work — what you search for, how conversations
      evolve, where time is spent. This mirror thinks before it shows.
      
    reflects:
      - "What patterns do I have?"
      - "How did this conversation evolve?"
      - "Where did things go wrong?"

      File reads, writes, shell commands, MCP calls. The gears exposed.
      
    reflects:
      - "What tools did I use?"
      - "What did that tool return?"
