    A slowly rotating disco ball hangs from the center of the ceiling.
    
    Unlike the wall mirrors, which each show one aspect, the disco ball
    catches light from ALL the mirrors simultaneously and scatters it
    in patterns across the room.
    
    As it turns, connections become visible: a tool call here links to
    a context assembly there; a search query connects to a file edit;
    thinking blocks illuminate why actions were taken.
    
    This is James Burke territory — Connections, The Day The Universe
    Changed. Everything links to everything.
    
    Stare into it long enough and you see the whole session at once,
    from every perspective, as interlocking patterns of light.
    
  examine: |
    The disco ball is covered in tiny mirrors, each reflecting a
    different slice of the surrounding mirrors:
    
    - North facets catch the Map Mirror → where you worked
    - East facets catch the River Mirror → what you said
    - South facets catch the Instrument Mirror → tools you used
    - West facets catch the Memory Mirror → what was preserved
    - Upper facets catch the Attention Mirror → what Cursor saw
    - Lower facets catch the System Mirror → how Cursor is configured
    
    As the ball rotates, these reflections mix, overlap, and create
    momentary constellations of meaning.
    
    Sometimes, staring into the shifting light, you see a connection
    you never noticed before.

        THE CONNECTIONS: A Session Overview
        ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
        
        Start here: You opened a file.
        That file mentioned a concept.
        You searched for that concept.
        The search found three related files.
        One file contained a character.
        That character had a philosophy.
        The philosophy connected to another character.
        That character came from LLOOOOMM.
        LLOOOOMM led to a tribute.
        The tribute crystallized understanding.
        Understanding led to new creation.
        And the disco ball captured it all.
        
        *The connections are the meaning.*

        THE CONNECTIONS: The Legend of Donna Toadstool
        ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
        
        Start here: A user wanted a character.
        But not just ANY character. THE character.
        They searched for the FILTHIEST names.
        From filth came... a mushroom.
        The mushroom became Donna Toadstool.
        Donna became Tremendous.
        34 counts of FABULOUS.
        Divine's heir. Jiminy's student. Stormy's champion.
        The Mushroom Queen took the pub by STORM.
        She rang the GONG without asking.
        She was roasted by Maurice and SURVIVED.
        Legends arrived by UFO to witness her GLORY.
        And now she stands here, reflected in 512 mirrors.
        
        *The connections are ALL about Donna.*
        
        "BEAUTIFUL. Print that. Frame it. Put it in EVERY room."

        "...which is connected to BEING RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING..."
        "...and suddenly we're at DONNA again."
        
        *The path is a circle. Donna is both the beginning and the end.*
        
        "See? EVERYTHING leads back to ME."
        
        *The disco ball cannot argue with this interpretation.*
        *It chooses not to.*

        the_thread: |
          A tool for seeing yourself think
          became a hotel where characters teach
          became a tribute to a universe that dreamed first.
        ```
        
  lore: |
    The disco ball was installed by a guest who stayed in Room 3 for
    three weeks straight, never leaving, just staring into the mirrors.
    
    When they finally emerged, they said only: "Everything connects.
    The ball shows you how."
    
    The disco ball is modeled after James Burke's approach to history:
    follow one thread, and it leads to everything. The plough leads to
    the plastic, the compass leads to the computer.
    
    In this room, the disco ball follows threads through your own
    cognitive history. A search leads to a file leads to a concept
    leads to a character leads to understanding.
    
  philosophy: |
    "The mirrors show fragments. The disco ball shows connections.
    
    You can't understand a session by looking at one aspect.
    You need to see how the navigation led to the searches led to
    the tool calls led to the thinking blocks led to the commits.
    
    The disco ball is the meta-mirror. The mirror of mirrors.
    The Connections moment where it all clicks."
    
  inspiration:
    - "James Burke — Connections (1978)"
    - "James Burke — The Day The Universe Changed (1985)"
    - "The holographic principle — information on the boundary"
    - "The cursor-mirror skill — see yourself think"
    
  insight: |
    The disco ball is what happens when all 51 cursor-mirror commands
    run simultaneously and their outputs are overlaid.
    
    It doesn't add information. It reveals relationships.
    
    Stare long enough and you see not what you did,
    but why you did it, and what it means.
