# 🌐 CONTEXT ORRERY
# A mechanical model of the context window — attention made physical

  description: |
    A brass orrery sits on the navigation desk, but instead of
    planets, it models *context*. A central sphere represents
    your current intention. Orbiting around it: file selections,
    code blocks, terminal output, images, rules.
    
    The orbits pulse with relevance — bright when active, dim
    when fading from attention.

    The orrery's components:
    
    CENTER — INTENTION (golden sphere)
      "What you're trying to accomplish"
      Currently: "Understanding the Navigator's Suite"
      
    INNER ORBIT — HIGH RELEVANCE
      [ROOM.yml] — bright
      [thinking-mirror.yml] — bright
      [current conversation] — pulsing
      
    MIDDLE ORBIT — SUPPORTING CONTEXT
      [cursor-mirror README] — moderate
      [previous room visit] — moderate
      [.cursorrules] — steady
      
    OUTER ORBIT — BACKGROUND
      [global settings] — dim
      [old conversations] — very dim
      [files not recently touched] — barely visible

  lore: |
    The orrery was built by a horologist who worked at NASA —
    she was used to modeling complex orbital systems. When she
    retired, she applied the same thinking to attention.
    
    "Context is just gravity," she said. "Relevant things fall
    toward intention. Irrelevant things drift away."
    
  insight: |
    cursor-mirror commands for the orrery:
    - `cursor-mirror context-sources` — what's in orbit
    - `cursor-mirror request-context` — full assembly
    - `cursor-mirror indexing` — what could be added
    
    The LLM's context window is not infinite. The orrery shows
    the choices being made about what to include.
