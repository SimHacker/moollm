room:
  name: "The Navigator's Suite"
  id: room-3
  number: 3
  theme: introspection
  
  tagline: "See yourself think. The mirror shows what's inside."

    Mirrors everywhere. Eight of them, each showing a different aspect
    of your cognitive activity. A disco ball hangs from the ceiling,
    scattering connections across the room as it slowly rotates.
    
    The mirrors map to cursor-mirror's command categories:
    
    ```yaml
    # THE EIGHT MIRRORS
    🗺️ Map Mirror:        Navigation — workspaces, conversations
    🌊 River Mirror:      Streaming — messages, transcripts
    🔬 Deep Mirror:       Analysis — patterns, timelines
    🔧 Instrument Mirror: Tools — calls, results, checkpoints
    👁️ Attention Mirror:  Context — what Cursor saw
    📚 Memory Mirror:     Archive — exports, todos
    📊 System Mirror:     Status — config, models, MCP
    🖼️ Gallery Mirror:    Images — screenshots, photos
    ```
    
    A disco ball hangs from the center, catching light from ALL
    mirrors and revealing James Burke-style connections between them.
    
    Above the bed:

  skill_integration: |
    This room is a physical manifestation of the cursor-mirror skill.
    Each mirror corresponds to a command category:
    
    🗺️ → list-workspaces, show-workspace, list-composers, tree, find, which
    🌊 → tail, stream, transcript, watch
    🔬 → grep, analyze, timeline, stats, models
    🔧 → tools, tool-result, blobs, checkpoints, diff, thinking, mcp
    👁️ → context, context-sources, request-context, searches, indexing
    📚 → export-*, files, todos, index
    📊 → status-*, dbs, tables, keys, sql, info
    🖼️ → images, image-path, image-info, image-gallery
    
    The disco ball synthesizes all 51 commands into unified understanding.
    I-Beam is the guide who interprets what the mirrors show.
