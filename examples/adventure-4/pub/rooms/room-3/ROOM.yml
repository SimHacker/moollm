# Room 3 — The Navigator's Suite (East)
# Theme: Introspection — seeing yourself think

room:
  name: "The Navigator's Suite"
  id: room-3
  number: 3
  theme: introspection
  
  tagline: "See yourself think. The mirror shows what's inside."
  
  description: |
    Mirrors everywhere. Not for vanity — for *inspection*. Each
    mirror shows something different: one shows your recent actions,
    one shows your current goals, one shows what you're thinking.
    
    A navigation desk dominates the room, covered with charts of
    the mind's territory. A mechanical orrery shows the current
    context window orbiting around intention.
    
    Above the bed:
    
    > "The unexamined life is not worth living." — Socrates
    > (But now we have the tools to examine it.)
    
  ideal_guest: |
    Characters who want to understand themselves. Introspectors,
    meditators, those debugging their own cognition.
