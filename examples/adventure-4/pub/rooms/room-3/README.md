**See yourself think. The mirror shows what's inside.**

## 🌅 Overview

Mirrors everywhere. Eight of them, each showing a different aspect of your cognitive activity. A disco ball hangs from the ceiling, scattering connections across the room as it slowly rotates.

This is a room for **introspectors, meditators, and those debugging their own cognition**.

## 🎭 Permanent Resident

**I-Beam** — Blinks helpfully. Very good at pointing at things. Your introspection guide.

## 💡 Philosophy

This room is a physical manifestation of **cursor-mirror** — the skill of watching yourself think.

The disco ball synthesizes all 51 commands into unified understanding. When it spins, James Burke-style connections appear between the mirrors — unexpected links between what you saw, what you searched, and what you found.

I-Beam guides. The mirrors reflect. You understand.
