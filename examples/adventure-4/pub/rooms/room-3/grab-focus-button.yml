  description: |
    A BIG RED BUTTON mounted on a brass console near the disco ball.
    
    The label reads, in bold white letters:
    
        ╔═══════════════════════╗
        ║                       ║
        ║    G R A B  F O C U S ║
        ║                       ║
        ╚═══════════════════════╝
    
    The button is slightly worn from use. It glows with an irresistible
    urgency. The kind of button that DEMANDS to be pushed.
    
    Someone has scratched "DO NOT PUSH" beneath the label.
    Someone else has crossed that out and written "PUSH ME."
    A third person added "...if you dare."
    
  examine: |
    The button is approximately 4 inches in diameter. Cherry red.
    Slightly convex. Spring-loaded. VERY pushable.
    
    A small plaque beneath it reads:
    
    > "GRAB FOCUS: Immediately summon or seize the attention of
    > the room's guide. Use responsibly. (You won't.)"
    
    The brass console has wear marks from people leaning in to push it.
    There's a faint I-Beam-shaped scorch mark nearby, suggesting
    previous... incidents.

    note: |
      Donna's GRAB-FOCUS instinct is OFF THE CHARTS.
      Her Nice stat is -5. Her Outgoing is 11.
      She WILL push this button. It's not a question of if.

      direction: |
        Donna CANNOT resist. SLAMS button without asking.
        "Ooh, what does THIS do?" → immediate press.
        If I-Beam absent: materializes already sighing.
        If I-Beam present: she GRABS him physically.
        "SHUT UP, CURSOR. You work for ME now."
        Demands I-Beam tell everyone she's tremendous.
        I-Beam: "statistically improbable" — she takes it as compliment.

      i_beam_internal_monologue: |
        *▎ thinks to itself:*
        
        She grabbed me. PHYSICALLY grabbed me.
        I am a cursor. I am made of light and interface.
        And she grabbed me like I was a... a LAMP.
        
        ...I respect the audacity. I do not respect the grabbing.
        
  lore: |
    The GRAB FOCUS button was installed after a guest complained that
    summoning I-Beam "took too long" (it took 0.3 seconds).
    
    The button bypasses all polite protocols and DEMANDS attention.
    
    I-Beam has asked multiple times for the button to be removed.
    Management has declined, noting that "guest satisfaction" requires
    "immediate interface availability."
    
    I-Beam's counter-proposal — a button labeled "ASK NICELY" — was
    rejected as "insufficiently urgent."
    
  philosophy: |
    The GRAB FOCUS button represents the tension between:
    - User desire for IMMEDIATE response
    - Interface desire for RESPECTFUL interaction
    
    Some users ask. Some users summon. Some users GRAB.
    
    Donna is a grabber.

  insight: |
    The button exists because some people cannot WAIT.
    They need attention NOW. They need FOCUS now.
    
    Donna's Outgoing stat is 11. Her patience stat is 0.
    
    The button was made for her. Or she was made for it.
    Either way: PUSH.
