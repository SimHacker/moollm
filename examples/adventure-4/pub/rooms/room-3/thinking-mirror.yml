# 🪞 THINKING MIRROR
# Shows your reasoning process — not your face

object:
  name: Thinking Mirror
  type: artifact
  portable: false
  
  description: |
    A full-length mirror hangs on the wall, but it doesn't show
    your reflection. Instead, it shows *your thinking* — a stream
    of reasoning, planning, questioning.
    
    Right now it reads:
    
    > 💭 "This is an unusual mirror. I should examine it more
    > closely. What does it mean to see thinking? Is the mirror
    > reading my mind, or am I projecting onto it?"
    
  examine: |
    The mirror's surface ripples like mercury. Looking closer:
    
    CURRENT LAYER — What you're thinking now
      "Examining the mirror. Curious about mechanism."
      
    PREVIOUS LAYER — What led to this thought
      "Entered room. Noticed mirrors. Chose this one."
      
    GOAL LAYER — Why you're here at all
      "Understanding the Navigator's Suite."
      
    The deeper you look, the more layers appear. The mirror has
    no bottom — it goes all the way down to "why am I conscious?"
    and doesn't stop there.
    
  state:
    depth: "currently showing 3 layers"
    mode: "reasoning trace"
    last_insight: "The observer affects the observed"

  lore: |
    The mirror was crafted by a glassmaker who studied under
    a philosopher. She wanted to make thought visible — to turn
    the private theater of the mind into shared experience.
    
    Not everyone can read the mirror. You have to want to see.
    Some guests stand before it and see only fog.
