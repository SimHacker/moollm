## ✨ Special Features

### 🐢 Room 1: The Logo Turtle Vehicle

The Logo Turtle in Room 1 can be **embarked as a vehicle**:

```
EMBARK → FORWARD pub → DISEMBARK
```

Travel anywhere in the adventure while piloting the turtle. Say `GO HOME` to return to Room 1.

### 🪨 Room 4: Geological Time

Rocky has been watching plants grow for 4.5 billion years. Ring the brass bell for conversation. The Logo Turtle visits often — they're geological-time buddies.

### 🎒 The Attic: Adventurer's Gear

Take what you need, leave what you find. Weird buffs, deprecated features, edge case equipment.
