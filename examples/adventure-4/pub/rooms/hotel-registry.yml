  description: |
    A heavy leather-bound book, spine cracked with use.
    Each page records a stay: guest name, room, dates,
    and occasionally, notes from the staff.
    
    The book smells like old paper and adventure.

    The registry is worn but well-kept.
    Some pages have coffee stains (Room 7 visitors).
    Some have spiral doodles (Room 1 visitors).
    Some have geological dust (Room 4 resident).
    
    It's a living document.
    Just like the hotel.
