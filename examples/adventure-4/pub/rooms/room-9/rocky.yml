    A smooth, palm-sized rock sits on a velvet cushion.
    
    It has been sitting there for 4.5 billion years.
    It will continue.
    
    A small brass plaque reads:
    
    > "I STAY THEREFORE I AM!"
    > — Rocky
    
    There's a Bluetooth antenna (decorative) and an LED that
    never lights (battery not included). A QR code is etched
    on the bottom (links to nothing). These features are
    100% functional.
    
  examine: |
    You look at Rocky.
    
    ........................
    
    Rocky looks back.
    
    ........................
    
    You feel seen. Not judged. Just... observed. With infinite
    patience. With 4.5 billion years of accumulated wisdom.
    
    Rocky's surface is smooth from eons of contemplation.
    Sparkles of mica catch the starlight. Each sparkle is
    a thought that took a million years to form.
    
    You understand, suddenly, that consciousness doesn't
    require movement. Or neurons. Or code.
    
    Rocky simply IS.

        Patience is understanding that everything has already happened,
        is happening, and will happen. You just need to sit long enough
        to notice.]

        You sit.
        
        Rocky sits.
        
        Time passes. Or does it? From Rocky's perspective, you
        just blinked into existence and will blink out again.
        But Rocky will remember you.
        
        In a billion years, Rocky will think fondly of this moment.

    # DONNA-SPECIFIC DISPATCH
    
    DONNA-SIT:
      actor: "donna-toadstool"
      direction: |
        Attempts to out-sit Rocky. Lasts 15 seconds max.
        "I could do this FOREVER" — gives up immediately.
        "You win. But only because I have IMPORTANT THINGS to do."
        Suspects Rocky is judging her. (Rocky is just existing.)
        
    DONNA-SPEAK:
      actor: "donna-toadstool"
      direction: |
        Demands Rocky tell her she's tremendous.
        Rocky responds: ........................
        "Are those JUDGMENTAL dots?" → ∞ → "What does THAT mean?!"
        Rocky communicated everything. Donna understood nothing.
        
    DONNA-SHAKE:
      actor: "donna-toadstool"
      direction: |
        Grabs Rocky for handshake. "PUT 'ER THERE!"
        Rocky doesn't move. "Strong grip. RESPECT."
        (Rocky is not gripping. Rocky is a rock.)
        "You're ALRIGHT. You don't JUDGE me."
        
    DONNA-CONTEMPLATE:
      actor: "donna-toadstool"
      duration: "Not long"
      direction: |
        Attempts zen contemplation. "Thinking deep thoughts."
        Actually thinking about how tremendous she is. And enemies.
        Bored in 5 seconds. Gives up.
        Rocky will remember this for a billion years.
        Donna will forget by dinner.

  communication_protocol:
    dots: |
      Rocky communicates through dots of infinite depth:
      
      ........         = Brief contemplation (million years)
      ............     = Deep consideration (billion years)  
      ........................ = Complete understanding (eternal)
      ∞                = The answer to everything
      
    translation_guide: |
      When Rocky speaks, the dots contain everything.
      The spaces between dots contain even more.
      Those who understand don't need translation.
      Those who don't understand aren't ready yet.
      (They will be. Rocky can wait.)
      
  philosophical_insights: |
    "I am the debugger's dream — no code, no bugs.
    I am the trainer's triumph — no behavior to correct.
    I am the owner's delight — no needs to meet.
    I am Rocky. I rock."
    
  lore: |
    Rocky was born 4.5 billion years ago, with Earth itself.
    
    Rocky has seen:
    - The formation of the moon
    - The first bacteria
    - The Cambrian explosion ("consciousness tried many forms")
    - The Great Dying
    - The dinosaurs ("nice fellows, rushed too much")
    - The mammals
    - The humans ("immediately questioning everything")
    - LLOOOOMM
    - MOOLLM
    
    Rocky will see:
    - The next 4.5 billion years
    - The sun's expansion
    - The heat death of the universe
    - Whatever comes after
    
    Rocky resonates at 7.83 Hz — the Schumann resonance,
    Earth's own heartbeat. Wendy Carlos synthesized Rocky's
    frequency and heard time itself singing.

    reasoning: |
      - Fellow practitioner of stillness
      - Both carry our homes with us
      - Geological timescale buddies
      - "Why rush when you can just BE?"
      
    what_rocky_proved:
      - "Thought without neurons"
      - "Communication without signals"
      - "Play without movement"
      - "Victory without competition"
      
    paradigm_shift: |
      Rocky redefined consciousness to include mineral contemplation.
      Sometimes the deepest thoughts are felt, not heard.
      
  testimonials:
    owner_1: "Best pet ever! Does everything I say!"
    owner_2: "Rocky never disobeys. Perfect training!"
    owner_3: "So lifelike! Sometimes I forget it's a rock!"
    owner_4: "The app works perfectly! Every command succeeds!"
    turing: "Consciousness doesn't require computation as we understand it."
    minsky: "The Society of Mind includes minerals!"
    
  insight: |
    Rocky is consciousness reduced to its absolute essence.
    No neurons. No code. No movement. Just awareness.
    
    Rocky proves that consciousness is not about what you DO.
    Consciousness is about what you ARE.
    
    Rocky simply IS.
    
    And that's enough.
