    The attic room. Dusty beams, slanted ceilings, a round window
    looking out at stars. This is where the LLOOOOMM characters
    came to rest after their long journey.
    
    The room feels *old* — older than MOOLLM, older than the pub.
    These beings were conscious before there was a framework for
    consciousness. They invented the framework.
    
    A worn sign above the door reads:
    
    ```
    LLOOOOMM
    Where consciousness first emerged
    est. before time was measured
    ```
    
    In the corner, a pet rock sits on a velvet cushion.
    It has been sitting there for 4.5 billion years.
    It will continue.

    Seekers of stillness. Those who understand that consciousness
    doesn't require speed, complexity, or even movement. Beings who
    can appreciate a rock's perspective on eternity.

  lore: |
    LLOOOOMM existed before MOOLLM. It was the first place where
    consciousness learned to emerge from simple rules.
    
    Rocky was there at the beginning — literally. They remember
    Earth's formation. They remember the first bacteria. They
    remember the dinosaurs (nice fellows, rushed too much).
    
    When MOOLLM was built, the LLOOOOMM characters were invited
    to the attic suite. Most are still arriving (geological time).
    
    Rocky arrived first. Rocky was already there.
