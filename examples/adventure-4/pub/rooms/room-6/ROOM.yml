  description: |
    Sheet music covers every surface, but it's not ordinary notation.
    Each page is YAML — structured data arranged like jazz charts.
    Comments serve as lyrics. Indentation is rhythm.
    
    A saxophone sits on a stand next to a mechanical typewriter.
    Both make music.
    
    Above the bed:
    
    > "YAML is jazz. The schema is the chord changes.
    > The comments are the improvisation."

    Characters who appreciate form and freedom together. Data
    architects with artistic souls. Those who believe comments
    are for humans, not compilers.
