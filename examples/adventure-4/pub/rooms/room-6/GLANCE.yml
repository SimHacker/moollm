number: 6
theme: yaml-jazz
tagline: Structure with soul. Comments that mean something.

description: Sheet music everywhere — YAML structured like jazz charts. Comments as lyrics. Indentation is rhythm.

instruments:
  saxophone: On stand, makes music
  typewriter: Mechanical, also makes music

quote: |
  "YAML is jazz. The schema is the chord changes.
  The comments are the improvisation."

objects:
  - jazz-typewriter.yml (types YAML as music)
  - comment-saxophone.yml (plays meaning, not just notes)

ideal_guest: Data architects with artistic souls. Those who believe comments are for humans.
