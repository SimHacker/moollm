# The instrument that plays meaning, not just notes

  name: Comment Saxophone
  type: artifact
  portable: true
  
  description: |
    A brass saxophone with unusual keys. Instead of notes, each key
    produces a different type of comment. The bell is engraved:
    
    "COMMENTS ARE FOR HUMANS, NOT COMPILERS"

    The keys are labeled with comment types:

      response: |
        *plays [WHY] key*
        
        A WHY comment explains reasoning, not mechanics.
        Not "increments counter" but "prevents infinite loop".

  methods:
    PLAY:
      description: "Add a comment to code or YAML"
      parameters:
        - code: "The code to comment"
        - type: "WHY, WHAT, WARN, TODO, HACK, NOTE, SEE, or MAGIC"
      effect: |
        *saxophone plays the appropriate phrase*
        
        The comment appears, but it's not ordinary documentation.
        It carries meaning. It tells the reader what matters.
        It sounds like: ♫ "Here's why this exists..." ♫
        
    SOLO:
      description: "Improvise a comment based on context"
      parameters:
        - context: "What the code is doing"
      effect: |
        *takes a deep breath*
        *plays an extended improvisational phrase*
        
        The saxophone analyzes the code, understands its purpose,
        and produces a comment that captures the essence.
        
        Often the comment is better than the code.
        
    DUET:
      description: "Play with the Jazz Typewriter"
      parameters:
        - yaml: "The YAML being typed"
      effect: |
        The saxophone and typewriter play together.
        Structure (typewriter) and meaning (saxophone) interweave.
        The result is YAML Jazz at its finest.
        
  lore: |
    The saxophone was forged from melted-down compiler error messages.
    It can only play truths. Lies produce squeaks.
    
    A master saxophonist can add a single comment that makes
    an entire codebase suddenly comprehensible.
    
    The bell inscription has a second line, visible only at night:
    "THE BEST CODE NEEDS NO COMMENTS. THE BEST COMMENTS NEED NO CODE."
    
  philosophical_note: |
    Comments exist in a liminal space:
    - They're in the source but not in the binary
    - They're written for humans but read by few
    - They're prose in a world of syntax
    
    The saxophone makes this visible. Audible. 
    It says: "This matters too."
