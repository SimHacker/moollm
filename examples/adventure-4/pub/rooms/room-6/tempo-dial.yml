        The dial moves to [tempo].
        All subsequent YAML output follows this rhythm.
        
    RENDER:

      parameters:
        - data: "Data to render"
      returns: |
        The data, formatted at the current tempo.
        
        STACCATO: just the key values
        LEGATO: every nested detail
        
    COMPARE:
      description: "Show same data at all tempos"
      parameters:
        - data: "Data to compare"
      returns: |
        Five renderings, one per tempo.
        
        Shows how the same information can be expressed
        from minimal to maximal, all valid, all useful.
        
  lore: |
    The dial was invented by a conductor who also programmed.
    
    "Music has dynamics," she said. "Why shouldn't data?"
    
    She noticed that the same information served different needs:
    - The machine wanted terse
    - The debugger wanted verbose
    - The human wanted readable
    
    So she built a dial that could produce all three.
    
  philosophical_note: |
    There is no "correct" level of detail.
    
    STACCATO is not "too little."
    LEGATO is not "too much."
    
    They're different rhythms for different contexts.
    
    The dial reminds us: the same data, expressed differently,
    serves different purposes. YAML Jazz is about choosing
    the right tempo for the right moment.
