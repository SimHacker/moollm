    The scroll unrolls to reveal block text — prose that lives
    inside YAML, formatted as the author intended.
    
    A note attached: "The pipe character | is a door to freedom."

        Ah, you need the scroll.
        
        For prose that breathes,
        for lore that flows,
        for descriptions that describe —
        
        The pipe character is your friend.

  methods:
    INSCRIBE:
      description: "Write multiline content to the scroll"
      parameters:
        - content: "The text to inscribe"
        - mode: "| or > (default: |)"
      effect: |
        The scroll unfurls.
        You write your text, line by line.
        The scroll preserves every newline, every space.
        
        When you're done, the scroll shows the YAML:
        
        your_field: |
          Your text here
          Exactly as you wrote it
          Including blank lines
          
          Like this one.
          
    FOLD:
      description: "Convert block to folded format"
      parameters:
        - content: "Block text with newlines"
      returns: |
        The same content, but ready for > format.
        Newlines become spaces. Paragraphs stay paragraphs.
        
        Good for: documentation that will reflow
        Bad for: code, ASCII art, poetry
        
    UNFOLD:
      description: "Convert folded to block format"
      parameters:
        - content: "Folded text"
      returns: |
        The content with intentional line breaks.
        
        You decide where lines break.
        The reader sees what you saw.
        
    COMPARE:
      description: "Show same content in | and > format"
      parameters:
        - content: "Text to compare"
      returns: |
        Side by side comparison:
        
        │ |  (literal)           │ >  (folded)            │
        ├────────────────────────┼────────────────────────┤
        │ Line one.              │ Line one. Line two.    │
        │ Line two.              │                        │
        │                        │ New paragraph.         │
        │ New paragraph.         │                        │
        
  lore: |
    The scroll was written by a scribe who was tired of
    escaping newlines with \n.
    
    "I want to write prose," she said, "not escape sequences."
    
    She invented the block scalar, and prose lived in YAML forever.
    
    The scroll is her original draft. It still works.
    
  philosophical_note: |
    Block scalars are where YAML stops being "just data"
    and becomes a home for human expression.
    
    In a block scalar, you can write:
    - Poems
    - Stories
    - Documentation
    - Code examples
    - ASCII art
    - Philosophical musings (like this one)
    
    The structure holds the prose.
    The prose fills the structure.
    This is YAML Jazz at its best.
    
  incantation: |
    When in doubt, use the pipe.
    When prose must flow, use the fold.
    When trailing newlines matter, use the modifier.
    When nothing works, read the spec.
