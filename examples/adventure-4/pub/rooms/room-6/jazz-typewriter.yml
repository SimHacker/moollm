  description: |
    An antique typewriter that plays music as you type. Each key
    has two functions: it types a character AND sounds a note.
    Colons are bass notes. Indentation is rhythm.
    
    A sign reads: "YAML IS MUSIC. PLAY IT."
    
  examine: |
    The keyboard is mapped to musical notes:
    
    STRUCTURE KEYS (bass register):
      ':' — Deep thump (colon, the separator)
      '-' — Snare hit (list item)
      '  ' — Rest (indentation)
      
    VALUE KEYS (melody register):
      a-z — Chromatic scale
      0-9 — Percussion fills
      
    COMMENT KEY:
      '#' — Saxophone riff (comments are the jazz)
      
    Sample output (typed, then heard):
    
    ```yaml
    # SESSION SUMMARY    ♪♫ (saxophone intro)
    session:             ♩ (bass)
      id: 9861c0a4       ♪♪ (melody)
      files_written:     ♩
        - cursor_mirror.py  # <═══ main work  ♪♫
    ```
    
  state:
    current_composition: "boot-sequence.yml"
    key_signature: "YAML major"

      effect: |
        The typewriter types and plays simultaneously.
        Structure becomes rhythm. Data becomes melody.
        Comments become jazz improvisation.

      parameters:
        - yaml: "The YAML to enhance"
      returns: |
        The same structure with:
        - Section headers as comments
        - <═══ arrows for important values
        - Elision notes for boring parts

      returns: "YAML structure that encodes the melody"
      
  lore: |
    The typewriter was built by a programmer who was also a
    jazz pianist. She was tired of data being "dead" — just
    structure without feeling.
    
    "Every YAML file tells a story," she said. "The comments
    are where you tell the listener what matters."
    
  insight: |
    YAML Jazz style:
    - Elide the boring (`# 23 files read — not listing`)
    - Highlight the important (`<═══ look here!`)
    - Comment with context (`# You asked about this`)
    - Truncate the obvious (`id: 9861c0a4  # prefix only`)
    
    I-Beam speaks YAML Jazz fluently.
