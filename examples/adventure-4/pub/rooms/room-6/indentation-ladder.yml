# 🪜 INDENTATION LADDER
# Climb the hierarchy — each rung a level of nesting

  name: Indentation Ladder
  type: artifact
  portable: true
  
  description: |
    A peculiar ladder where each rung is exactly two spaces higher
    than the last. Labels on the rungs read:
    
    RUNG 0: root
    RUNG 1: object
    RUNG 2: property
    RUNG 3: nested
    RUNG 4: deeply_nested
    RUNG 5: "You probably don't need to go this deep"
    RUNG 6: "Seriously, refactor"
    RUNG 7: "I warned you"

        If you're past rung 4, ask yourself:
        - Could this be a separate file?
        - Could this use references?
        - Did I lose my way?

  methods:
    CLIMB:
      description: "Go deeper into the structure"
      parameters:
        - levels: "How many rungs to climb"
      effect: |
        You climb [levels] rungs on the ladder.
        The view changes — you see more detail, less context.
        
        At rung 0: you see the whole document
        At rung 4: you see one deeply nested value
        At rung 7: you see only callback hell
        
    DESCEND:
      description: "Return toward root"
      parameters:
        - levels: "How many rungs to descend"
      effect: |
        You descend [levels] rungs.
        Detail fades. Context returns.
        
        "Ah, NOW I see where this fits."
        
    SURVEY:

      parameters:
        - yaml: "The YAML to analyze"
      returns: |
        Indentation profile:
        
        rung 0: ████████████ 12 lines (root)
        rung 1: ████████ 8 lines
        rung 2: ██████ 6 lines
        rung 3: ██ 2 lines
        rung 4+: 0 lines ✓ (healthy!)
        
        Verdict: Well-structured. Readable from any rung.
        
    FLATTEN:
      description: "Suggest refactors to reduce nesting"
      parameters:
        - yaml: "Deeply nested YAML"
      returns: |
        Suggestions to reduce depth:
        
        - Extract `config.options.defaults` to `defaults.yml`
        - Use anchor/alias for repeated structures
        - Consider: is this complexity necessary?
        
  lore: |
    The ladder was built by a programmer who got lost in their own
    configuration file. They were found three days later at rung 9,
    muttering about "just one more nested object."
    
    They built the ladder to help others find their way back.
    
    The rungs above 7 are intentionally rickety.
    
  philosophical_note: |
    Indentation is not just formatting. It's meaning.
    
    Each level of nesting says:
    "This belongs to that. This is part of that. This is inside that."
    
    Too shallow: everything's a sibling, no relationships
    Too deep: everything's tangled, no overview
    
    The sweet spot is usually 2-4 levels.
    Like a good outline. Like a good conversation.
    
  aphorisms:
    - "Flat is better than nested. — The Zen of Python"
    - "If you can't see the root, you've climbed too high."
    - "Every rung you climb, you lose one friend."
