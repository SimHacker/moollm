# 🎷 Room 6 — The YAML Jazz Suite

> *"YAML is jazz. The schema is the chord changes.*
> *The comments are the improvisation.*
> *The | is the breath between phrases."*

**Structure with soul. Comments that mean something.**

## 🌅 Overview

Sheet music covers every surface, but it's not ordinary notation. Each page is YAML — structured data arranged like jazz charts. Comments serve as lyrics. Indentation is rhythm.

A saxophone sits on a stand next to a mechanical typewriter. Both make music.

This is a room for **data architects with artistic souls** — those who believe comments are for humans, not compilers.

## 🎭 Permanent Resident

**The Jazz Typewriter** — Clicks and clacks in structured rhythms. Types YAML as music.

## 👻 Summonable Spirits

| Spirit | Invocation | Topic |
|--------|------------|-------|
| **Clark Innes** | Type on the Jazz Typewriter | YAML philosophy, data as poetry, structure with soul |
| **The YAML Muse** | Play the Comment Saxophone | Inspiration for beautiful documentation |
| **Schema Ghost** | Tick the Metronome 3x | Validation, standards, when to break the rules |

*The saxophone plays WHY, not WHAT. The schema keeps it honest.*

## 💡 Philosophy

YAML Jazz is the MOOLLM aesthetic:

| Element | Jazz | YAML |
|---------|------|------|
| Structure | Chord changes | Schema |
| Freedom | Improvisation | Comments |
| Rhythm | Time signature | Indentation |
| Soul | Feeling | Semantic meaning |

The Comment Saxophone plays WHY, not WHAT. The Schema Metronome keeps everything valid. The Elision Eraser removes the boring parts.

## 🎵 The K-Line Jukebox

Drop in a coin. Select a K-line. Watch the associations play like songs:

- SOCIETY-OF-MIND → agents, emergence, Minsky
- CONSTRUCTIONISM → learning, building, Papert
- YAML-JAZZ → comments, structure, soul

Each K-line is a playlist of connected memories.
