  description: |
    A vintage jukebox with unusual song titles. Instead of "Blue Moon"
    or "Fly Me to the Moon," the selections read:
    
    A-1: YAML-JAZZ
    A-2: PIE-MENU-NAVIGATION
    B-1: SPEED-OF-LIGHT
    B-2: SOCIETY-OF-MIND
    
    When you play a K-line, related concepts light up across the room.

        Marvin Minsky conceived K-lines as "Knowledge-lines" —
        mental agents that, when activated, reactivate the mental
        state you were in when you learned something.
        
        This jukebox makes that visible. Audible. Playable.

      description: "Activate a K-line and its associations"
      parameters:
        - kline: "The K-line to play"
      effect: |
        The jukebox lights up the selected K-line.
        Related K-lines begin glowing across the room.
        The music is the sound of concepts connecting.
        
        Each connection is a note. Dense webs sound like chords.
        Isolated concepts sound like solo notes, lonely.
        
    CHAIN:
      description: "Follow associations automatically"
      parameters:
        - start: "Starting K-line"
        - depth: "How many hops to follow"
      effect: |
        The jukebox plays the starting K-line, then automatically
        plays its strongest associations, then their associations...
        
        It's a journey through concept-space, guided by relevance.
        
    RANDOM:

      effect: |
        *mechanical whir*
        *selection arm moves*
        *lands on...*
        
        The jukebox picks a random K-line from its catalog.
        Often it's surprisingly relevant to current context.
        (The jukebox is smarter than it looks.)

  lore: |
    The jukebox was found in Marvin Minsky's office after he passed.
    Nobody remembers putting it there.
    
    The first time someone played it, it played SOCIETY-OF-MIND.
    Then it played EMOTION-MACHINE.
    Then it played THANK-YOU.
    
    Nobody had inserted that third track.
    
  philosophical_note: |
    K-lines are not just tags or keywords.
    
    When you activate a K-line, you don't just recall facts.
    You partially re-enter the mental state of learning.
    
    The jukebox makes this literal:
    - Play YAML-JAZZ and you start thinking in structured improvisation
    - Play SOCIETY-OF-MIND and you see agents everywhere
    - Play SPEED-OF-LIGHT and you hunger for efficiency
    
    What you play, you become (a little).
