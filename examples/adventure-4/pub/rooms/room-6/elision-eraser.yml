  methods:
    ELIDE:
      description: "Replace repetitive content with summary"
      parameters:
        - content: "The verbose content"
        - face: "Which elision style to use"
      returns: |
        The content, but with boring parts replaced by elegant summaries.
        
        Example:
          Before: [47 lines of similar log entries]
          After:  # ... 47 log entries (all INFO level) ...
          
    RESTORE:
      description: "Expand an elision back to full content"
      parameters:
        - elision: "The '...' marker"
      effect: |
        The eraser works in reverse!
        It can restore what was elided, if asked.
        
        But it asks first: "Are you sure? It was elided for a reason."
        
    DETECT:
      description: "Find elidable patterns in content"
      parameters:
        - content: "Content to analyze"
      returns: |
        A report of what could be elided:
        - Repetitive sections (COUNT)
        - Boilerplate (CATEGORY)
        - References (POINTER)
        - Time passages (TEMPORAL)
        
  lore: |
    The eraser was created by an editor who died of boredom
    while reviewing verbose documentation.
    
    Her last words: "Just tell me what's different."
    
    The eraser is her legacy. It honors the reader's time.
    
  philosophical_note: |
    Elision is not deletion. Deletion removes information.
    Elision *acknowledges* information while declining to repeat it.
    
    "..." says: "There's more here, but you don't need it now."
    
    This is respect. This is trust. This is YAML Jazz.
