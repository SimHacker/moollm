  In the style of Cassius Marcellus Coolidge's famous 'Dogs Playing Poker' paintings. Classic oil painting aesthetic, warm amber lamp lighting, dramatic composition.
  
  THE SCENE: Eight puppies gathered around a smooth granite boulder (Rocky) being used as the card table. Green felt cloth draped over Rocky's top surface. Playing cards, poker chips, cigars, drinks scattered on the boulder-table.
  
  THE PLAYERS (each breed recognizable, each personality distinct):
  
  PEPPER (tiny 8-lb Chihuahua mix, cinnamon-red, ENORMOUS bat ears):
  - SITTING ON TOP OF GOLIATH'S MASSIVE HEAD like a tiny queen on a throne
  - Holding her cards with tiny paws, FIERCE expression, trembling with intensity
  - Has the BEST poker face — looks like she's winning
  - Attitude says: 'I may be small but I will DESTROY you at this game'
  
  GOLIATH (140-lb Great Dane, blue-grey, ENORMOUS):
  - Sitting at one end of the table, biggest presence
  - Pepper is literally perched on his giant head, he looks UP at her adoringly, confused but happy
  - Holding cards in massive paws, gentle eyes, clearly has no idea what he's doing
  - Expression: apologetic for taking up so much space
  
  MOCHI (35-lb Shiba/Lab mix, cream-gold, curly tail):
  - Sitting slightly apart from others, judging everyone
  - Perfect eyeliner markings, immaculate
  - Looking at her cards with supreme disdain
  - NOT touching anyone. Evaluating. The cat at a dog game.
  
  DASH (45-lb Border Collie/Lab mix, black with white blaze, heterochromia - one brown one amber eye):
  - Clearly COUNTING CARDS, intense mathematical stare
  - Head tilted at 45 degrees, analyzing the odds
  - Has probably memorized every card played
  - Trying to organize everyone's betting strategy
  
  ZIGGY (45-lb Dalmatian/Lab mix, cream-gold with black spots):
  - Cannot sit still even while playing cards
  - Spotted ears bouncing, tail wagging IN RHYTHM
  - One spot over eye like a beauty mark
  - Probably tapping his feet under the table
  
  BRUNO (55-lb Boxer/Lab mix, brindle tiger stripes, stocky):
  - SIGNATURE UNDERBITE GRIN with tongue slightly out
  - Clearly about to do something chaotic — passing cards under the table?
  - The troublemaker, the bluffer, the one who makes the game FUN
  - Muscular, wiggly, cannot contain his joy
  
  MAPLE (55-lb German Shepherd/Lab mix, golden-maple with black saddle):
  - One ear up, one ear flopping — her signature look
  - Taking the game VERY SERIOUSLY, guarding her cards like military secrets
  - Alert eyes scanning for cheaters (looking at Bruno)
  - Expression: 'This is a SERIOUS competition'
  
  TEDDY (75-lb Bernese/Lab mix, golden with black saddle, white chest heart):
  - Biggest fluffball, old soul eyes
  - Holding cards loosely, not really trying to win
  - Just happy to be included, will comfort whoever loses
  - Leaning slightly toward his siblings, emotional support
  
  COMPOSITION:
  - Rocky (the boulder) as central table, green felt on top
  - Warm amber/golden lamp lighting from above
  - Cards, chips, maybe a whiskey glass or two
  - Cigar smoke wisping through the air
  - Classic poker game tension mixed with puppy chaos
  
  SPECIAL INTERACTION:
  - Pepper and Goliath are the OPPOSITES — smallest and biggest
  - Pepper sitting ON Goliath's head, he's looking up at her
  - Both adopted — the 'chosen ones' — bonded through being different
  - She's fierce, he's gentle. She's 8 lbs, he's 140 lbs. She's in charge.
  
  STYLE: Classic oil painting, Coolidge's Dogs Playing Poker aesthetic. Rich warm colors, dramatic lighting, anthropomorphic dogs with human expressions. Painterly brushstrokes visible. Museum-quality fine art.
