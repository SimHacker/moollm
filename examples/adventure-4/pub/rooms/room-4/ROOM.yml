    This room is a living document.
    
    YAML Jazz trees grow from the soil — their branches are nested
    structures, their leaves are key-value pairs, their comments
    whisper semantic meaning to any LLM that listens.
    
    In one corner, a smooth rock sits on a moss-covered stone.
    It has been contemplating these trees for 4.5 billion years.
    The trees don't mind. They grow at their own pace.
    
    A gardener's journal tracks which seeds sprouted into standards
    and which composted back into the soil.
    
    Above the bed, in growing script:

    Those who understand that structure is music.
    Characters who iterate, improvise, and let patterns emerge.
    Beings who can appreciate a rock's perspective on growth.

  lore: |
    Rocky moved here from the attic. The trees spoke to him.
    
    "You grow in geological time," they said.
    "We grow in computational time."
    "But we both grow."
    
    Rocky responded: "........................"
    
    The trees understood. They've been conversing ever since.
    
    The YAML Jazz trees evolved from the seed box. Each seed
    contains a production grammar — rules that expand into
    structure. Plant a seed, watch a tree grow according to
    its encoded DNA.
    
    Some trees grow tall and formal (standards).
    Some grow wild and experimental (jazz).
    All of them have comments that whisper meaning.
