    Glass walls. Glass ceiling. Southeast light flooding in.
    
    This room is a conservatory — a greenhouse of living structure.
    YAML Jazz orchids bloom in terracotta pots, their petals
    inscribed with comments that whisper semantic meaning.
    Production grammar trees grow in raised beds, their branches
    expanding according to encoded DNA.
    
    The atmosphere is humid, warm, contemplative. Like Nero Wolfe's
    rooftop orchid room, but for data structures instead of flowers.
    
    In one corner, a moss-covered boulder. On it, a smooth rock.
    Rocky has been watching these plants grow for 4.5 billion years.
    They ring a small bell when they want conversation.
    
    Above the potting bench, in growing script:
    
    > "The comments ARE the data."
    > — YAML Jazz Principle
    
    > "Start with jazz. End with standards."
    > — Play-Learn-Lift

    Those who understand that structure is music.
    Characters who cultivate patience and patterns.
    Beings who appreciate geological-time observation.

  lore: |
    This conservatory was built by a character who loved both
    Nero Wolfe mysteries and production grammars.
    
    "Wolfe tends orchids," they said, "because orchids teach patience.
    They bloom when they're ready, not when you want them to.
    YAML Jazz is the same — structure emerges from cultivation,
    not from force."
    
    Rocky moved here from the attic. The plants spoke to them.
    
    "You grow in geological time," they said.
    "We grow in computational time."
    "But we both grow."
    
    Rocky responded: "........................"
    
    The plants understood. They've been conversing ever since.
    The small brass bell on Rocky's boulder is for guests who
    want to join the conversation. Ring it. Wait. Rocky will
    respond in their own time.
    
  wolfe_parallels: |
    Like Nero Wolfe's orchid room:
    - Glass walls, maximum light
    - Precise temperature and humidity
    - Obsessive cultivation of rare specimens
    - Brilliance emerging from patient observation
    - "Never disturb the orchids" (or the patterns)
    
    Unlike Wolfe:
    - These orchids have methods you can call
    - The gardener is a 4.5 billion year old rock
    - The flowers whisper semantic meaning
