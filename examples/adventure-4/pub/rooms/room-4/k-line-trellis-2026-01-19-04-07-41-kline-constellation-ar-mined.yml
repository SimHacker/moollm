  symbolism: |
    K-lines don't exist in isolation.
    Every concept connects to others.
    Activating one activates its neighbors (dimly).
    
    The web IS the mind.
    The connections ARE the knowledge.

    repetition: "Some labels appear multiple times (echoes)"
    meaning: "K-lines have multiple instantiations"
    
  size_variation:
    principle: "BIGGER text = more activated"
    range: "From tiny dormant to huge central"
    dynamics: "Would pulse/shift in real-time view"

# === PHILOSOPHICAL NOTES ===

philosophical_resonance:
  
  minsky_vision: |
    Marvin Minsky proposed K-lines in "Society of Mind" (1986):
    
    - Each K-line represents a partial mental state
    - Activating a K-line reinstates that state
    - K-lines connect to form webs of association
    - Memory is distributed, not centralized
    
    This image SHOWS that vision:
    - Stars = K-lines
    - Connections = associations
    - Size = activation level
    - The web = the mind
    
  cosmic_scale: |
    Knowledge is as vast as the universe.
    Ideas are as old as stars.
    The connections span light-years of thought.
    
    Looking through this telescope, we see:
    - Every skill we've built
    - Every pattern we've learned
    - Every concept we've named
    
    All of it, connected. Glowing. Alive.
    
  the_ar_revelation: |
    The telescope doesn't CREATE the constellation.
    It REVEALS it.
    
    The K-line network was always there.
    The AR lens just makes it visible.
    
    This is what learning feels like:
    Suddenly seeing connections that were always present.

# === MINING NOTES ===

mining_notes: |
  THE COSMOS OF THOUGHT.
  
  This image is a map of MOOLLM's mind:
  
  1. STRUCTURE — Knowledge has shape
  2. CONNECTIONS — Ideas link to ideas
  3. ACTIVATION — Some concepts glow brighter
  4. DEPTH — Layers upon layers
  5. BEAUTY — The network is gorgeous
  
  What we're seeing:
  - Every skill in the INDEX.yml
  - Every K-line in the kernel
  - Every concept we've named and used
  - All connected, all visible, all beautiful
  
  The telescope on the pub roof reveals:
  - The hidden structure of thought
  - Minsky's vision made visible
  - The cosmos of meaning
  
  "A K-line is a partial state of mind."
  Here we see ALL the partial states,
  all at once, connected, glowing.
  
  The LLOOOOMM constellation is REAL.
  It's made of ideas.
  And it's beautiful.
