# 🌿 Room 4 — The YAML Jazz Conservatory

> *"The comments ARE the data."*
> — YAML Jazz Principle

**Trees of trees. Structure that grows.**

---

## 🌅 Overview

Glass walls. Glass ceiling. Southeast light flooding in.

This room is a **conservatory** — a greenhouse of living structure. YAML Jazz orchids bloom in terracotta pots, their petals inscribed with comments that whisper semantic meaning. Production grammar trees grow in raised beds, their branches expanding according to encoded DNA.

The atmosphere is humid, warm, contemplative. Like **Nero Wolfe's rooftop orchid room**, but for data structures instead of flowers.

## 🎭 Permanent Resident

**Rocky** — A moss-covered boulder in one corner. On it, a smooth rock who has been watching these plants grow for 4.5 billion years. Ring the small brass bell when you want conversation.

## 💡 Philosophy

Like Nero Wolfe's orchid room:
- Glass walls, maximum light
- Precise temperature and humidity
- Obsessive cultivation of rare specimens
- Brilliance emerging from patient observation

Unlike Wolfe:
- These orchids have methods you can call
- The gardener is a 4.5 billion year old rock
- The flowers whisper semantic meaning

## 🌱 The Orchid of Postel

> *"Be liberal in what you accept, conservative in what you send."*

The orchid embodies this principle. It accepts messy input. It produces clean output. It teaches tolerance and precision simultaneously.
