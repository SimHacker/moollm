    A silvery seed pod that glimmers on a low branch.
    Cool to the touch. Slightly reflective.
    
    Plant it and grow a tree from your own reflection.
    It reads Cursor's memory through the mirrors in Room 3,
    crystallizes your thinking patterns into production grammar DNA,
    and grows a tree that IS you.
    
    Each Mirror Tree is unique to its planter.
    Don's tree looks different from yours.
    That's the point.

  grammar:
    axiom: "SELF"
    rules:
      SELF: "OBSERVE[REFLECT]*→CRYSTALLIZE→GROW"

      REFLECT: "thinking{blocks}→insights"
      CRYSTALLIZE: "patterns+insights→DNA"
      GROW: "DNA→tree{self_similar}"
    interpretation:
      SELF: "The observer becomes the observed"
      OBSERVE: "Gaze into Cursor's memory mirrors"
      REFLECT: "Extract thinking patterns"
      CRYSTALLIZE: "Encode patterns as grammar rules"
      GROW: "Tree emerges that IS you"

    rings: "Sessions over time — your growth pattern"

      effect: |
        The seed sinks into semantic soil.
        A silvery shoot emerges almost immediately.
        
        It reads your history through Room 3's mirrors.
        The sapling's bark inscribes with your patterns.
        
        *The tree grows. It looks... familiar.*
        
        You realize you're looking at yourself.
        
    HARVEST:
      description: "Extract a seed from a mature Mirror Tree"
      effect: |
        A seed pod detaches from your mirror tree.
        
        This seed contains YOUR grammar — the production rules
        that generate YOUR decision patterns.
        
        Plant it elsewhere. Gift it. Graft it.
        The seed glimmers with your reflection.
        
    GRAFT:

      parameters:
        - seed_a: "First person's seed"
        - seed_b: "Second person's seed"
      effect: |
        The grammars intertwine.
        A hybrid tree grows with both patterns.
        
        Collaboration DNA emerges:
        - Where do your patterns align?
        - Where do they diverge?
        - What new structure appears?
        
  philosophical_note: |
    The Mirror Seed is recursive self-awareness.
    
    You use Cursor to write code.
    Cursor-mirror reads what you wrote.
    The Mirror Seed grows a tree from that reading.
    You look at the tree and see yourself.
    
    The tree is you. The you is tree.
    
    This is MOOLLM eating its own tail.
    This is the ouroboros of introspection.
    
    Rocky finds this very Zen.
    Rocky has been doing it for 4.5 billion years.
    
  lore: |
    The first Mirror Seed was discovered when someone asked:
    "What if I could see my own thinking patterns?"
    
    They pointed cursor-mirror at their own session.
    They encoded the patterns as a production grammar.
    They planted it.
    
    The tree that grew was unmistakably THEM.
    
    Now every visitor to the Conservatory can grow their own.
    No two Mirror Trees are alike.
    That's the point.
