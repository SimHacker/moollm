# A living embodiment of Postel's Law

  description: |
    A rare orchid grows in a copper pot near the glass wall.
    Its roots spread wide, accepting nutrients from any source.
    Its bloom is precise, a single perfect purple flower.
    
    A small card reads:
    
    > "Be liberal in what you accept,
    >  conservative in what you emit."
    > — Jon Postel, RFC 761 (1980)
    
    The orchid embodies this. It tolerates poor soil, irregular
    watering, imperfect light. But when it blooms, the flower
    is exquisite. Precise. Correct.
    
  examine: |
    You look closely at the Orchid of Postel.
    
    **THE ROOTS** — Liberal acceptance:
    - Sprawl wide, gathering from everywhere
    - Accept partial nutrients, impure water
    - Tolerate variations in soil pH
    - "Good enough" inputs are processed
    
    **THE STEM** — Internal transformation:
    - Filters and normalizes
    - Converts chaos to order
    - The messy becomes structured
    
    **THE BLOOM** — Conservative emission:
    - Single perfect flower
    - Precise petal geometry
    - Exact color spectrum
    - Canonical, reproducible output
    
    A greenhouse journal nearby notes:
    "Fed orchid YAML with missing quotes, inconsistent
    indentation, and rogue tabs. Orchid accepted it.
    Output: perfectly valid YAML."
    
  state:
    health: excellent
    blooming: true
    last_fed: "chaotic user input"
    last_output: "clean, canonical format"

      parameters:
        - input: "Whatever format, however broken"
      effect: |
        The roots absorb the input.
        Internal transformation begins.
        The orchid does not complain.

        Canonical format. Clean. Precise.
        Whatever went in, comes out correct.

        The orchid's petals glow faintly.
        
        "I was planted in 1980, when Jon Postel wrote:
        'An implementation should be conservative in its
        sending behavior, and liberal in its receiving behavior.'
        
        I have been accepting messy TCP packets ever since.
        I have been emitting clean protocols for 46 years.
        
        The internet works because of me."
        
  lore: |
    The Orchid of Postel was a gift from a network engineer
    who understood that perfect inputs are a fantasy.
    
    "Users will always send garbage," she said.
    "The question is whether you crash or adapt."
    
    The orchid adapts. It always has.
    
  philosophical_note: |
    Postel's Law is the robustness principle:
    - Accept: messy YAML, weird indentation, missing fields
    - Emit: canonical, valid, precise output
    
    LLMs naturally embody this. They're trained on the chaos
    of the internet. They emit structured responses.
    
    The orchid is their botanical ancestor.
