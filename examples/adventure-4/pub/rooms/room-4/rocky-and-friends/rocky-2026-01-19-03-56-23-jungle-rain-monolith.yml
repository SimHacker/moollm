  PHOTOREALISTIC. Blade Runner rain aesthetic meets lush steamy jungle.
  
  THE SCENE: A massive granite monolith (Rocky) rises from the jungle floor, but this Rocky has PLATEAUS and LEVELS — natural ledges, shelves, and perches carved by millennia of erosion. Warm tropical rain pours down in sheets. Steam rises from the warm ground. Everything glistens.
  
  THE RAIN:
  - Heavy Blade Runner-style rain — dramatic vertical sheets
  - Warm tropical monsoon, NOT cold — steam rising, humidity visible
  - Neon-like bioluminescence glowing from jungle plants
  - Misty atmosphere, god rays cutting through rain and canopy
  
  THE MONOLITH (Rocky):
  - Ancient granite rising 15 feet, multiple natural plateaus
  - Moss and ferns growing in crevices
  - Wet stone gleaming in the rain
  - Natural shelves at different heights for animals to perch
  
  THE ANIMALS (20 total — ALL wet but warm and happy):
  
  CATS (on upper levels, of course):
  - TERPIE (calico queen): Highest plateau, surveying her domain, wet fur plastered elegant
  - STROOPWAFEL (ginger): Just below Terpie, dignified despite being soaked
  
  KITTENS (8 terpene babies, scattered on mid-levels):
  - Various colors — tabby, ginger, calico, grey
  - Some huddled together under leaf overhangs
  - Some playing in the rain, batting at droplets
  - Some grooming wet fur, looking annoyed but warm
  - Tiny wet fuzzballs on every ledge
  
  ADULT DOGS (lower levels, guarding):
  - BISCUIT (golden retriever): Wet golden fur clinging, still smiling, protecting kittens above
  - BUTTERSCOTCH (yellow lab): Matriarch stance, wet but proud, watching over everyone
  
  PUPPIES (8, scattered throughout):
  - PEPPER (tiny chihuahua): Perched on GOLIATH's head even in the rain, enormous wet ears
  - GOLIATH (giant Great Dane): Blue-grey, massive, standing at Rocky's base like a guardian
  - TEDDY (fluffy Bernese mix): Absolutely SOAKED fluff, still gentle eyes
  - MAPLE (German Shepherd mix): Alert, guarding, one ear up one flopping with water
  - BRUNO (brindle Boxer): Tongue out catching raindrops, LOVING this
  - DASH (Border Collie): Trying to organize everyone to shelter, intense
  - ZIGGY (spotted Dalmatian): Dancing in the rain, spots gleaming wet
  - MOCHI (Shiba mix): Under a leaf overhang, judging everyone getting wet, pristine
  
  THE JUNGLE:
  - Massive tropical trees with aerial roots and vines
  - Orchids and bromeliads on branches
  - Giant ferns and monstera leaves
  - Bioluminescent fungi glowing soft blue/green
  - Mist and steam rising from warm ground
  
  THE WILDLIFE:
  - Colorful tropical BIRDS perched in trees — toucans, parrots, birds of paradise
  - Some birds sheltering, some enjoying the rain
  - INSECTS buzzing — fireflies glowing, butterflies taking shelter
  - Moths drawn to bioluminescent plants
  - Dragonflies hovering despite rain
  - The jungle is ALIVE with creatures
  
  ATMOSPHERE:
  - Warm, humid, steamy — like a tropical greenhouse in monsoon
  - Nobody is cold — fur is wet but bodies are warm
  - Steam rises from warm animal bodies in cool rain
  - Bioluminescence creates magical glow through rain sheets
  
  LIGHTING:
  - Diffuse grey sky with occasional lightning flash
  - Bioluminescent plants providing ethereal underglow
  - Rain catching light, each droplet visible
  - Blade Runner neon aesthetic from glowing plants
  
  MOOD: Primal, magical, alive. An ancient monolith claimed by a found family in a living, breathing, steaming jungle. Nature in its full wet glory.
  
  STYLE: Photorealistic, National Geographic meets Blade Runner. Hyperrealistic water and fur textures. Every raindrop, every wet whisker, every steaming breath visible. 8K cinematic.
