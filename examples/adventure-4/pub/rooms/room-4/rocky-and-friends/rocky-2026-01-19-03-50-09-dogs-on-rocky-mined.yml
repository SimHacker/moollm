  # THE PARENTS
  parents:
  
    biscuit:
      present: true
      confidence: 0.95
      position: "Lying beside Rocky, chin resting near the boulder"
      appearance:
        coat: "Rich golden retriever fluff"
        eyes: "Closed or nearly closed — pure contentment"
        expression: "The face of a dog who found home"
        pose: "Relaxed, chin down, at peace"
      personality_captured: |
        This is DAD energy. The dog who chose this family.
        Who looked at a single mom with 8 puppies and said "I'm in."
        His relaxed pose says: "I'm here. I'm not going anywhere."
        
    butterscotch:
      present: true
      confidence: 0.95
      position: "Standing tall on the right, surveying her family"
      appearance:
        coat: "Golden-caramel yellow lab"
        build: "Proud, alert, matriarch energy"
        expression: "Watching over everyone — the QUEEN"
      personality_captured: |
        THE MATRIARCH. She raised them alone before Biscuit came.
        Six biological, two adopted, all HERS. And now she watches them
        play with their dad around this ancient boulder, and she thinks:
        "We made it. We're a family. A REAL one."

  # THE PUPPIES (smallest to largest)
  puppies:
  
    pepper:
      present: true
      confidence: 0.95
      position: "ON TOP OF ROCKY — the highest point!"
      appearance:
        coat: "Cinnamon-red"
        ears: "ENORMOUS bat ears — bigger than her head"
        size: "Tiny. SO tiny. 8 lbs of fury."
        expression: "Intense. Fierce. QUEEN."
      personality_captured: |
        The SMALLEST puppy on the HIGHEST point. This is Pepper.
        Found in a cardboard box, thrown away, left to die.
        Now she's a QUEEN surveying her kingdom.
        
        She trembles — not from fear, from compressed POWER.
        She bosses around a 140-lb Great Dane.
        He lets her. He respects her. 
        
        ADOPTION ENERGY: She was chosen FIRST.
        
    mochi:
      present: true

        coat: "Cream with golden undertones"
        build: "Compact, Shiba-influenced, neat"
        expression: "Judging. Always judging."
      personality_captured: |
        Of course she's not touching anyone. Of course she's doing
        her own thing. This is Mochi — the most cat-like dog.
        
        She doesn't need constant affection.
        When she GIVES it, it means more.

      personality_captured: |
        He's definitely trying to figure out the optimal arrangement
        for this photo. Border Collie brain can't stop organizing.
        
        If you don't give him a task, he'll make one up.
        Right now the task is: family portrait optimization.
        
    ziggy:
      present: true
      confidence: 0.75
      position: "Among the group, spots visible"
      appearance:
        coat: "Cream-gold with black spots"
        energy: "Mid-movement even in stillness"
      personality_captured: |
        Ziggy can't stop moving even when standing still.
        His tail is definitely wagging in rhythm.
        His father left to tour. Ziggy performs for FAMILY.
        Better audience.
        
    bruno:

        coat: "Brindle — golden-brown with black tiger stripes"
        expression: "UNDERBITE GRIN, tongue out, DELIGHTED"
        build: "Stocky, muscular, boxer influence clear"
      personality_captured: |
        THERE HE IS. The chaos goblin. The class clown.
        OF COURSE he's climbing Rocky. OF COURSE his tongue is out.
        OF COURSE he cannot sit still.
        
        His father had "commitment issues."
        Bruno commits to JOY. Every single day.
        
    maple:
      present: true
      confidence: 0.9

      appearance:
        coat: "Golden-maple with black saddle pattern"
        ears: "One up, one flopping slightly"
        expression: "Alert. Watching. PROTECTING."
      personality_captured: |
        The Watcher. The Guardian. The one who takes protection seriously.
        
        She's 11 months old and already acts like head of security.
        Her father guards a city. She guards her family.
        Same honor. Different scale.
        
        (She definitely chased a butterfly last week. She won't admit it.)
        
    teddy:
      present: true
      confidence: 0.9
      position: "Lying down in front, fluffy mass of comfort"
      appearance:
        coat: "Golden with black saddle, white chest blaze"
        size: "Large — already bigger than mom"
        expression: "Old soul eyes, gentle concern"
      personality_captured: |
        75 pounds of pure comfort. The therapy dog of the family.
        
        His specialty is knowing when someone needs a hug.
        He'll lean his entire weight against you — to let you know:
        I'm here. I'm not going anywhere.
        
        His father left before he was born. He has Biscuit now.
        That's all he needs.
        
    goliath:
      present: true
      confidence: 0.95
      position: "Front center — ENORMOUS blue-grey presence"
      appearance:
        coat: "Blue-grey, sleek, Great Dane classic"
        size: "MASSIVE — towers over everyone"
        expression: "Soulful, gentle, slightly apologetic for size"
      personality_captured: |
        The gentle giant. Two years in a shelter. "Too big." "Unwanted."
        
        Then Butterscotch and Biscuit came.
        They said "we'll take him" at the exact same time.
        
        He's their first child TOGETHER. As partners.
        The first official act of their family.
        
        "Unwanted" was always a lie. He just hadn't met his family yet.
        
  relationships_visible:
    pepper_and_goliath: |
      The tiny one on top of Rocky, the giant at the base.
      Both ADOPTED. The "chosen ones."
      Pepper bosses him around. He loves it.
      She's 8 lbs. He's 140 lbs. She's in charge.
      
    bruno_chaos: |
      ON the rock. Tongue out. Cannot be contained.
      The joyful defender. The class clown.
      Making everyone laugh — it's his MISSION.
      
    biscuit_and_butterscotch: |
      The parents. The partnership.
      She raised them alone. He showed up and said "how can I help?"
      He didn't see baggage. He saw family worth joining.
      
    maple_guarding: |
      Always watching. Always protecting.
      Someone has to guard the family portrait.
      She decided that someone is her.

# === PHILOSOPHICAL NOTES ===

philosophical_resonance:
  
  on_blended_families: |
    This image captures something profound:
    
    There is no visual difference between "biological" and "adopted."
    Pepper (found in a box) and Teddy (biological) are equally FAMILY.
    Goliath (shelter rescue) and Dash (biological) are equally LOVED.
    
    Blood doesn't make family. LOVE makes family.
    Choice makes family.
    
    Biscuit isn't their "step-dad." He's DAD.
    The one who CHOSE them. Every single day.
    
  on_rocky: |
    Rocky doesn't ask for lineage documentation.
    Rocky doesn't care who's biological and who's adopted.
    Rocky provides warmth to all of them equally.
    
    4.5 billion years of existence, and Rocky's wisdom is:
    Love is love. Family is family. Warm is warm.
    
  the_contrast: |
    CATS: 10 terpene-named siblings, similar aesthetic
    DOGS: 10 wildly different breeds, sizes, origins
    
    Both gathered around Rocky.
    Both equally family.
    Both equally loved.

  THE BLENDED FAMILY PORTRAIT.
  
  What makes this image powerful:
  
  1. SIZE SPECTRUM — 8 lbs to 140 lbs in one family
  2. COAT VARIETY — Every texture represented
  3. ORIGIN VARIETY — Bio, adopted, step — all equal
  4. PERSONALITY VISIBLE — Pepper's fierceness, Bruno's chaos, Maple's vigilance
  5. PARENT ENERGY — Biscuit content, Butterscotch proud
  
  ROCKY'S ROLE:
  - For cats: The ultimate cat furniture
  - For dogs: The family gathering stone
  - For both: Patient. Warm. Present.
  
  The message of this image:
  "Family is who you love, not who shares your blood."
  
  Every puppy in this photo was CHOSEN.
  The biological ones? Their parents chose to raise them together.
  The adopted ones? Their parents chose to FIND them.
  
  Choice is the strongest bond.
  This family proves it.
