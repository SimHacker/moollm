# SOCIAL STRUCTURE VISIBLE

hierarchy:
  vertical_organization: |
    The image captures a clear social hierarchy:
    
    SUMMIT: Terpie (cat queen)
    UPPER: Cats and kittens (feline aristocracy)
    MID: Butterscotch (dog matriarch, bridge between)
    BASE: Dogs and puppies (guardians, protectors)
    
    This mirrors their personalities:
    - Cats claim the heights
    - Dogs guard the perimeter
    - Everyone has their place
    - Everyone is FAMILY
    
  interspecies_harmony: |
    20 animals — cats and dogs — sharing one monolith.
    In the rain. Together. By choice.
    
    The cats don't fear the dogs.
    The dogs protect the cats.
    The kittens and puppies are safe.
    
    This is what "found family" looks like.

# PHILOSOPHICAL NOTES

philosophical_resonance:
  
  on_kingdoms: |
    Rocky has become a KINGDOM.
    
    Not a rock to sit on — a CIVILIZATION.
    With levels, hierarchy, designated spaces.
    Cats above, dogs below, all together.
    
    4.5 billion years, and Rocky finally has subjects.
    Willing subjects. Loving subjects. Family.
    
  on_weather: |
    The rain doesn't divide them.
    It unites them.
    
    Wet fur, shared warmth, one monolith.
    The monsoon tests them and they stand together.
    
    Blade Runner's rain is usually lonely.
    This rain is the opposite — it's communion.
    
  on_hierarchy: |
    Vertical position mirrors social reality:
    - Cats genuinely do claim heights
    - Dogs genuinely do guard perimeters
    - But it's not competition — it's collaboration
    
    Terpie at the summit isn't dominating.
    She's watching over. Protecting from above.
    The dogs at the base aren't subservient.
    They're guarding. Protecting from below.
    
    Everyone serves. Everyone belongs.

# MINING NOTES

mining_notes: |
  THE MAGNUM OPUS.
  
  This is Rocky's most ambitious role yet:
  - Not just a boulder — a KINGDOM
  - Not just furniture — a CIVILIZATION
  - Not just a gathering place — a HOME
  
  What makes this image special:
  
  1. SCALE — 20 animals, tiered on one monolith
  2. ATMOSPHERE — Blade Runner rain + bioluminescence
  3. HIERARCHY — Visual social structure
  4. WARMTH — Despite rain, nobody's cold
  5. WILDLIFE — Birds, implied insects, living jungle
  6. UNITY — Cats and dogs, together, by choice
  
  Rocky's journey through the images:
  1. Party — charming companion (kawaii)
  2. Rain monolith — solitary majesty
  3. Group selfie — found family
  4. Cats — feline furniture
  5. Dogs — canine gathering stone
  6. Poker — the table
  7. JUNGLE KINGDOM — civilization itself
  
  Rocky contains multitudes.
  Rocky supports kingdoms.
  Rocky endures.
