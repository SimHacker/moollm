## 📖 The Story

Rocky doesn't move. Rocky doesn't speak. Rocky doesn't have to.

Everyone comes to Rocky. Cats pile on him in the sunlit hothouse. Dogs gather around him in pack formations. Puppies use him as a poker table (Pepper sits on Goliath's head for a better view). Theo the Logo Turtle orbits him drawing spirographs on the floor. Even the rain falls differently around Rocky — warm and tropical, never cold.

Eight images capture this gravitational pull:

The Exhaustive Party puts everyone in frame — Pee-wee, I-Beam, Logo Turtle, Shuffle, Terpie, Confetti Crawler, Captain Ashford. The Rain Monolith reimagines Rocky as a Kubrick obelisk meets Blade Runner atmosphere. The Group Hug Selfie shows everyone squeezing in, photographed by Selfie who is never in their own photos. And Puppies Playing Poker — eight puppies in classic Coolidge composition, Rocky as the table, Pepper perched on Goliath's massive head.

Rocky is the center. Rocky is always the center.
