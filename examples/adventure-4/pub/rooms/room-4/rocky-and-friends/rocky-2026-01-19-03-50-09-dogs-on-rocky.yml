  PHOTOREALISTIC. A magnificent glass conservatory flooded with gorgeous vivid sunlight streaming through tall Victorian windows. Lush tropical vegetation — orchids, ferns, palms — creating a jungle paradise.
  
  CENTER: A large, smooth, sun-warmed granite boulder (Rocky) sits on a bed of soft moss.
  
  THE DOG FAMILY (10 total, each expressing their unique personality):
  
  PARENT DOGS:
  - BISCUIT (golden retriever mix, 65 lbs): Fluffy golden fur, perpetually wagging tail, lying contentedly beside Rocky with his chin resting on the boulder's surface. Brown eyes full of pure love. White whisker marks. The DAD energy radiating from every pore.
  
  - BUTTERSCOTCH (yellow lab mix, 65 lbs): Golden-caramel matriarch standing protectively, soft brown eyes surveying her family with pride. The QUEEN of this pack. Watching over everyone.
  
  THE PUPPIES (arranged showing relationships and personalities):
  
  - PEPPER (tiny 8-lb chihuahua mix, cinnamon-red): Perched ON TOP of Rocky's highest point like a queen claiming her throne. ENORMOUS bat ears, intense dark eyes, trembling with compressed intensity (not fear!). Smallest puppy, biggest attitude. Looking down at giant Goliath below her.
  
  - MOCHI (35-lb shiba/lab mix): Off to the side, grooming herself like a cat, cream-gold coat with curly tail. NOT touching anyone. Judging. Perfect eyeliner markings. The cats love her.
  
  - DASH (45-lb border collie/lab mix): Black coat with white blaze, one brown eye one amber eye (heterochromia). Sitting at attention, clearly ORGANIZING something — maybe trying to herd his siblings into position. Intense stare. Head tilted at exactly 45 degrees.
  
  - ZIGGY (45-lb dalmatian/lab mix): MID-DANCE on the moss beside Rocky! Cream-gold coat covered in black spots, one spot over eye like a beauty mark. Spotted ears bouncing. Tail wagging IN RHYTHM. Cannot stop moving.
  
  - BRUNO (55-lb boxer/lab mix): Brindle coat showing every muscle, signature UNDERBITE GRIN with tongue out. Climbing Rocky like a jungle gym. Pure chaos energy. Cannot sit still. Looking absolutely DELIGHTED.
  
  - MAPLE (55-lb german shepherd/lab mix): Golden-maple fur with black saddle pattern. One ear up, one ear flopping. Standing guard near Ziggy's performance. Alert, serious, watching the perimeter. PROTECTING.
  
  - TEDDY (75-lb bernese/lab mix): MASSIVE fluffy golden pup with black saddle and white heart-shaped chest blaze. Leaning his entire weight against Rocky lovingly. Old soul eyes. Living heated blanket.
  
  - GOLIATH (140-lb great dane mix): ENORMOUS blue-grey gentle giant. Trying to make himself small near Rocky's base (impossible). Looking up at tiny Pepper on top of the rock with confused adoration. She bosses him around and he LOVES it.
  
  RELATIONSHIPS VISIBLE:
  - Pepper standing over Goliath (the chosen ones, both adopted)
  - Bruno and Ziggy in chaos-dance partnership
  - Maple guarding Ziggy's performance
  - Teddy and Goliath as the gentle giant squad
  - Biscuit watching everyone with proud dad tears in his eyes
  - Butterscotch surveying her kingdom
  
  SETTING:
  - Victorian glass conservatory, ornate iron framework
  - Streaming golden sunlight with visible god rays
  - Lush orchids in bloom — purple, white, coral
  - Ferns, palms, moss, trailing vines
  
  MOOD: Warm, playful, CHAOTIC but loving. A blended family that CHOSE each other.
  
  STYLE: National Geographic quality. Hyperrealistic fur textures — every coat type distinct. Smooth vs fluffy vs brindle vs spotted. Family portrait energy. 8K detail.
