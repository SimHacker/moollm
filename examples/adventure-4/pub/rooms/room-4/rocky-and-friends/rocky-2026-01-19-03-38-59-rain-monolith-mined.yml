# === SUBJECT ===

characters:
  rocky:
    present: true
    confidence: 0.99                    # Unmistakably Rocky
    scale: "MASSIVE"                    # Mission accomplished!
    notes: |
      Rocky dominates the frame — easily 25-30 feet tall in this
      rendering. The boulder commands the entire composition with
      geological authority. This is Rocky as MONOLITH, as primordial
      presence, as 4.5 billion years of patient observation made visible.
      
  selfie:
    present: "behind camera"            # The invisible photographer
    notes: |
      Rocky is a boulder. Rocky has NO ARMS. Every photo of Rocky
      requires Selfie's help! This is a symbiotic relationship:
      - Rocky provides: patience, presence, 4.5 billion years of wisdom
      - Selfie provides: hands, camera, the ability to document
      
      Selfie is almost certainly here, shimmering invisibly, holding
      the Prototype Camera steady in the rain. The mist might even
      be obscuring a gentle shimmer at the edge of the frame...

    achieved: 0.9                       # Very close to photographic
    notes: |
      This could almost pass for a photograph. The lighting physics
      are correct, the rain behavior is realistic, the textures are
      detailed. Only slight "AI smoothness" in some areas.
      
  composition:

    camera_position: "Low, looking up at monolith"
    subject_placement: "Center, filling vertical space"

  intensity: 0.95                       # Powerful emotional impact
  notes: |
    This image evokes genuine awe. Rocky isn't cute here — Rocky
    is PRIMORDIAL. This is the rock that was here before trees,
    before animals, before consciousness. And it will be here after.

philosophical_resonance:
  deep_time: 0.95                       # Rocky's 4.5 billion years is FELT
  insignificance: 0.9                   # Viewer feels appropriately small
  persistence: 0.95                     # Rocky endures all weather

  elements_partial:
    - "8K detail" # Can't verify resolution, but detail is high
    - "Mica sparkle" # Subtle, present but not prominent
    
  elements_missing:
    - "Rain streaks in foreground" # Rain visible but not streak-emphasized
    
  style_accuracy: |
    This is EXACTLY what was requested. The prompt said "Roger Deakins
    cinematography meets Ansel Adams landscape photography" and that's
    precisely what we got. The god rays are Deakins. The geological
    reverence is Adams. The rain is Blade Runner. Perfect synthesis.

# === COMPARISON TO PREVIOUS ===

comparison:
  previous_image: "rocky-2026-01-19-03-25-20-party-exhaustive.png"
  this_image: "rocky-2026-01-19-03-38-59-rain-monolith.png"
  
  trajectory_shift:
    from: "Kawaii illustration, colorful, charming, indoor"
    to: "Photorealistic, dramatic, awe-inspiring, outdoor"
    
  what_changed:
    - style: "Folk art illustration → Cinematic photorealism"
    - mood: "Whimsical peace → Primordial awe"
    - scale: "Medium boulder → MASSIVE monolith"
    - setting: "Conservatory interior → Rainy forest"
    - lighting: "Warm ambient → Dramatic god rays"
    - rocky_characterization: "Cute with face → Pure geological majesty"
    
  iteration_success: |
    This demonstrates the power of prompt iteration. The previous
    image was charming but didn't capture Rocky's SCALE or ancient
    nature. This image delivers on "4.5 billion years of patient
    observation" in a way the first couldn't.
    
    The raw prompt approach (vs LLM synthesis) gave us precise
    control over the vision. When you know exactly what you want,
    skip the synthesis and go direct.

# === MINING NOTES ===

exhausted: false
mining_notes: |
  THIS IS THE ONE. This image captures Rocky's true nature — not
  cute, not anthropomorphized, but ANCIENT. MASSIVE. ETERNAL.
  
  The iteration from the first image worked beautifully:
  - Previous: Charming illustration, Rocky has a kawaii face
  - This: Cinematic realism, Rocky is pure geological majesty
  
  The raw prompt approach (skipping LLM synthesis) gave precise
  control. When you know exactly what you want — specify it directly.
  
  KEY LEARNINGS FOR FUTURE PROMPTS:
  1. "MASSIVE" works — emphasize scale explicitly
  2. "Photorealistic" overrides illustration tendencies
  3. "No anthropomorphization" prevents cute faces
  4. Specific cinematographer references (Deakins) guide style
  5. Weather (rain, mist) adds atmosphere and mood
  6. Lighting direction ("god rays", "chiaroscuro") is respected
  
  NEXT ITERATION IDEAS:
  - Try sunset/golden hour for even more dramatic light
  - Add a tiny human figure for scale comparison
  - Try different weather: snow, fog, dramatic clouds
  - Try close-up: mica details, surface textures
