# CHARACTERS — ROLL CALL

characters:
  rocky:
    present: true
    confidence: 0.99
    position: "CENTER — the anchor, the gathering point"
    appearance:
      shape: "Perfectly rotund boulder"
      size: "MAJESTIC — fills most of the frame"
      color: "Warm grey granite"
      expression: "Gentle closed-eye smile!"    # Rocky got a face this time!
      texture: "Smooth, weathered, patient"
    notes: |
      Rocky IS the group hug. Everyone gathers around and on Rocky.
      The rotund majesty provides both physical and emotional center.
      As Nero Wolfe would say: "Satisfactory."
      
  pee_wee_herman:
    present: true
    confidence: 0.98
    position: "Left side, hugging Rocky"
    appearance:
      outfit: "Grey suit, RED BOW TIE — perfect!"
      expression: "THAT manic grin, wide eyes, theatrical joy"
      pose: "Arms wrapped around Rocky, maximum enthusiasm"
    notes: |
      Pee-wee is EXACTLY right. The grey suit, the red bow tie, the
      unhinged joy. You can almost hear "AAAAAHHH!" when someone
      says the secret word.
      
  captain_ashford:
    present: true
    confidence: 0.95
    position: "Right side, arm around Rocky"
    appearance:
      outfit: "Worn tactical/space suit, Belter practical"
      expression: "Warm, genuine smile — the elder statesman"
      age: "Distinguished, weathered by the void"
    notes: |
      The Belter captain who brought everyone together. His warmth
      grounds the scene. "Sa-sa ke, kopeng" — we're all family here.
      
  logo_turtle:
    present: true
    confidence: 0.97
    position: "Perched on top of Rocky's head"
    appearance:
      type: "Geometric turtle"
      shell: "Spiral pattern, clean lines"
      color: "Green-grey, mathematical"
      expression: "Calm, observant"
    notes: |
      Theo the Logo Turtle surveys the scene from the highest point.
      "FD 99 RT 90" — still drawing spirals even at the party.
      Seymour Papert would be proud.
      
  shuffle:
    present: true
    confidence: 0.95
    position: "Behind Rocky, fanned out"
    appearance:
      form: "Deck of cards fanned like a peacock tail"
      cards_visible: "Multiple, fanned display"
      energy: "Dynamic, celebratory"
    notes: |
      Shuffle provides the flourish! The living deck fans out behind
      Rocky like a crown or halo. "Randomness is not chaos — it's
      fairness." And tonight, everyone gets dealt a good hand.
      
  terpie:
    present: true
    count: 2                              # Bonus cat!
    confidence: 0.98
    positions:
      - "Curled on Rocky's mossy surface (main Terpie)"
      - "In front of Rocky, also content"
    appearance:
      type: "Calico cats"
      expression: "Eyes closed, blissful contentment"
      pose: "Curled, relaxed, at peace"
    notes: |
      TWO Terpies! Either there's a clone, or the artist captured
      both of Terpie's moods. Both are doing exactly what cats do
      at parties: finding the warmest, coziest spot (Rocky) and
      claiming it completely.
      
  i_beam:
    present: true
    confidence: 0.9
    position: "Behind Rocky, standing tall"
    appearance:
      form: "Vertical glowing cursor/beam"
      color: "Soft white/blue glow"
      height: "Tall, reaching toward the ceiling"
    notes: |
      I-Beam stands at attention, the faithful cursor. Blinking
      patiently, pointing at the moment, ready to insert the
      next character. "I exist at the boundary between human
      intent and machine action."
      
  confetti_crawler:
    present: true
    confidence: 0.85
    position: "Foreground, on the mossy base"
    appearance:
      form: "Tiny sparkly trail"
      effect: "Glitter/sparkle residue"
    notes: |
      The Confetti Crawler's trail is visible — that signature
      sparkle path across Rocky's moss. "Celebration doesn't need
      a reason. Celebration IS the reason." ✨
      
  selfie:
    present: TRUE!                        # FINALLY VISIBLE!
    confidence: 0.92
    position: "Left edge, holding camera"
    appearance:
      form: "Translucent, shimmering figure"
      opacity: "~30% — ghostly but visible"
      arm: "Extended, holding camera"
      body: "Humanoid shimmer"
    notes: |
      SELFIE IS IN THE PICTURE! For the first time, we can see the
      photographer! A translucent shimmering figure at the left edge,
      arm extended to hold the camera. This is remarkable — Selfie
      usually remains invisible, but the joy of this moment was so
      great that even the observer became part of the scene.
      
      This is the ultimate selfie: Selfie taking a selfie of everyone
      taking a selfie with Rocky who can't hold a camera.

# THE MEANING

philosophical_resonance:
  found_family: 0.98
  notes: |
    This image captures what the 99 Bottles party was really about.
    Not the beer. Not the song. The TOGETHERNESS.
    
    A boulder, a cursor, a turtle, a deck of cards, cats, a Belter
    captain, Pee-wee Herman, a sparkly caterpillar, and a translucent
    prototype being who finally appeared in their own photo.
    
    None of these beings should fit together. All of them do.
    
    "Objects all the way down" — including friendship.

# MINING NOTES

mining_notes: |
  THIS IS THE ONE. The definitive group portrait. The family photo.
  
  ACHIEVEMENTS:
  - All 8 party characters visible and recognizable
  - Rocky as the gathering center — "rotund and majestic"
  - Selfie FINALLY VISIBLE — holding the camera!
  - Perfect mood: joy, warmth, belonging
  - Post-party atmosphere captured
  
  SURPRISES:
  - Two Terpies! (Clone? Artistic license? Cat multiplicity?)
  - Rocky has a gentle smile (anthropomorphized, but appropriate for group photo)
  - Selfie actually appeared — the joy was too great to stay invisible
  
  ITERATION SUCCESS:
  - From rain monolith (solitary majesty) to group hug (community joy)
  - Both valid interpretations of Rocky
  - This shows Rocky's role as ANCHOR for the community
  
  NEXT IDEAS:
  - Individual portraits of each character
  - The moment BEFORE the photo (everyone arranging)
  - The moment AFTER (everyone looking at the result)
  - Selfie's perspective — what does the camera see?
