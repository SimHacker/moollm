prompt: |
  BRIGHT CHILD-FRIENDLY CARTOON STYLE. Pixar/DreamWorks animation aesthetic. Joyful, colorful, whimsical.
  
  THE SCENE: A glass hothouse/conservatory with Victorian windows, but the plants have been pushed to the sides to create a big open floor space. Rocky the boulder sits in the CENTER like the sun, glowing with warmth and happiness.
  
  THE CHARACTERS:
  
  ROCKY (center):
  - A friendly rounded granite boulder with a subtle happy face — gentle eyes, slight smile
  - Sitting in the exact center of the room like the sun
  - Warm grey with mica sparkles that catch the light
  - Patient, loving, the anchor of the scene
  
  THEO THE LOGO TURTLE (orbiting Rocky, drawing):
  - A small mechanical turtle with a shiny shell covered in geometric patterns
  - Bright green with brass/gold accents
  - Big expressive cartoon eyes, full of joy and creativity
  - DANCING around Rocky in a spiral orbit
  - Holding COLORED PENS in his little turtle flippers
  - TRAILING behind him: gorgeous SPIROGRAPH patterns on the floor!
  
  THE FLOOR ART (Theo's masterpiece):
  - Beautiful LAYERED spirograph graffiti covering the entire floor
  - Concentric spiral patterns radiating from Rocky at center
  - LOGO turtle graphics: perfect stars, spirals, geometric flowers
  - Multiple colors layered: red, blue, yellow, green, purple, orange
  - Like a gorgeous rainbow mandala with Rocky at the heart
  - Clean geometric precision but with joyful energy
  
  ONE KITTEN (playing):
  - A fluffy ginger kitten (could be one of the terpene kittens)
  - Batting at one of Theo's trailing pen lines
  - Big round cartoon eyes, playful pose
  - Maybe trying to catch the moving pen
  
  ONE PUPPY (playing):
  - A golden fluffy puppy (could be one of Biscuit's kids)
  - Watching Theo draw with amazement
  - Tail wagging, tongue out, cartoon joy
  - Maybe has paw prints in the spirograph (oops!)
  
  THE CONSERVATORY:
  - Bright sunlight streaming through glass ceiling
  - Plants pushed to the edges — orchids, ferns, palms
  - Victorian iron framework visible
  - Clean tiled floor (now covered in beautiful art!)
  - Warm, bright, cheerful atmosphere
  
  COMPOSITION:
  - Rocky at CENTER (like the sun)
  - Theo orbiting Rocky (like a planet), actively drawing
  - Spirograph patterns radiating outward
  - Kitten on one side, puppy on the other
  - Glass ceiling above, art floor below
  
  MOOD: Pure JOY. Friendship. Creativity. The magic of making things together.
  
  STYLE: Bright cartoon, Pixar-quality rendering, child-friendly, big expressive eyes, warm colors, clean lines, joyful energy. Like a children's book illustration come to life. NOT realistic — stylized, friendly, approachable.
