    personality_captured: |
      THIS is Rocky's soul made visible.
      
      Not a geological monument. Not ancient majesty.
      Just... a happy rock. A friend. A center.
      
      The simplicity of the face captures everything:
      Rocky doesn't need complexity to express love.
      Just being there, being warm, being present.
      
      The spirograph radiates FROM Rocky — as if
      Rocky's presence creates the art just by existing.

      The pen in his flipper, the pattern growing,
      the orbit around Rocky — this is his purpose.
      
      "FORWARD hope. RIGHT toward_understanding."
      That's not just Logo code — that's what we're seeing.

      PUPPIES LEARN BY WATCHING.
      
      This puppy is Theo's audience. His student.
      Learning that art happens when you move with purpose.
      
      The blue paw prints say: "I tried to help!"

    2. TIME — Layered drawings = accumulated friendship
       Rocky has been the center for a LONG time
       
    3. ORBIT — Theo dances around Rocky like a planet
       The patterns show the dance frozen in time
       
    4. JOY — Pure colorful creative expression
       No purpose but beauty. No goal but fun.

# === PHILOSOPHICAL NOTES ===

philosophical_resonance:

  on_friendship: |
    "Rocky picked turtle as their spirit animal."
    "Fellow practitioners of stillness, geological timescale buddies."
    
    This image shows that friendship:
    - Stillness and motion can be friends
    - A rock and a turtle understand each other
    - Creating together is the deepest bond
    
  on_constructionism: |
    Seymour Papert's philosophy made visible:
    
    "You can't think about thinking without thinking about something."
    
    Theo isn't just drawing. He's THINKING by drawing.
    The kitten and puppy are LEARNING by watching.
    Rocky is BEING the center of thought.
    
    The magic isn't in the spirograph.
    It's in what happens in your head while making it.
    
  on_joy: |
    This might be the purest image in Rocky's collection.
    
    No rain. No poker. No hierarchy.
    Just: a rock, a turtle, a kitten, a puppy.
    Making art. Together. Happy.
    
    "FORWARD hope. RIGHT toward_understanding.
    REPEAT forever [LEARN MORE]."
    
    That's not just Logo code.
    That's what friendship looks like.
