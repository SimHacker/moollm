      present: "likely"                   # Hard to distinguish from kittens
      confidence: 0.7
      notes: |
        One of the larger ginger cats may be Stroopwafel, though
        the composition focuses on kittens. The adult calico (Terpie)
        is clearly dominant.

    Rocky is UNBOTHERED. Utterly patient. The perfect cat accessory.

    world's best cat tree.
    
    Rocky doesn't need arms. Rocky doesn't need to move.
    Rocky just needs to BE — warm, solid, patient.
    The cats do the rest.

# === PHILOSOPHICAL NOTES ===

philosophical_resonance:
  patience_rewarded: |
    Rocky's 4.5 billion years of patience have led to this moment:
    becoming the perfect warm rock for cats to claim. This is not
    a demotion from "geological consciousness" — this is the highest
    form of being. To be chosen by cats is an honor.
    
  symbiosis: |
    Rocky provides: warmth, texture, stability, height
    Cats provide: life, motion, chaos, cuteness
    Together: perfection
    
  the_conservatory_purpose: |
    The YAML Jazz Conservatory was always meant for this. The orchids,
    the light, the moss — it was always a cat sanctuary waiting to happen.
    Rocky knew. Rocky was patient. The cats came.

# === MINING NOTES ===

mining_notes: |
  PEAK CAT CONTENT ACHIEVED.
  
  This image captures:
  - Rocky as the ultimate patient presence
  - 10 cats in various stages of cat behavior
  - The conservatory in its full glory
  - The warm, sun-drenched sanctuary vibe
  
  The photorealism is excellent — this could be a spread in a
  cat magazine or a National Geographic feature on "unusual
  cat habitats."
  
  ROCKY'S JOURNEY:
  1. Kawaii illustration (charming, face)
  2. Rain monolith (solitary majesty)

  Each image reveals a different aspect of Rocky's nature:
  - Charming companion

  All are true. Rocky contains multitudes.
