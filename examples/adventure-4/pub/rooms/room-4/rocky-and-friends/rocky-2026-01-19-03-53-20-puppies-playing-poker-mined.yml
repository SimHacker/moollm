      Pepper — the 8-lb queen found in a cardboard box —
      is sitting ON TOP of the 140-lb gentle giant.
      She's not at the table. She's ABOVE the table.
      Using Goliath as her throne.

# THE TABLE (ROCKY)

rocky:
  role: "The poker table"
  visible: true
  description: |
    The boulder is now a poker table!
    Green felt draped over Rocky's smooth granite surface.
    Cards, chips, whiskey, cigars scattered on top.
    
    Rocky doesn't care about poker. Rocky just IS.
    4.5 billion years of patience makes for a very stable table.
    
  symbolism: |
    The family gathers around Rocky for:
    - Cat cuddles (cats on rocky)
    - Dog portraits (dogs on rocky)  
    - Poker night (puppies playing poker)
    
    Rocky is the CENTER. The anchor. The gathering stone.

# THE SPECIAL MOMENT

pepper_and_goliath:
  the_dynamic:
    size_difference: "8 lbs vs 140 lbs — 17.5x!"
    position: "Pepper ON TOP of Goliath's head"
    bond: "Both adopted. The chosen ones."
    
  what_it_represents: |
    This is the HEART of the image.
    
    The smallest puppy, found abandoned in a box.
    The biggest puppy, stuck in a shelter for two years.
    
    Both "unwanted." Both CHOSEN.
    
    Now she sits on his head like it's the most natural thing.
    He looks up at her like she's the sun.
    
    Size means nothing. Blood means nothing.
    Choice means everything.
    
  visual_comedy: |
    It's also just FUNNY.
    A tiny fierce chihuahua using a giant Great Dane as furniture.
    He could shake her off. He would NEVER.
    She bosses him around. He adores it.

# PHILOSOPHICAL NOTES

philosophical_resonance:
  
  on_the_chosen_ones: |
    Pepper was thrown in a box. Goliath was left in a cage.
    Both labeled "unwanted."
    
    Now one sits on the other's head at poker night.
    Both part of a family that CHOSE them.
    
    The painting captures this: they're not separate.
    They're a unit. The tiniest and the biggest.
    Opposites who found each other through being different.
    
  on_coolidge_tradition: |
    Coolidge's dogs played poker in 1903.
    These puppies play poker in 2026.
    
    The tradition continues. The aesthetic endures.
    But now it's a BLENDED family.
    Biological, adopted, step — all at the same table.
    All holding cards. All family.
    
  rocky_as_table: |
    Rocky has been:
    - Cat furniture
    - Family portrait backdrop
    - Poker table
    
    Rocky doesn't judge. Rocky just supports.
    Whatever the family needs, Rocky provides.
