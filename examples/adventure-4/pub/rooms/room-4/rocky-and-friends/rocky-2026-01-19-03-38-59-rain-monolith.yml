# SYNTHESIZED PROMPT
# Edit this to regenerate with tweaks!
prompt: |
  A MASSIVE granite boulder dominates the frame, at least 30 feet tall, ancient and weathered. PHOTOREALISTIC outdoor nature scene. Heavy rain falling, Blade Runner-esque drizzle catching light. The boulder sits in a primordial forest clearing — moss-covered ground, towering redwoods fading into mist. 
  
  LIGHTING: Breathtaking. Shafts of golden light break through storm clouds, illuminating the rain drops. The boulder's surface glistens wet, mica flecks sparkling like stars. Volumetric god rays pierce the canopy.
  
  The boulder has a presence, a consciousness — 4.5 billion years of patient observation. No face, no anthropomorphization — just pure geological majesty. The kind of rock that makes you feel small and transient.
  
  Cinematic composition, wide angle, low camera position looking up at the monolith. Rain streaks visible in the foreground. Mist curling at the base. 
  
  Style: Roger Deakins cinematography meets Ansel Adams landscape photography. Hyperrealistic, 8K detail, dramatic chiaroscuro lighting.
