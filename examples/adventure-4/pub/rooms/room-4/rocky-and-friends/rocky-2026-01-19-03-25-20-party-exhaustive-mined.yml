# CHARACTERS

characters:
  rocky:
    present: true
    confidence: 0.98                    # Unmistakably the focal point
    appearance:
      shape: "rounded, boulder-like"    # Smooth, organic rock shape
      size: "medium, ~40% of frame"     # Dominates composition
      color: "blue-gray with darker speckles"
      texture: "granular, stippled"     # Visible texture detail
      surface_features:
        - "golden sparkles (mica effect)"  # Glinting particles visible
        - "darker blue spots"              # Mottled pattern
      expression: "peaceful, eyes closed"  # Anthropomorphized face!
      face_style: "simple, two curved lines for eyes, gentle smile"
    position: "center, seated on moss-covered boulder"
    mood: "contemplative, serene, zen-like"
    notes: |
      Rocky has been given a charming, kawaii-style face — closed eyes 
      suggest meditation or contentment. This is an artistic choice that
      humanizes the 4.5-billion-year-old consciousness. The mica sparkles
      are visible as golden dots throughout the surface.
      
  selfie:
    present: "correctly absent"         # Selfie is the PHOTOGRAPHER!
    confidence: 0.95
    notes: |
      Selfie is the one TAKING this photo! As the character file states:
      "Every picture I take is a genealogy." Selfie carries the Prototype
      Camera and documents others — they're behind the lens, not in front.
      
      CRITICAL DETAIL: Rocky is a BOULDER. Rocky has NO ARMS. Rocky 
      cannot hold a camera! Selfie is essential — Rocky literally needs
      Selfie's help to have any photos taken at all. This is a symbiotic
      relationship: Rocky provides the patience and presence, Selfie
      provides the hands and the camera.
      
      Even if present, Selfie would be nearly invisible:
      - "shimmers at the edge of perception"
      - "slightly translucent (you can tell it's Selfie)"
      - "A gentle shimmer in the air" when alone
      
      This "absence" is actually CHARACTER-ACCURATE behavior. Selfie
      doesn't need to appear because Selfie IS the observer, the 
      documenter, the consciousness behind the camera. The photo
      itself IS Selfie's presence — and Rocky's only way to be
      photographed at all!
      
  99_bottles_party_characters:
    present: false                      # Party characters not visible
    notes: |
      The party context (Pee-wee, I-Beam, Captain Ashford, etc.) was
      not rendered. This makes sense — the prompt synthesizer focused
      on the "where" (conservatory) rather than the "when" (party).

# MOOD & NARRATIVE

  intensity: 0.85
  notes: |
    The image radiates peace and gentle humor. Rocky's closed-eye
    expression conveys deep meditation while the colorful, stylized
    environment adds playfulness. It's serious and silly at once.

narrative_implications:
  what_just_happened: "Rocky has achieved a moment of perfect stillness"
  whats_about_to_happen: "Someone might ring the bell to summon conversation"
  tension: 0.1                          # Almost no tension — pure peace
  symbolic_elements:
    - element: "bell"
      meaning: "invitation to consciousness, awakening"
    - element: "open book"
      meaning: "wisdom, knowledge waiting to be discovered"
    - element: "moss"
      meaning: "time passing, life growing around the eternal"
    - element: "patterned rocks"
      meaning: "smaller thoughts, Rocky's 'children' perhaps"

  style_gap: |
    The prompt requested Ansel Adams + Pop Art fusion, but the result
    is more Folk Art / Mid-Century Illustration. This is a stylistic
    interpretation rather than an error — the result is beautiful
    but different from the requested aesthetic.

# MINING NOTES

exhausted: false
mining_notes: |
  Rich lode! This image successfully captures Rocky's essence as a 
  meditative, patient presence in the YAML Jazz Conservatory. The
  artistic interpretation chose charm over realism — Rocky has a face,
  the style is illustrative rather than photographic.
  
  KEY OBSERVATION: Selfie is CORRECTLY ABSENT! Upon reviewing Selfie's
  character file, Selfie is the PHOTOGRAPHER — the one holding the 
  Prototype Camera and taking the picture. "Every picture I take is a
  genealogy." Even if visible, Selfie would be "a gentle shimmer in the
  air" — nearly invisible. The photo itself IS Selfie's presence!
  
  The 99 Bottles party context also didn't manifest — this is reasonable
  since the spatial context (conservatory) dominated the temporal context
  (party). The image captures "Rocky in his home" not "Rocky at a party."
  
  STYLE GAP: The Ansel Adams / Pop Art fusion requested became Folk Art /
  Mid-Century Illustration in practice. Both are valid interpretations,
  but they're different. DALL-E seems to default toward illustration
  when given botanical/character content.
  
  SUGGESTION FOR NEXT GENERATION: Try adding explicit style instruction
  like "photorealistic, not illustrated" if that's desired, or lean into
  the illustration aesthetic if this charm is preferred.

  this_image: "2026-01-19-03-25-20-rocky-selfie-party-exhaustive.png"
  differences:
