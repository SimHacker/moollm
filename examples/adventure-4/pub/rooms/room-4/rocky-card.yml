    A smooth, palm-sized card that feels oddly heavy for its size.
    Mica flecks sparkle across its granite-textured surface.
    
    Flip it over. And over. There are somehow six sides.
    Each side serves a different purpose. All sides are true.
    
    Rocky hands these out freely. Time is not money when you have
    4.5 billion years of it.

  lore: |
    Rocky started handing these out around 65 million years ago.
    The dinosaurs were the first recipients.
    
    They didn't understand either. But they appreciated the gesture.
    
    Every rock you've ever seen has one of these cards.
    They just haven't shown you yet.
    You weren't ready.
    
    Are you ready now?
