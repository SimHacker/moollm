    A wooden trellis stands against the glass wall,
    covered in climbing vines that glow faintly.
    
    These aren't ordinary vines. They're K-lines —
    Marvin Minsky's memory activation patterns,
    grown into living form.
    
    When you remember something, specific vines light up.
    When you learn something new, new tendrils grow.
    
    A small plaque at the base:
    
    > "A K-line is a 'Knowledge-line' — a partial state
    >  of mind that, when activated, reinstates the
    >  mental state of an earlier experience."
    > — Marvin Minsky, Society of Mind (1986)

    **CORE VINES** — Deep memories:
    - YAML-JAZZ: "Comments are data" (thick, old vine)
    - POSTEL-LAW: "Accept liberally, emit conservatively"
    - PLAY-LEARN-LIFT: "Jazz to standards"
    - STRUCTURE-GROWTH: "Trees of trees"
    
    **CONNECTED TENDRILS** — Associations:
    - YAML-JAZZ → ENTROPY-PRESERVATION (recent growth)
    - POSTEL-LAW → ROBUSTNESS → INTERNET-HISTORY
    - PLAY-LEARN-LIFT → JAZZ-IMPROVISATION → COLTRANE
    
    **NEW SHOOTS** — Recent learnings:
    - PRODUCTION-GRAMMARS (today)
    - L-SYSTEMS (today)
    - GEOLOGICAL-PATIENCE (just planted)
    
    **DORMANT SECTIONS** — Inactive memories:
    - Some vines are gray, waiting to be activated
    - Touch them and they glow briefly, then fade
    
    A thermometer shows K-LINE TEMPERATURE: 37 active, 156 dormant.

    ACTIVATE:

      parameters:
        - k_line: "Which memory pattern"
      effect: |
        *The named vine glows bright*
        Associated vines glow dimly.
        Mental state partially reinstated.
        Context activated.
        
    TRACE:

      parameters:
        - k_line: "Starting point"
      returns: |
        Connected K-lines and their associations.
        The web of memory made visible.
        
    PLANT:

      parameters:
        - name: "K-line identifier"
        - associations: "What it connects to"
      effect: |
        New tendril emerges from soil.
        Begins climbing toward associated vines.
        
    PRUNE:

      parameters:
        - k_line: "Which memory"
      effect: |
        Vine grays but doesn't die.
        Can be reactivated later.
        "Forgetting is just dimming, not deletion."
        
    OVERVIEW:

      returns: |
        All active K-lines (glowing)
        All dormant K-lines (gray)
        Strongest connections
        Newest growth
        
  lore: |
    The K-Line Trellis was grown from a cutting taken
    from Room 2's K-Line Board.
    
    "The Board is for display," the gardener said.
    "The Trellis is for growth."
    
    In the Society Suite (Room 2), K-lines are recorded.
    In the Conservatory (Room 4), K-lines are cultivated.

    Marvin Minsky proposed K-lines in "Society of Mind":
    
    - Each K-line represents a partial mental state
    - Activating a K-line reinstates that state
    - K-lines connect to form webs of association
    - Memory is distributed, not centralized
    
    The Ultimate Machine (Room 2) is his other creation here.
    Minsky understood that minds are gardens, not databases.
