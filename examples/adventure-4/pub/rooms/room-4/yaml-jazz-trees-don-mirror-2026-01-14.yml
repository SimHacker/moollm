  description: |
    A silver-barked tree with distinctive growth patterns.
    Its branches reach in specific directions.
    Its leaves whisper familiar thoughts.
    
    This tree grew from Don's Cursor session on January 14, 2026.
    77,567 seconds of cognitive activity crystallized into structure.
    
    Look at it and you see how Don works:
    - Shell-first thinking (42.6% of the branches)
    - Edit-heavy workflow (28.9%)
    - Context-gathering roots (19%)
    - Pattern-seeking tendrils (5.1%)
    
    The bark is inscribed with commit messages.
    The rings show session depth over time.

    samples:
      - "The user wants to... Let me first check..."
      - "Now I need to... Let me update..."
      - "Now let me commit all of this."
      - "Done! Let me summarize for the user."
      - "Let me also update..."
      - "Now I have a good picture. Let me..."
      
    pattern: |
      Don's thinking follows a rhythm:
      1. Acknowledge the task ("The user wants...")
      2. Plan the approach ("Let me first...")
      3. Execute iteratively ("Now I need to...")
      4. Commit frequently ("Now let me commit...")
      5. Summarize clearly ("Done! Let me summarize...")

  unique_characteristics:
    # What makes Don's tree distinctive
    
    shell_heavy: |
      Don reaches for the terminal first.
      42.6% of his tool calls are shell commands.
      He thinks in bash.
      
    commit_frequent: |
      Don commits often with descriptive messages.
      Each commit tells a story.
      The bark is thick with inscriptions.
      
    context_deep: |
      Don gathers context before acting.
      Read files, search patterns, understand structure.
      Then edit. Then verify. Then ship.
      
    summary_rich: |
      Don summarizes for the user after each task.
      Markdown tables. Clear explanations.
      The leaves are communication.
      
    error_composting: |
      14 edit failures became learning nutrients.
      Don doesn't hide errors — he composts them.
      The soil is richer for it.
      
  philosophical_reflection: |
    This tree is a snapshot of one person on one day.
    
    If you grew a tree from tomorrow's session, it would be different.
    The branches might reach in new directions.
    The leaves might whisper different thoughts.
    
    But the DNA would be recognizable.
    The pattern would persist.
    
    That's what the Mirror Tree reveals:
    Your style. Your rhythm. Your cognitive signature.
    
    Don's tree says: "Shell first. Edit much. Commit often. Summarize always."
    
    What would YOUR tree say?
    
  rocky_observation: |
    Rocky has been watching this tree grow.

    [Translation: Interesting. You grew a tree in 21 hours
    that encodes your entire cognitive pattern.
    I've been encoding my pattern for 4.5 billion years.
    Your approach is... efficient.
    But you missed some things.
    Give it another few billion years.]
