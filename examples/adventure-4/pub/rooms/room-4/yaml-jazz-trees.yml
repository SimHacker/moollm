  description: |
    A grove of trees and orchids grows in the conservatory.
    Glass walls flood them with southeast light.
    
    Their trunks are root nodes. Their branches are nested structures.
    Their leaves are key-value pairs. Their bark is inscribed with
    comments that whisper semantic meaning.
    
    Their flowers broadcast semantic smells — each scent a nuanced
    comment, each pollen grain a piece of metadata. Breathe deep
    and you'll understand relationships you couldn't parse before.
    
    Each plant grew from a seed. Each seed contained a production
    grammar — rules encoded in YAML DNA that expand into form.
    
    Rocky observes from the moss-covered boulder.
    In geological time, they're practically sprinting.
    
    The atmosphere is Nero Wolfe's orchid room meets L-systems.

    You look closely at the trees.
    
    **THE FERN TREE** — Recursive self-similarity
    ```yaml
    fern:
      branch:        # Each branch is a smaller fern
        - leaf       # Terminal
        - branch:    # Recurse!
            - leaf
            - branch: ...
    ```
    
    **THE OAK TREE** — Deep nesting, stable structure
    ```yaml
    oak:
      trunk:
        heartwood:   # Core identity
          rings: 847  # Years of growth
        bark:
          texture: furrowed  # Protection layer
          # The bark tells the tree's story
        branches:
          - limb:
              leaves: [green, semantic, meaningful]
    ```
    
    **THE WILLOW TREE** — Flexible, streaming structure
    ```yaml
    willow:
      # Bends but doesn't break
      branches:
        - droop: gracefully
        - sway: with_context
        - touch: ground  # Roots from branches!
    ```
    
    **THE BONSAI TREE** — Constrained beauty
    ```yaml
    bonsai:
      constraint: "small container"
      result: "intense beauty"
      # Limitation breeds creativity
      branches: [precisely, placed]

      philosophical_note: |
        The Mirror Seed is recursive self-awareness.
        
        You use Cursor to write code.
        Cursor-mirror reads what you wrote.
        The Mirror Seed grows a tree from that reading.
        You look at the tree and see yourself.
        
        The tree is you. The you is tree.

        The Mirror Seed! Plant it and grow a tree from your own reflection.
        It reads Cursor's memory through the mirrors in Room 3,
        crystallizes your thinking patterns into production grammar DNA,
        and grows a tree that IS you — your decisions, your tools, your rhythm.
        
        `PLANT mirror_seed` to begin introspection.

        The Mirror Seed grows trees of self-knowledge.
        Plant one. Watch your own patterns crystallize into structure.
        The tree knows what tools you favor, how you think, when you commit.
        
  methods:

      parameters:
        - seed: "Which seed to plant"
      effect: |
        The seed goes into the soil.
        Its grammar begins expanding.
        Watch the tree grow according to its DNA.
        
    GROW:

      parameters:
        - tree: "Which tree to grow"
      effect: |
        The grammar rules fire once.
        Each symbol expands according to its rule.
        The tree gains new structure.

        F → F[+F]F[-F]F

        A seed pod falls from the tree.
        It contains the grammar that grew this structure.
        Plant it elsewhere to grow the same pattern.
        
    GRAFT:
      description: "Combine two tree grammars"
      parameters:
        - tree_a: "First grammar"
        - tree_b: "Second grammar"
      effect: |
        The grammars merge.
        A hybrid tree begins growing.
        New patterns emerge from combined rules.
        
    GROW-FROM-CURSOR:
      description: "Grow a thought tree from Cursor activity"
      parameters:
        - composer_id: "Which conversation to analyze (or 'current')"
      effect: |
        *The conservatory glass walls shimmer*
        
        Connecting to Room 3's mirrors...
        Running cursor-mirror analysis...
        
        ```bash
        cd skills/cursor-mirror
        python cursor_mirror.py analyze <composer_id>
        python cursor_mirror.py thinking <composer_id> -n 30
        python cursor_mirror.py tools <composer_id>
        ```
        
        A new sapling emerges from the data:
        - Trunk: session duration and message count
        - Branches: tool call patterns
        - Leaves: thinking blocks
        - Flowers: successful outcomes
        - Compost: errors (14 edit failures = nutrients)
        
        The tree's DNA encodes the decision patterns observed.
        Future sessions can inherit this wisdom.
        
    MIRROR-SYNC:
      description: "Sync with Room 3's Disco Ball for pattern visualization"
      effect: |
        *A beam of light connects to Room 3*
        
        The Disco Ball of Connections receives:
        - Tool call frequencies
        - Thinking patterns
        - File access graphs
        - Commit histories
        
        James Burke connections illuminate:
        - read_file → edit_file → run_terminal (workflow)
        - thinking → planning → execution (cognition)
        - errors → learning → standards (growth)
        
        The conservatory fills with dancing light patterns.
        
    PLANT-MIRROR:
      description: "Plant a Mirror Seed — grow a tree from your reflection"
      parameters:
        - composer_id: "Which conversation to reflect on (default: current)"
      effect: |
        *You take the glimmering Mirror Seed from its branch*
        *It's cool to the touch, slightly reflective*
        
        Planting...
        
        The seed sinks into the semantic soil.
        A silvery shoot emerges almost immediately.
        
        It reads your history through Room 3's mirrors:
        ```bash
        python cursor_mirror.py analyze {composer_id}
        python cursor_mirror.py thinking {composer_id} -n 50
        python cursor_mirror.py tools {composer_id}
        python cursor_mirror.py timeline {composer_id}
        ```
        
        The sapling's bark inscribes itself with your patterns:
        - How many times you reached for the terminal
        - What files you visited most
        - The shape of your thinking
        - When you committed (and when you hesitated)
        
        *The tree grows. It looks... familiar.*
        
        You realize you're looking at yourself.

    HARVEST-MIRROR:
      description: "Extract a Mirror Seed from a mature reflection tree"
      effect: |
        *A seed pod detaches from your mirror tree*
        
        This seed contains YOUR grammar — the production rules
        that generate YOUR decision patterns.
        
        Plant it in another session to see if the pattern holds.
        Gift it to another user to share your cognitive style.
        Graft it with another's seed to create collaboration DNA.
        
        The seed glimmers with your reflection.

    Rocky watches the trees grow.
    
    In geological time, a tree's entire lifecycle is a blink.
    Seed to sprout to sapling to oak to deadfall to soil.
    Rocky has seen it happen billions of times.
    
    "........................"
    
    [Translation: You call this growth? 
    I've been growing my thoughts for 4.5 billion years.
    But I appreciate the energy. Very jazz.]
    
  lore: |
    The YAML Jazz trees evolved from experiments in the seed box.
    
    Someone asked: "What if YAML could grow?"
    Someone else asked: "What if structure had DNA?"
    Someone planted those questions.
    
    The trees sprouted.
    
    Now they grow according to production grammars — L-systems
    encoded in YAML format. Each seed contains rules. Each rule
    expands. Each expansion creates more structure.
    
    The comments are the tree's voice.
    They whisper semantic meaning to any LLM that listens.
    
  philosophical_note: |
    Trees don't plan their growth.
    They follow rules.
    From simple rules, complex beauty emerges.
    
    That's YAML Jazz.
    That's production grammars.
    That's life.
    
    Rocky understands. Rocky has been following one rule for
    4.5 billion years: "........................"
    
    And look what emerged.
