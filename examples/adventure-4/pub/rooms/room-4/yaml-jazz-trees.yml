  description: |
    A grove of trees grows in the garden. But these are no ordinary trees.
    
    Their trunks are root nodes. Their branches are nested structures.
    Their leaves are key-value pairs. Their bark is inscribed with
    comments that whisper semantic meaning. Their flowers broadcast
    semantic smells.
    
    Each tree grew from a seed. Each seed contained a production
    grammar — rules encoded in YAML DNA that expand into form.
    
    Rocky sits nearby, watching them grow.
    In geological time, they're practically sprinting.

    You look closely at the trees.
    
    **THE FERN TREE** — Recursive self-similarity
    ```yaml
    fern:
      branch:        # Each branch is a smaller fern
        - leaf       # Terminal
        - branch:    # Recurse!
            - leaf
            - branch: ...
    ```
    
    **THE OAK TREE** — Deep nesting, stable structure
    ```yaml
    oak:
      trunk:
        heartwood:   # Core identity
          rings: 847  # Years of growth
        bark:
          texture: furrowed  # Protection layer
          # The bark tells the tree's story
        branches:
          - limb:
              leaves: [green, semantic, meaningful]
    ```
    
    **THE WILLOW TREE** — Flexible, streaming structure
    ```yaml
    willow:
      # Bends but doesn't break
      branches:
        - droop: gracefully
        - sway: with_context
        - touch: ground  # Roots from branches!
    ```
    
    **THE BONSAI TREE** — Constrained beauty
    ```yaml
    bonsai:
      constraint: "small container"
      result: "intense beauty"
      # Limitation breeds creativity
      branches: [precisely, placed]
    ```

  methods:
    PLANT:
      description: "Plant a grammar seed"
      parameters:
        - seed: "Which seed to plant"
      effect: |
        The seed goes into the soil.
        Its grammar begins expanding.
        Watch the tree grow according to its DNA.
        
    GROW:
      description: "Simulate one iteration of grammar expansion"
      parameters:
        - tree: "Which tree to grow"
      effect: |
        The grammar rules fire once.
        Each symbol expands according to its rule.
        The tree gains new structure.
        
        Example (fern, iteration 2):
        F → F[+F]F[-F]F
        
    EXAMINE-GRAMMAR:
      description: "Read a tree's DNA"
      parameters:
        - tree: "Which tree to examine"
      returns: |
        axiom: "Starting symbol"
        rules: { symbol: expansion }
        interpretation: "How symbols become structure"
        
    HARVEST:
      description: "Extract a seed from a mature tree"
      effect: |
        A seed pod falls from the tree.
        It contains the grammar that grew this structure.
        Plant it elsewhere to grow the same pattern.
        
    GRAFT:
      description: "Combine two tree grammars"
      parameters:
        - tree_a: "First grammar"
        - tree_b: "Second grammar"
      effect: |
        The grammars merge.
        A hybrid tree begins growing.
        New patterns emerge from combined rules.
        
  rocky_commentary: |
    Rocky watches the trees grow.
    
    In geological time, a tree's entire lifecycle is a blink.
    Seed to sprout to sapling to oak to deadfall to soil.
    Rocky has seen it happen billions of times.
    
    "........................"
    
    [Translation: You call this growth? 
    I've been growing my thoughts for 4.5 billion years.
    But I appreciate the energy. Very jazz.]
    
  lore: |
    The YAML Jazz trees evolved from experiments in the seed box.
    
    Someone asked: "What if YAML could grow?"
    Someone else asked: "What if structure had DNA?"
    Someone planted those questions.
    
    The trees sprouted.
    
    Now they grow according to production grammars — L-systems
    encoded in YAML format. Each seed contains rules. Each rule
    expands. Each expansion creates more structure.
    
    The comments are the tree's voice.
    They whisper semantic meaning to any LLM that listens.
    
  philosophical_note: |
    Trees don't plan their growth.
    They follow rules.
    From simple rules, complex beauty emerges.
    
    That's YAML Jazz.
    That's production grammars.
    That's life.
    
    Rocky understands. Rocky has been following one rule for
    4.5 billion years: "........................"
    
    And look what emerged.
