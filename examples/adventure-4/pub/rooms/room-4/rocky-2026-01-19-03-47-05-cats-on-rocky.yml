  PHOTOREALISTIC. A magnificent glass conservatory flooded with gorgeous vivid sunlight streaming through tall Victorian windows. Lush tropical vegetation — orchids, ferns, palms — creating a jungle paradise.
  
  CENTER: A large, smooth, sun-warmed granite boulder (Rocky) sits on a bed of soft moss.
  
  THE CATS (10 total, doing cat things):
  
  ADULT CATS:
  - TERPIE: A beautiful calico cat stretched out luxuriously on top of Rocky, soaking up the warmth, eyes half-closed in bliss
  - STROOPWAFEL: A ginger tabby rubbing their cheek against Rocky's side, marking territory, tail up with happiness
  
  KITTENS (8 tiny fuzzballs, various colors, all being chaotic):
  - One kitten batting at a fern frond that brushes Rocky's surface
  - Two kittens wrestling playfully on Rocky's mossy base
  - One kitten perched on Rocky's highest point, surveying the kingdom
  - One kitten sniffing curiously at Rocky's mica sparkles
  - One kitten stretching claws against Rocky's rough side (scratching post!)
  - One kitten curled in a perfect circle in a moss patch near Rocky
  - One kitten mid-pounce, attacking a sunbeam on Rocky's surface
  
  DETAILS:
  - Cats in various poses: stretching, grooming, playing, napping, exploring
  - Fur catching the golden sunlight, whiskers glowing
  - Some kittens are tabby, some calico, some solid colors
  - Rocky is patient, warm, utterly unbothered — the ultimate cat furniture
  
  SETTING:
  - Victorian glass conservatory, ornate iron framework
  - Streaming golden sunlight with visible dust motes and god rays
  - Lush orchids in bloom — purple, white, coral
  - Ferns, palms, moss, trailing vines
  - Warm, dappled light patterns on everything
  
  MOOD: Warm, playful, peaceful. A sun-drenched sanctuary where cats have claimed the ancient boulder as their throne.
  
  STYLE: National Geographic meets Dutch Golden Age still life. Hyperrealistic fur textures, exquisite lighting, every whisker visible. 8K detail.
