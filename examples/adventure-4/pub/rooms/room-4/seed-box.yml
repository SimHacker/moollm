# 🌱 SEED BOX
# Where ideas begin — pure PLAY, no judgment

object:
  name: Seed Box
  type: artifact
  portable: true
  
  description: |
    A wooden box filled with seed packets of every variety. Some
    are labeled clearly ("TOMATO", "BASIL"). Others have cryptic
    notes ("THAT WEIRD THING FROM THE DREAM").
    
    A sign reads: "PLANT FREELY. MOST WILL FAIL. THAT'S THE POINT."
    
  examine: |
    The seeds are organized by type:
    
    KNOWN VARIETIES — Proven ideas:
      - "Web scraper" (reliable, boring)
      - "REST API" (grows anywhere)
      - "Config file" (low maintenance)
      
    EXPERIMENTAL — Might work:
      - "LLM as game master" (promising!)
      - "YAML with soul" (weird but interesting)
      - "Characters as interfaces" (novel)
      
    WILD — No idea if viable:
      - "Emoji fordite layers"
      - "Monkey beats game designer"
      - "Tool that inspects itself"
      
    The wild section has the most empty slots. Those seeds got planted.
    
  state:
    seeds_available: 47
    recently_planted: ["cursor-mirror", "I-Beam", "worm-confetti-crawler"]
    germination_rate: "12%"

  methods:
    PLANT:

      parameters:
        - idea: "What to try"
      effect: |
        The seed goes into the PLAY bed.
        No evaluation. No planning. Just planting.
        Check back later to see if it sprouted.
        
    SCATTER:
      description: "Plant many seeds at once"
      parameters:
        - count: "How many random ideas to generate"
      returns: "A handful of possibilities, unfiltered"
      
    CHECK:
      description: "See which recent plantings sprouted"
      returns: |
        Sprouted: [ideas that showed promise]
        Still dormant: [ideas that haven't moved]
        Composted: [ideas that died — nutrients for others]
        
  lore: |
    The seed box was a gift from a guest who was a jazz musician.
    
    "In jazz," she said, "you play a hundred wrong notes to find
    the one that changes everything. This box is for wrong notes."
    
  insight: |
    PLAY is the first stage of play-learn-lift:
    - No judgment
    - No planning
    - Just generation
    
    Most seeds fail. That's not waste — that's selection pressure.
    The survivors are the ideas worth developing.
