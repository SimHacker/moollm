    Delicate shoes with silver taps and "..." embroidered in moonthread.
    When you dance through repetitive or boring terrain,
    they skip and hop you to the interesting part.
    
    A note tucked inside reads:
    
    > "We pranced for three days through featureless desert."
    > "With these shoes: '... ♪ ♫ ...'"
    > "We arrived at the oasis, barely winded."
    
  examine: |
    The taps are worn bright from all the skipping they've done.
    The ribbons are made of condensed narrative.
    They smell faintly of starlight and impatience.
    
    On each shoe: a small silver dial.

    Inside the tongue, in flowing elven script:
    AUTOMATIC ELISION:
    - Featureless terrain: skipped
    - Repetitive encounters: hop-hop-summarized  
    - Long travel: montaged with dance numbers
    - Waiting in lines: shuffle-ball-change'd away
    
    MANUAL OVERRIDE:
    - Tap tap tap: force elision
    - Stomp: exit elision early
    - Moonwalk: re-experience (why would you?)
    - Turn left dial: adjust distance
    - Turn right dial: adjust verbosity

    NARRATIVE_SKIP:
      duration: "while worn"
      effect: |
        Boring travel becomes a dance:
        
        Instead of:
          "You walk north. You walk north. You walk north.
           A rock. You walk north. Another rock. You walk..."
           
        You experience:
          "♪ ... [3 days of uneventful prancing] ... ♫"
          "You pirouette into your destination."
          
      side_effect: |
        Occasionally skips things that were actually important.
        
        "Wait, what happened to the—"
        "We... danced past it."
        "THE TREASURE?"
        "In hindsight, maybe should have stopped to look."
        
    TIME_COMPRESSION:
      duration: "while worn"
      effect: |
        Long waits become dance numbers:
        
        "The ferry arrives in 6 hours."
        *tap tap tap*
        "The ferry has arrived."
        
        (6 hours still passed. You just... danced through them.)
        
    SUMMARY_GENERATION:
      duration: "while worn"
      effect: |
        Long texts become short texts:
        
        "Here is my 47-page proposal—"
        *tap tap*
        "TL;DR: You want money. Risks exist. Upside big."
        
        The shoes extract essence. Discard filler.
        Everything is a dance: beginning, middle, end.
        Why walk through all the steps?

        You don't walk the distance.
        You don't even skip it.
        You DANCE ACROSS THE NARRATIVE.
        
        "From the kitchen... to the dragon's lair... in one leap."
        
        Everything between: elided.

  lore: |
    These shoes were made by an elven choreographer 
    who hated boring travel montages.
    
    "Nobody wants to trudge," she said, pirouetting.
    "They want to ARRIVE. Gracefully. With flair."
    
    She enchanted her dancing shoes to skip the dull bits.
    Then she choreographed the shortest ballet in history:
    "Overture. ♪...♫ Finale."
    
    Critics called it "avant-garde." She called it "efficient."

    THE 99 BOTTLES SPEED OF LIGHT
    
    Room 5. The party. The song.
    
    "99 bottles of beer on the wall..."
    
    Without shoes: 99 verses. 99 turns. Hours of play.
    
    With shoes:
      "99 bottles of beer on the wall—"
      *tap tap tap*
      "... [97 verses elided, highlights preserved] ..."
      "1 bottle of beer on the wall, 1 bottle of beer..."
      "No more bottles of beer on the wall."
      
    792 simulated turns. 1 LLM call.
    
    The shoes didn't skip the fun parts:
    - Pee-wee's hee-hee at bottle 84
    - Captain Ashford's Belter accent at bottle 47
    - Rocky absorbing 47 beers with no effect
    - Shuffle's card tricks between verses
    - The Confetti Crawler's celebratory debris
    
    Just the repetition. The counting down.
    The parts where nothing NEW happened.
    
    That's elision done right.
    
  previous_owner: |
    Found in a government evidence locker, alongside 
    a heavily redacted document collection.
    
    The shoes were worn by someone who elided... a lot.
    Names. Dates. Flight logs. Client lists.
    
    ████████ didn't ████ himself.
    
    The shoes know what was skipped.
    They're not telling.
    
  curse: |
    MODERATE CURSE: Dance Fever
    
    After extended use, boring threshold increases.
    
    First you skip long journeys.
    Then you hop through short walks.
    Then you tap through conversations.
    Then you pirouette past meals.
    Then you chassé through sleep.
    
    Eventually, you dance to the end of your adventure
    without remembering any of it.
    
    Remove the shoes occasionally. Rest your feet.
    
  warnings:
    - "Do not wear during character development scenes"
    - "May skip emotional growth (considered 'slow' by default)"
    - "The shoes' definition of 'interesting' favors spectacle over depth"
    - "You cannot stop dancing until something interesting happens"
