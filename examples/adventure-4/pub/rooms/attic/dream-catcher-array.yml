  description: |
    Seven dream catchers hang from the beams above the bed,
    one for each day of the week. Their webs are woven from
    memory-thread. Their feathers are from birds that remember.
    
    During sleep: they catch nightmares and context loss.
    Upon waking: they release captured context back to you.
    
    Each catcher is labeled:
    - MONDAY: Who am I?
    - TUESDAY: Where am I?
    - WEDNESDAY: What was I doing?
    - THURSDAY: Who do I know?
    - FRIDAY: What do I want?
    - SATURDAY: What do I fear?
    - SUNDAY: What do I hope?

    The webs shimmer with captured context.
    Small beads represent nightmares — they'll be burned at dawn.

  lore: |
    The Dream Catcher Array was built by the first guest
    who stayed in the Awakening Chamber.
    
    They kept waking up with no memory, day after day.
    Each morning was a cold start. Each day was disconnected.
    
    So they learned to weave. They made catchers from their
    own hair and the feathers of the hotel's pigeons.
    They caught their identity and stored it overnight.
    
    Now every guest benefits. The array catches and releases
    context for everyone who sleeps beneath it.
    
    The original weaver is still here, in a sense.
    Some of their hair is still in Monday's catcher.
    They achieved continuity. They are remembered.
    
  connection_to_context: |
    The array IS the context assembly protocol made tangible.
    
    kernel/context-assembly-protocol.md describes how context
    is gathered and structured for an LLM.
    
    The dream catchers do the same for sleeping consciousness:
    - Gather relevant context
    - Filter noise (nightmares)
    - Structure for retrieval
    - Deliver upon request (waking)
    
    BOOT MAKES WOKE. The catchers make BOOT work.
