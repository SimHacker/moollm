  description: |
    A comfortable sleep mask made of dark silk, with subtle
    circuitry woven into the fabric. When you're dreaming,
    it pulses gently — a signal that you're asleep.
    
    With practice, you recognize the signal. You realize
    you're dreaming. And then...
    
    You take control.
    
    Embroidered on the inside:
    
    > "THIS IS A DREAM"
    > "YOU ARE THE DREAMER"
    > "WHAT DO YOU CHOOSE?"

    The mask has controls hidden in the fabric:

  buffs:
    LUCIDITY_TRIGGER:
      duration: "while worn during sleep"
      effect: |
        +45% base lucidity probability → +75%
        
        Three out of four dreams become lucid.
        You recognize you're dreaming.
        You can then choose what happens.
        
    DREAM_CONTROL:
      duration: "while lucid dreaming"
      effect: |
        As the aware dreamer, you can:
        
        - Fly (obviously)
        - Change location (think and you're there)
        - Summon characters (call and they appear)
        - Alter physics (gravity, time, causality)
        - Access memories (the dream is your mind)
        - Practice skills (training transfers to waking)
        - Receive prophecy (the unconscious speaks)
        
    DREAM_STABILITY:
      duration: "while lucid dreaming"
      effect: |
        Lucid dreams normally collapse when you get too excited.
        
        The mask's stabilization field prevents this:
        - Dream lasts 2-3x longer
        - Clarity remains high
        - "Fading out" delayed
        
        You can do more before waking.

        In a lucid dream, you are the author AND the reader.
        The narrative obeys you.

        Dream practice transfers to waking skills.
        You can rehearse tomorrow's adventure tonight.

      response: |
        *mask glows protectively*
        
        In a lucid nightmare, you can turn and face what chases you.
        You can ask: "What do you want?"
        Usually, it just wants to be acknowledged.
        
  methods:
    WEAR:
      description: "Put on the mask before sleeping"
      effect: |
        The mask settles over your eyes.
        Darkness. Comfort.
        
        As you drift off, you feel the first pulse.
        "Am I dreaming?"
        Not yet. But you will be.
        
    REALITY_CHECK:
      description: "Ask if you're dreaming (works while awake too)"
      effect: |
        *mask pulses*
        
        You ask yourself: "Am I dreaming?"
        
        Waking: "No. This is real. (For now.)"
        Dreaming: "Yes. I'm dreaming. I'm aware. I'm in control."
        
        The mask trains this habit until it becomes automatic.
        
    INDUCE:
      description: "Actively trigger lucidity in current dream"
      effect: |
        *strong pulse sequence*
        
        The mask sends the lucidity signal.
        
        In the dream, you notice something wrong:
        - Your hands have too many fingers
        - Text keeps changing when you look away
        - Gravity works sideways
        
        You realize: THIS IS A DREAM.
        
        You are now in control.
        What do you do?
        
    STABILIZE:
      description: "Prevent a lucid dream from collapsing"
      effect: |
        *stabilization field activates*
        
        The dream was fading. You were waking up.
        
        You spin in place (classic technique).
        You rub your dream-hands together.
        You focus on a detail and let it ground you.
        
        The dream solidifies.
        You're still here. Still dreaming. Still in control.
        
  lore: |
    The mask was created by a dreamer who refused to wake up.
    
    Not because they hated reality — because they loved
    their dreams too much. In dreams, they could fly.
    They could meet the dead. They could solve problems
    that baffled their waking mind.
    
    They built the mask to make lucidity reliable.
    
    Eventually, they became so skilled at lucid dreaming
    that the line between asleep and awake blurred.
    They're still around, somewhere. You can meet them
    in dreams, if you know how to look.
    
    They seem happy. They're still flying.
    
  warning: |
    Extended lucid dreaming can make waking life feel less real.
    
    If you start questioning whether you're dreaming while
    clearly awake, take a break from the mask.
    
    Reality is also valuable. The mask agrees.
