# 👹 ACME MONSTER MANUAL
# "Every Monster Guaranteed!*"
# *Guarantee does not cover: summoning gone wrong, monster loyalty,
# accidental befriending, or the monster eating the summoner first.
#
# These are SEEDS and EXAMPLES. The DM can invent more ACME monsters
# on the fly, following the pattern: impressive stats, hidden weakness,
# significant backfire chance, ironic behavior when summoned.

  description: |
    A leather-bound tome, suspiciously sticky. The cover shows
    a wizard triumphantly standing over a cowering dragon.
    
    ...Wait. Is the wizard on fire in the next illustration?
    
    "SUMMON ANYTHING! CONTROL EVERYTHING!*"
    "Power At Your Fingertips!*"
    
    *Power may be briefly at your fingertips before relocating
    to the monster's stomach. Control is aspirational.
    
  examine: |
    You flip through the Monster Manual. Every page promises
    fearsome creatures at your command. Every page has
    suspicious claw marks and burn stains.
    
    The margins are full of handwritten notes:
    - "DO NOT SUMMON ON TUESDAYS"
    - "Bring extra pants"
    - "It can smell fear. And cheese."
    - "I regret everything"
    - "If reading this, I didn't make it. Avenge me."
    
    The wizard on the cover... his expression changes between
    pages. He looks increasingly concerned.

        You speak the incantation! Smoke billows!
        A shape emerges from the void...
        
        (DM rolls for backfire chance)
        
        On success: Monster appears and awaits command!
        On backfire: Monster appears and has... opinions.
        
    BIND:
      description: "Attempt to control a summoned monster"

        The theme determines the monster mix.
        The location determines the density.
        Your regrets determine your future.
        
      warning: |
        BULK SUMMONING has BULK CONSEQUENCES.
        Backfire chance applies to EACH monster.
        Themes may... drift.

      description: "Attempt to remove all monsters from an area"
      usage: "DEPOPULATE [location]"

    FIGHT:
      description: "Engage a monster in combat (improvised)"
      usage: "FIGHT [monster] / ATTACK [monster] / HIT [monster] WITH [thing]"
      effect: |
        Combat is fully improvised! No stats needed!
        
        The DM considers:
        - What are you fighting with?
        - What's the monster's hidden weakness?
        - How creative is your approach?
        - Is this dramatically appropriate?
        
        Then narrates the result. Violence ensues.
        
    FLEE:
      description: "Run away from a monster"
      usage: "FLEE / RUN / ESCAPE / NOPE"
      effect: |
        *You attempt to flee!*
        
        Success depends on:
        - Monster's speed vs yours
        - Available exits
        - Whether you trip on something ironic
        - Cartoon physics (faster if you don't look back)
        
    BEFRIEND:
      description: "Attempt to befriend a monster instead of fighting"
      usage: "BEFRIEND [monster] / TALK TO [monster] / OFFER [thing] TO [monster]"
      effect: |
        *You attempt diplomacy with a creature of darkness!*
        
        Success depends on:
        - Monster's hidden nature (listed in entry)
        - What you're offering
        - Whether you're sincere
        - Whether the monster is hungry
        
        Many monsters are lonely. Some just want respect.
        Some will eat you anyway. Worth a try.
        
  # COMBAT GUIDE
  # "Violence is Always an Option! (Not Always a Good One)"
  
  combat:
    philosophy: |
      Combat in the Monster Manual is IMPROVISED.
      No hit points. No initiative. No dice required.
      (Though dice are fun if you want them.)
      
      Instead: NARRATIVE COMBAT.
      
      The DM describes the fight.
      You describe your actions.
      Consequences emerge from the story.
      
    how_it_works: |
      ATTACKING A MONSTER:
      
      1. Describe what you do
         "I swing my sword at the dragon!"
         "I throw the ACME anvil at the ghost!"
         "I try to reason with the eldritch horror!"
         
      2. DM considers:
         - Monster's threat level (LOW to EXTREME)
         - Monster's hidden weakness (exploit for advantage)
         - Your approach (clever = better odds)
         - Dramatic timing (climactic moments favor heroes)
         
      3. DM narrates the result:
         - Clear hit: Monster is affected!
         - Glancing blow: Some effect, monster retaliates
         - Miss: You're now in trouble
         - Critical: Something dramatic happens
         - Fumble: Comedy ensues
         
    weapons_and_tools: |
      WHAT CAN YOU FIGHT WITH?
      
      Anything! This is improvised combat!
      
      CONVENTIONAL:
        Sword, axe, bow, magic wand, etc.
        Works as expected. Boring but reliable.
        
      ACME PRODUCTS:
        Use items from the ACME Catalog!
        Powerful but... you know. Backfire chance.
        
      ENVIRONMENT:
        Chandeliers, barrels, conveniently placed anvils.
        Bonus points for creativity.
        
      WORDS:
        Insults, compliments, true names, puns.
        Some monsters are vulnerable to sick burns.
        
      FRIENDSHIP:
        The ultimate weapon. See BEFRIEND action.
        Works more often than you'd think.
        
    monster_attacks: |
      WHEN MONSTERS FIGHT BACK:
      
      Monsters don't have stats. They have DESCRIPTIONS.
      
      A dragon's attack is "breathes fire."
      A ghost's attack is "chilling touch."
      A mind flayer's attack is "psychic criticism."
      
      DM describes the attack.
      You describe your defense.
      Narrative determines the outcome.
      
      GETTING HIT:
      - Minor hit: You're inconvenienced
      - Solid hit: You're hurt (describe how)
      - Major hit: You're in serious trouble
      - Devastating: Dramatic consequences
      
      There's no HP to track. Just the story of your wounds.
      "I'm limping now." "My arm is burned." "I can't unsee that."
      
    exploiting_weaknesses: |
      EVERY MONSTER HAS A HIDDEN WEAKNESS.
      
      It's listed in their entry. USE IT.
      
      Examples:
      - Dragon: "Allergic to its own smoke"
        → Make it sneeze! Smoke bomb! Pepper!
        
      - Ghost: "Gets depressed if ignored"
        → Just... don't acknowledge it. Walk past.
        
      - Skeleton: "Falls apart if startled"
        → BOO! (Seriously, that's it.)
        
      - Shoggoth: "Needs constant praise"
        → "You're doing GREAT, Shoggoth! Love your work!"
        
      - Lich: "Phylactery is always in an obvious place"
        → Look for the glowing thing. There's always one.
        
      Exploiting weakness = automatic advantage.
      Creative exploitation = possible instant win.
      
    dramatic_timing: |
      COMBAT FOLLOWS NARRATIVE LOGIC.
      
      Early in adventure: Monsters are threatening
      Mid adventure: Even fights
      Climax: Heroes start winning
      Darkest moment: Everything goes wrong (temporarily)
      Final confrontation: Epic
      
      The DM adjusts difficulty to serve the story.
      This isn't cheating. This is DRAMA.
      
    death_and_consequences: |
      CAN YOU DIE?
      
      In theory: Yes.
      In practice: Depends on the story.
      
      HEROIC DEATH: If it serves the narrative
      COMIC DEATH: If it's funny (you get better)
      DRAMATIC INJURY: More likely than death
      CARTOON LOGIC: You survive but with consequences
      
      The ACME Monster Manual follows cartoon physics.
      You can survive anything once.
      Twice is pushing it.
      
    group_combat: |
      FIGHTING WITH ALLIES:
      
      Each person describes their action.
      DM weaves them into one narrative.
      
      TEAMWORK BONUS:
      - Coordinated attacks: Better results
      - Combo moves: Very effective
      - One person exploits weakness while others attack: Devastating
      
      FRIENDLY FIRE:
      ACME products in group combat have...
      ...increased backfire radius.
      
    monster_morale: |
      MONSTERS CAN SURRENDER OR FLEE.
      
      They have hidden natures. They want things.
      
      A dragon who's losing might offer treasure.
      A ghost who's losing might offer information.
      A demon who's losing might offer a deal. (DON'T.)
      
      Victory doesn't require death.
      Sometimes the best win is a new ally.
      (Or at least a monster that owes you one.)
      
    sample_combat: |
      EXAMPLE: Fighting an ACME Dragon (Economy Size)
      
      PLAYER: "I throw my ACME Portable Hole at the dragon's feet!"
      
      DM: "The hole deploys! The dragon's left leg drops through—
      but the dragon beats its wings, hovering! It's angry now.
      Smoke billows from its nostrils. It's about to breathe fire!"
      
      PLAYER: "Wait — smoke! It's allergic to its own smoke!
      I grab the ACME Giant Fan from my pack!"
      
      DM: "You bought that? Bold. Roll for backfire... you're clear!
      The fan whirs to life, blowing the dragon's own smoke
      back into its face!"
      
      PLAYER: "Take THAT, Smokealot McBurnface!"
      
      DM: "The dragon sneezes violently — a massive ACHOO that
      sends it tumbling through its own Portable Hole! You hear
      a distant thud. And then, faintly: 'I demand union representation!'"
      
      PLAYER: "I close the hole."
      
      DM: "The dragon is defeated. But somewhere, in the void,
      it's filing a complaint."
      
    improvised_weapons_examples: |
      CREATIVE COMBAT IDEAS:
      
      🪑 FURNITURE
      "I hit the skeleton with a chair!"
      → Classic. Effective. The skeleton is now scattered.
      
      🎹 PIANO
      "I drop the ACME Grand Piano on the ogre!"
      → Dramatic. Musical. 45% chance it lands on YOU.
      
      📖 THIS BOOK
      "I read the monster's own entry at it!"
      → Meta. Confusing. Monster has existential crisis.
      
      🧀 CHEESE
      "I throw cheese at the grue!"
      → It can smell cheese. This is either genius or fatal.
      
      💬 INSULTS
      "I mock the demon's fashion sense!"
      → Demons are surprisingly vain. Roll for sick burn.
      
      🤗 HUGS
      "I hug the eldritch abomination!"
      → It... wasn't expecting that. Nobody ever hugs it.
      → 40% chance of weird friendship. 60% chance of dissolution.
      
      🎵 MUSIC
      "I play a lullaby for the zombie horde!"
      → Zombies don't sleep. But they might remember sleeping.
      → Surprisingly melancholy result.
