# 👹 ACME MONSTER MANUAL
# "Every Monster Guaranteed!*"
# *Guarantee does not cover: summoning gone wrong, monster loyalty,
# accidental befriending, or the monster eating the summoner first.
#
# These are SEEDS and EXAMPLES. The DM can invent more ACME monsters
# on the fly, following the pattern: impressive stats, hidden weakness,
# significant backfire chance, ironic behavior when summoned.

  description: |
    A leather-bound tome, suspiciously sticky. The cover shows
    a wizard triumphantly standing over a cowering dragon.
    
    ...Wait. Is the wizard on fire in the next illustration?
    
    "SUMMON ANYTHING! CONTROL EVERYTHING!*"
    "Power At Your Fingertips!*"
    
    *Power may be briefly at your fingertips before relocating
    to the monster's stomach. Control is aspirational.
    
  examine: |
    You flip through the Monster Manual. Every page promises
    fearsome creatures at your command. Every page has
    suspicious claw marks and burn stains.
    
    The margins are full of handwritten notes:
    - "DO NOT SUMMON ON TUESDAYS"
    - "Bring extra pants"
    - "It can smell fear. And cheese."
    - "I regret everything"
    - "If reading this, I didn't make it. Avenge me."
    
    The wizard on the cover... his expression changes between
    pages. He looks increasingly concerned.

      All monsters want something:
      - Gold (dragons, imps)
      - Food (most things)
      - Entertainment (tricksters)
      - Understanding (eldritch)
      - Respect (constructs)
      - To be left alone (undead)
      
      Offering what they want: +20% control chance
      Ignoring their needs: -20% control chance
