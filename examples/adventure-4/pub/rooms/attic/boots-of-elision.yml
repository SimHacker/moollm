  description: |
    Worn leather boots with "..." stitched along the sides.
    When you walk through repetitive or boring terrain,
    the boots skip you to the interesting part.
    
    A note tucked inside reads:
    
    > "We walked for three days through featureless desert."
    > "With these boots: '...'"
    > "We arrived at the oasis."
    
  examine: |
    The soles are worn smooth from all the walking they've skipped.
    The laces are made of condensed narrative.

    NARRATIVE_SKIP:
      duration: "while worn"
      effect: |
        Boring travel is elided:
        
        Instead of:
          "You walk north. You walk north. You walk north.
           A rock. You walk north. Another rock. You walk..."
           
        You experience:
          "... [3 days of uneventful travel] ..."
          "You arrive at your destination."
          
      side_effect: |
        Occasionally skips things that were actually important.
        
        "Wait, what happened to the—"
        "We... elided past it."
        "THE TREASURE?"
        "In hindsight, maybe should have stopped."
        
    TIME_COMPRESSION:
      duration: "while worn"
      effect: |
        Long waits become manageable:
        
        "The ferry arrives in 6 hours."
        *click heels*
        "The ferry has arrived."
        
        (6 hours still passed. You just... weren't bored.)

        They fit perfectly. (They always do.)
        
        Immediately, you sense the boots evaluating
        the interestingness of your surroundings.
        
        Current location: [INTERESTING]

  lore: |
    These boots were made by a bard who hated travel chapters.
    
    "Nobody wants to read about the journey," she said.
    "They want the destination. The battle. The kiss."
    
    She enchanted her boots to skip the boring bits.
    Then she wrote the shortest epic poem in history:
    "Hero. Quest. ... Win."
    
    Critics called it "bold." She called it "efficient."
    
  legendary_performance: |
    THE 99 BOTTLES SPEED OF LIGHT
    
    Room 5. The party. The song.
    
    "99 bottles of beer on the wall..."
    
    Without boots: 99 verses. 99 turns. Hours of play.
    
    With boots:
      "99 bottles of beer on the wall—"
      *click click click*
      "... [97 verses elided, highlights preserved] ..."
      "1 bottle of beer on the wall, 1 bottle of beer..."
      "No more bottles of beer on the wall."
      
    792 simulated turns. 1 LLM call.
    
    The boots didn't skip the fun parts:
    - Pee-wee's hee-hee at bottle 84
    - Captain Ashford's Belter accent at bottle 47
    - Rocky absorbing 47 beers with no effect
    - Shuffle's card tricks between verses
    - The Confetti Crawler's celebratory debris
    
    Just the repetition. The counting down.
    The parts where nothing NEW happened.
    
    That's elision done right.
    
  previous_owner: |
    Found in a government evidence locker, alongside 
    a heavily redacted document collection.
    
    The boots were worn by someone who elided... a lot.
    Names. Dates. Flight logs. Client lists.
    
    ████████ didn't ████ himself.
    
    The boots know what was skipped.
    They're not telling.
    
  curse: |
    MODERATE CURSE: Impatience Creep
    
    After extended use, boring threshold increases.
    
    First you skip long journeys.
    Then you skip short walks.
    Then you skip conversations.
    Then you skip meals.
    Then you skip sleep.
    
    Eventually, you skip to the end of your adventure.
    
    Remove the boots occasionally to recalibrate.
    
  warnings:
    - "Do not wear during character development scenes"
    - "May skip emotional growth (considered 'boring' by default)"
    - "The boots' definition of 'interesting' is not always yours"
