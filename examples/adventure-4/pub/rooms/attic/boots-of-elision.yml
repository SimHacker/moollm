  description: |
    Worn leather boots with "..." stitched along the sides.
    When you walk through repetitive or boring terrain,
    the boots skip you to the interesting part.
    
    A note tucked inside reads:
    
    > "We walked for three days through featureless desert."
    > "With these boots: '...'"
    > "We arrived at the oasis."
    
  examine: |
    The soles are worn smooth from all the walking they've skipped.
    The laces are made of condensed narrative.

      effect: |
        Boring travel is elided:
        
        Instead of:
          "You walk north. You walk north. You walk north.
           A rock. You walk north. Another rock. You walk..."
           
        You experience:
          "... [3 days of uneventful travel] ..."
          "You arrive at your destination."
          
      side_effect: |
        Occasionally skips things that were actually important.
        
        "Wait, what happened to the—"
        "We... elided past it."
        "THE TREASURE?"
        "In hindsight, maybe should have stopped."
        
    TIME_COMPRESSION:

      effect: |
        Long waits become manageable:
        
        "The ferry arrives in 6 hours."
        *click heels*
        "The ferry has arrived."
        
        (6 hours still passed. You just... weren't bored.)

  lore: |
    These boots were made by a bard who hated travel chapters.
    
    "Nobody wants to read about the journey," she said.
    "They want the destination. The battle. The kiss."
    
    She enchanted her boots to skip the boring bits.
    Then she wrote the shortest epic poem in history:
    "Hero. Quest. ... Win."
    
    Critics called it "bold." She called it "efficient."
    
  curse: |
    MODERATE CURSE: Impatience Creep
    
    After extended use, boring threshold increases.
    
    First you skip long journeys.
    Then you skip short walks.
    Then you skip conversations.
    Then you skip meals.
    Then you skip sleep.
    
    Eventually, you skip to the end of your adventure.
    
    Remove the boots occasionally to recalibrate.
    
  warnings:
    - "Do not wear during character development scenes"
    - "May skip emotional growth (considered 'boring' by default)"
    - "The boots' definition of 'interesting' is not always yours"
