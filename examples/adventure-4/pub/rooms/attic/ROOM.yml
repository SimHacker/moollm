    Dusty beams. Slanted ceiling. A round window facing the stars.
    
    The attic is crammed with old adventuring gear, forgotten artifacts,
    and things that previous guests left behind. Some are useful. Some
    are cursed. Some are both.
    
    Trunks and boxes are stacked haphazardly. Labels are faded.
    A brass sign hangs from a beam:
    
    > "ADVENTURER'S STORAGE"
    > "Take what you need. Leave what you find."
    > "No refunds. No returns. No guarantees."
    > "-ACME Attic Staging Service"
    
    A velvet cushion in the corner is empty — Rocky used to sit here.
    The impression remains. Geological patience leaves marks.
    
    Something glints from inside a trunk...
    
  ideal_guest: |
    Adventurers gearing up. Treasure hunters. Those who appreciate
    that the best equipment is often the weirdest. Characters who
    know that "cursed" just means "interesting side effects."

  lore: |
    The attic has been here longer than the hotel.
    
    Some say the hotel was built *around* the attic, which was already
    here, floating in conceptual space, waiting for a building to
    attach to.
    
    Items left here don't always stay where you put them. They migrate.
    They breed. Two deprecated APIs left alone too long will produce
    a compatibility shim.
    
    The round window shows different stars depending on who's looking.
    Rocky saw geological-time stars (red giants, slow and patient).
    Fast thinkers see quasars and pulsars.
    
    The velvet cushion still smells faintly of silicate.
