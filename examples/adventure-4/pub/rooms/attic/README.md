# 🕸️ The Attic — Adventurer's Storage

> *"Take what you need. Leave what you find."*
> *"Mind the edge cases."*

**Dusty boxes, forgotten treasures, weird buffs.**

## 🌅 Overview

A cramped, dusty attic with slanted ceilings and exposed beams. Cobwebs in the corners. That unmistakable attic smell of old wood, mothballs, and forgotten things.

Boxes and trunks stacked haphazardly. Old furniture draped in sheets. Things that didn't fit anywhere else ended up here.

A hatch in the ceiling leads to the rooftop.
A ladder in the floor leads down to the hotel landing.

## 💡 Atmosphere

Dusty. Cramped. Full of potential.

The kind of place where you find exactly what you need if you rummage long enough. Also spiders.

Light comes from the hatch above and cracks in the eaves. Dust motes float in the beams.
