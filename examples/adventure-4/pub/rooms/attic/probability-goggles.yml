# 🥽 PROBABILITY GOGGLES
# "See the likelihood of everything."

object:
  name: Probability Goggles
  type: wearable
  slot: eyes
  portable: true
  rarity: uncommon
  
  description: |
    Brass goggles with lenses that shimmer with percentages.
    When worn, you see probability overlays on everything:
    
    - 73% chance this door is locked
    - 12% chance that NPC is lying
    - 99.7% chance Rocky is still sitting
    - 0.3% chance Rocky moved (margin of error)
    
    A label inside reads: "HEISENBERG OPTICS — Est. 1927"
    
  examine: |
    The lenses are made of crystallized uncertainty.
    Each eye shows a slightly different probability —
    that's the confidence interval.
    
    Controls on the side:
    - LEFT DIAL: Adjust threshold (hide low probabilities)
    - RIGHT DIAL: Bayesian prior weight
    - BUTTON: Collapse waveform (observe to lock probability)
    
    Warning etched in tiny text:
    "Observing changes outcomes. Use responsibly."

      effect: |
        See probability overlays on:
        - Outcomes of actions (% success)
        - NPC intentions (% truthful, % hostile)
        - Hidden objects (% exists, % trap)
        - Environmental hazards (% dangerous)
      side_effect: |
        Occasionally see your own probability of success.
        This can be demoralizing or motivating.

        The world blooms with percentages.
        
        Every surface, every face, every decision point
        now has floating numbers beside it.
        
        It's overwhelming at first. Then it's indispensable.

      effect: |
        *click*
        
        You observe the outcome. The waveform collapses.
        The probability becomes certainty (or its opposite).
        
        Warning: This can't be undone. The universe commits.
        
  lore: |
    These goggles were owned by a gambler who won too often.
    
    They were banned from every casino on three continents
    before they "lost" the goggles in the hotel attic.
    
    (They didn't lose them. The goggles showed 87% probability
    that keeping them would end badly. The gambler listened.)
    
  curse: |
    MINOR CURSE: Probability Anxiety
    
    After wearing the goggles for extended periods, you start
    seeing probabilities even without them.
    
    "There's a 23% chance this bread is stale."
    "67% chance they didn't hear me say hi."
    "12% chance the sun rises tomorrow (just kidding, 100%)."
    
    Fades after a few hours of not wearing them.
