  description: |
    A tall wooden cabinet with countless sliding drawers, each one
    containing... another cabinet? No, each drawer IS an object,
    and opening it reveals its slots as smaller drawers.
    
    It's outliners all the way down.
    
    A brass plate reads:
    
    > "THE OUTLINER"
    > "Every object can be opened."
    > "Every slot can be examined."
    > "Every value can be changed."
    > "(Yes, while it's running.)"

    When you open an object's drawer, you see an Outliner view:

  how_it_works: |
    The Outliner was Self's primary development tool:
    
    1. OPEN any object to see its slots
    2. EDIT any slot by clicking [edit]
    3. EXPAND collections to see contents
    4. FOLLOW parent* links to see delegation
    5. VIEW code for method slots
    6. ADD new slots directly
    7. CHANGES HAPPEN LIVE — no save button!
    
    This was revolutionary in 1987. Most languages required:
    - Write code in text editor
    - Compile
    - Run
    - Find bug
    - Stop
    - Edit text
    - Compile again...
    
    In Self with Outliners:
    - Browse to the bug
    - Fix it
    - Continue running
    
  commands:
    OUTLINE:
      usage: "OUTLINE [object]"
      effect: "Open an outliner view on any object"
      
    EDIT:
      usage: "EDIT [slot] ON [object]"
      effect: "Modify a slot's value"
      
    ADD_SLOT:
      usage: "ADD SLOT [name] TO [object]"
      effect: "Create a new slot on an object"
      
    FOLLOW:
      usage: "FOLLOW [parent*]"
      effect: "Navigate to the parent object"
      
  philosophy: |
    The Outliner embodies Self's core belief:
    
    "The program is not TEXT. The program is OBJECTS."
    
    You don't edit source files. You manipulate living objects.
    The Outliner is your window into that living world.
    
    When you add a slot, it exists immediately.
    When you change code, it runs the new version.
    There is no distinction between "edit time" and "run time."
