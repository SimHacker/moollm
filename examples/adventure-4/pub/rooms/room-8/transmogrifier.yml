  description: |
    A large cardboard box with hand-drawn dials and buttons. 
    One side says "TRANSMOGRIFIER" in wobbly crayon letters.
    An arrow points to a dial labeled with various creatures.
    
    But look closer — this isn't just any cardboard box.
    
    It's connected to the Clone-O-Matic by a brass tube.
    A YAML export slot on one side. An import slot on the other.
    And inside? The Slot Inspector's monocle, mounted for precision editing.
    
    > "First, clone. Then, transform."
    > "The box doesn't create from nothing — it remixes what exists."

    The Transmogrifier is a TRANSFORMATION pipeline, not a creation device.
    It builds on the Clone-O-Matic's duplication:

  integration:
    clone_o_matic:
      role: "Duplication service"
      connection: "Brass pneumatic tube"
      protocol: |
        1. Transmogrifier requests clone from Clone-O-Matic
        2. Clone-O-Matic creates shallow or deep clone (configurable)
        3. Clone is delivered via tube into the box
        4. Transmogrifier takes over for editing
        
    slot_inspector:
      role: "Precision viewing during edits"

      effect: "Visual slot manipulation"
      
  philosophy: |
    The Transmogrifier embodies a key insight:
    
    **Transformation is just cloning + editing.**
    
    You don't create new things from nothing.
    You find something similar, copy it, then make it yours.
    
    This is how:
    - Characters evolve (clone, edit backstory)
    - Variants are made (clone, tweak properties)
    - NPCs become PCs (clone, add depth)
    - Ideas become implementations (clone template, fill in details)
    
    The cardboard box reminds us: the technology is simple.
    The magic is in knowing what to change.
    
  lore: |
    Calvin explained it to Hobbes once:
    
    "It's a transmogrifier. It transforms stuff."
    "What does it transform stuff into?"
    "Whatever you want! That's the point!"
    
    When this box arrived in Room 8, someone connected it
    to the Clone-O-Matic. Now it actually works — not through
    imagination, but through prototype inheritance.
    
    The crayon drawings are still there. They're important.
    They remind us that the best technology feels like play.
