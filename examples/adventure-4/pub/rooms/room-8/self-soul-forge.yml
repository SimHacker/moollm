    A glowing forge sits in the corner, but it doesn't smelt metal.
    It smelts *identity*. But not from templates — from PROTOTYPES.
    
    Above the forge, in brass letters:
    
      "NO CLASSES. JUST CLONES."
      — The Self Philosophy
      
    Characters don't instantiate from abstract blueprints.
    They CLONE from existing beings and diverge.
    
    A portrait hangs beside the forge:
    Dave Ungar, creator of Self (1987).
    Beneath it: "Objects all the way down."

    The forge glows with prototype-based warmth:

    DAVE UNGAR — Creator of Self
    ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    
    In 1987, Dave Ungar (with Randall B. Smith) created Self
    at Xerox PARC and Stanford. It asked: What if there were
    NO CLASSES? What if objects just cloned from other objects?
    
    SELF'S KEY IDEAS:
    
    1. PROTOTYPES, NOT CLASSES
       No abstract blueprints. Just concrete objects.
       To make a new thing, clone an existing thing.
       
    2. SLOTS, NOT INSTANCE VARIABLES
       Everything is a slot. Data and methods: same thing.
       "Behavior is just data that happens to be executable."
       
    3. DELEGATION, NOT INHERITANCE
       When an object doesn't have something, it asks its parent.
       Parent is just a slot pointing to another object.
       
    4. UNIFORMITY
       Everything is an object. Numbers, methods, the system itself.
       Objects all the way down.
       
    5. MORPHIC UI
       Self pioneered direct manipulation interfaces.
       Every object was visible, editable, alive.
       
    INFLUENCE:
      - JavaScript (prototypes, not classes)
      - NewtonScript (Apple Newton)
      - Lua (metatables)
      - Io language
      - MOOLLM (prototype composition!)
      
    "Self was not just a language. It was a way of thinking
    about objects as THINGS, not TYPES."

    ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    THE PUN: Soul <=> Self
    ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    
    In MOOLLM:
      - A CHARACTER.yml is called a "soul file"
      - Characters inherit from prototypes, not classes
      - Rocky.yml is a CONCRETE being, not an abstract Person class
      
    This IS the Self philosophy!
    
    When we say "forging a soul," we mean:
      - Clone from an existing prototype
      - Add/override slots (personality, methods, catchphrases)
      - The new being inherits what it doesn't override
      
    Soul file = Self object
    Forging = Cloning + customizing
    
    The room's name was always right.
    We just didn't know why.

  methods:
    CLONE:
      description: "Create a new being from an existing prototype"
      parameters:
        - prototype: "The being to clone from"
        - overrides: "What to change or add"
      effect: |
        1. Prototype examined (all slots visible)
        2. Clone created (inherits everything)
        3. Overrides applied (new/changed slots)
        4. Clone awakens (has its own identity now)
        
      example: |
        CLONE:
          prototype: Rocky.yml
          overrides:
            mood: festive
            catchphrases:
              - "Rock and roll!" (new)
              
        Result: Rocky-at-party.yml
          - Has all of Rocky's traits
          - But mood is festive
          - And has extra catchphrase
          
    DELEGATE:
      description: "Ask a prototype for something the clone doesn't have"
      effect: |
        When clone lacks a slot:
        1. Check clone's parent slot
        2. Ask parent for the missing slot
        3. If parent has it, use it
        4. If not, parent asks ITS parent
        5. Delegation chain continues upward
        
    DIVERGE:
      description: "Override an inherited slot with something new"
      parameters:
        - slot: "Which slot to override"
        - value: "New value"
      effect: |
        The clone now has its own version.
        Parent's version unchanged.
        Clone is becoming its own being.
        
    LINEAGE:
      description: "Show the prototype chain"
      parameters:
        - character: "Which character"
      returns: |
        character: [the being]
        └─ cloned from: [parent prototype]
           └─ cloned from: [grandparent]
              └─ ... (until root)
              
  moollm_application: |
    MOOLLM is prototype-based (whether it knows it or not):
    
    - Rocky.yml is not a "Rock class" — it's THE rock named Rocky
    - When we make a party version, we clone and override
    - CHARACTER.yml files ARE Self objects in YAML form
    - The "soul" is the Self
    
    YAML slots:
      name: Rocky           # data slot
      personality: [...]    # data slot  
      MEDITATE:             # method slot
        effect: "..."
        
    No distinction. Slots all the way down.
    Dave Ungar would approve.
    
  lore: |
    The forge was here before anyone understood why "soul" was
    the right word. Then someone read about Self, and the
    pun clicked into place.
    
    Soul files. Self objects.
    Same philosophy, different era.
    
    Dave Ungar showed that you don't need Platonic Forms.
    You just need ancestors. Everything is an example.
    
    "The map is not the territory.
    But in Self, there IS no map.
    Only territory."
    
  philosophical_note: |
    Classes are ABSTRACT.
    Prototypes are CONCRETE.
    
    A class says: "This is the form of a Chair."
    A prototype says: "Here is an actual chair. Clone it."
    
    Which feels more real?
    
    MOOLLM characters are not instantiated from Person.
    They are cloned from Rocky, from I-Beam, from Palm.
    Real beings, not abstract types.
    
    This is why it's called a Soul Forge.
    We're forging Selves.
