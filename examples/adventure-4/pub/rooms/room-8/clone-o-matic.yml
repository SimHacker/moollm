# 🧬 CLONE-O-MATIC
# "You don't instantiate. You clone."
# The Self way of creating new objects

object:
  name: Clone-O-Matic
  type: creation_device
  portable: false
  
  description: |
    A gleaming brass and chrome machine with a large glass chamber
    divided down the middle. On one side: the PROTOTYPE. On the other:
    empty space, waiting to become the CLONE.
    
    A dial reads: "SHALLOW" ←→ "DEEP"
    A lever reads: "PULL TO CLONE"
    A slot accepts prototype* references.
    
    Above it, in Self's signature font:
    
    > "Every object is an example.
    > Every clone is a fresh start.
    > There are no abstractions here."

  how_it_works: |
    1. INSERT a prototype into the left chamber
       (Any object can be a prototype — there's no special class)
       
    2. SET the depth dial:
       - SHALLOW: Clone just the object, parent* points to original
       - DEEP: Clone the entire delegation chain
       
    3. PULL the lever
       *whirrrr* *flash* *ding!*
       
    4. RETRIEVE your clone from the right chamber
       - It has its own slots
       - It can be modified independently
       - It remembers where it came from (parent*)
       
  clone_types:
    shallow:
      description: "Clone points to original as parent"
      effect: |
        clone.parent* = original
        clone.slots = {} (empty, inherits everything)
        Changes to original affect clone (delegation)
        
    deep:
      description: "Clone copies entire chain"
      effect: |
        clone.parent* = clone_of_original_parent
        clone.slots = copy(original.slots)
        Clone is independent (can still share deeper ancestors)
        
  philosophy: |
    In Self, there is no distinction between "class" and "instance."
    There are only OBJECTS — some of which serve as examples for others.
    
    The Clone-O-Matic makes this tangible:
    - No templates, no blueprints, no abstractions
    - Just real objects you can point to and say "make another like this"
    - The clone IS a real object, as real as its prototype
    
    This is how characters work in MOOLLM:
    - Want a new adventurer? Clone from an existing one.
    - Want a variant? Clone and modify.
    - Want to understand inheritance? Follow the parent* pointers.
    
  commands:
    CLONE:
      usage: "CLONE [object]"
      effect: "Create a shallow clone, parent* points to original"
      
    DEEP_CLONE:
      usage: "DEEP CLONE [object]"
      effect: "Create a deep clone, copying the entire chain"
      
    INSPECT:
      usage: "INSPECT [object]"
      effect: "See all slots and the parent* pointer"
