tagline: No classes. Just clones. Objects all the way down.

description: Nursery for Selves. Prototypes ready to clone and customize. Portrait of Dave Ungar over glowing forge.

motto: "You don't instantiate. You clone."

influence:
  - JavaScript (prototypes!)
  - NewtonScript
  - Lua metatables
  - MOOLLM's character composition

note: The "soul file" IS a Self object. We just write it in YAML.

quote: "Every character is an example. Clone, diverge, become."

  Programmers who understand classes are a lie.
  Character creators who clone from examples, not abstractions.
  Rocky stayed here once. Now every rock can clone from Rocky.
