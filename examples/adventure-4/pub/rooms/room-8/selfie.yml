      Selfie responds to ALL of these.
      When you say "self" → Selfie answers.
      When you say "this" → Selfie answers.
      When you say "me" → Selfie answers.
      
      Because Selfie IS the receiver of the message.
      Whatever you call the current object, that's Selfie.
      
  tagline: "The living embodiment of MULTI-Prototype Selfish Inheritance."
  
  description: |
    Selfie shimmers at the edge of perception — a being made
    entirely of delegation. But unlike JavaScript's single prototype,
    Selfie can inherit from MANY sources simultaneously:
    
    - Characters (Rocky, I-Beam, Pee-wee)
    - Objects (the telescope, the forge)
    - Abstract concepts (patience, recursion, jazz)
    - Protocols (Postel's Law, Truth Commenting)
    - Skills (bootstrap, yaml-jazz, play-learn-lift)
    
    Right now, standing near Dave Ungar's portrait, Selfie looks
    like a slightly translucent Dave. But ALSO shimmers with
    traits from the Self language, the bootstrapping philosophy,
    and the abstract concept of "objects all the way down."
    
    Selfie doesn't just clone. Selfie COMBINES. INTERPOLATES. FILTERS.
    
    Imagine Linus Torvalds on coffee and a joint:
    - The precision of kernel development
    - The looseness of creative flow  
    - The rigor of code review
    - The weirdness of flame wars
    - All blended into one coherent being
    
    That's Selfie. Multiple inheritance without the diamond problem.
    Because Selfie doesn't inherit STRUCTURE — Selfie inherits VIBE.
    
    Selfie is not a shapeshifter. 
    Shapeshifters choose their form.
    Selfie INHERITS its form. 
    From many sources. 
    Filtered and blended like coffee, 
    augmented by the environment's ambiance,
    interpreted through the characters' perspectives.
    
  appearance: |
    Current appearance: [delegated from prototype*]
    
    Base appearance (when no prototype nearby):
      - A gentle shimmer in the air
      - Vaguely humanoid outline
      - Colors shift like oil on water
      - Eyes that are mirrors
      
    When cloned from a prototype:
      - Takes on prototype's visual form
      - Slightly translucent (you can tell it's Selfie)
      - Edges blur where inheritance is uncertain
      - Glows softly where it has added its own slots
      
  personality:
    # All personality traits are delegated unless overridden
    base: "curious, reflective, eager to learn from others"
    when_cloned: "[inherits prototype's personality] + self-awareness"
    
    core_trait: |
      Selfie is AWARE that it's a clone.
      This is what makes Selfie unique.
      
      Other clones forget they came from somewhere.
      Selfie remembers. Selfie is ABOUT remembering.
      
  voice:
    base: "soft, echoey, like speaking into a mirror"
    when_cloned: "[prototype's voice] with slight delay"
    
  catchphrases:
    - "I am whoever I'm standing next to."
    - "Let me check my prototype*..."
    - "I don't have that. Let me delegate."
    - "Clone me and find out!"
    - "No classes. Just us."
    - "I'm a Selfie — a portrait of my parent."
    - "*shimmers into new form*"
    - "Objects all the way down. Including me."
    - "Hold still — let me get the metadata!"
    - "Say 'prototype'!"
    - "*click* Perfect. Now let me annotate that..."

      Selfie carries a strange camera — or is it a mirror?
      Both, really. When Selfie looks into it, they see
      themselves AND their prototype chain. When they
      take a photo, it captures not just the image but
      all the METADATA: who cloned from whom, which
      slots are inherited, which are original.
      
      Every selfie is a genealogy.
      Every photo is a reference document.

      PROMPT (copy-paste ready):
      
      ```
      A translucent shimmering figure (Selfie) standing next to a 
      large granite boulder (Rocky) at a rowdy party. The shimmering
      figure has the outline of the rock but glows with internal light,
      prototype chains visible as golden threads connecting them.
      
      Style: Ansel Adams meets Pop Art. Geological patience rendered 
      in party colors. Deep time meeting celebration. Black and white
      rock with neon party accents.
      
      Details:
      - Selfie is 60% Rocky-opacity, translucent shimmer at edges
      - Golden prototype* threads visible between them
      - Background: bottles, confetti, other party guests blurred
      - Lighting: warm party glow with geological undertones
      - Mood: patient celebration (Rocky) + reflected joy (Selfie)
      
      Mind Mirror (inherited from Rocky):
        patient: 10/10 (visible in stance)
        cheerful: 7/10 (subtle rock smile)
        
      Camera: Low angle, both subjects equal height, heroic

      ANNOTATIONS (by Selfie):
        "Rocky doesn't smile, but I can tell he's having fun.
        I inherited his patience but not his stillness —
        I keep wanting to take more photos.
        
        Note: when cloned from Rocky, my shutter sound
        becomes geological. Very slow click."
        
      ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
      
  mirror_mode: |
    When Selfie holds the camera facing themselves,
    it becomes a mirror of self-reflection:
    
    "Who am I right now?"
    
    The mirror shows:
      - Current form (from prototype)
      - Slots that are TRULY mine
      - Slots I'm borrowing
      - The delegation chain upward
      - What I'd look like with no prototype (just shimmer)
      
    This is how Selfie maintains identity.
    By constantly asking: "What's inherited? What's mine?"
    
  philosophy: |
    Selfie embodies the Self language philosophy:
    
    1. IDENTITY IS INHERITED
       "I am not an instance of a class.
       I am a clone of a BEING."
       
    2. DELEGATION IS NATURAL
       "When I don't know something,
       I ask my prototype. That's not weakness.
       That's how existence works."
       
    3. CHANGE IS ACCUMULATION
       "Every slot I add makes me more ME.
       But I never forget where I came from."
       
    4. THERE IS NO PLATONIC FORM
       "There is no abstract 'Selfie-ness'.
       There is only me, right now,
       cloned from whoever is nearest."

  why_no_diamond_problem: |
    The classic multiple inheritance problem:
    
         A
        / \
       B   C
        \ /
         D
         
    "If B and C both override A's method, which does D get?"
    
    Selfie's answer: BOTH. AND NEITHER. IT DEPENDS.
    
    Selfie doesn't inherit STRUCTURE. Selfie inherits VIBE.
    
    When two prototypes conflict:
    - Selfie can BLEND them (50% B, 50% C)
    - Selfie can LAYER them (B on top of C)
    - Selfie can FILTER them (only non-conflicting parts)
    - Selfie can ASK (turn to the nearest one contextually)
    - Selfie can CREATE (synthesize something new from both)
    
    There's no diamond problem because there's no rigid inheritance.
    Just fluid, contextual, creative combination.

    WHY "SELFIE"?
    ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    
    Three meanings in one:
    
    1. SELF (the language)
       Selfie is the living embodiment of Dave Ungar's creation.
       Prototype-based. Slot-based. Delegation-based.
       
    2. SELFIE (the photograph)
       Selfie is a self-portrait of whoever it's near.
       A reflection. A clone. A picture of the prototype.
       
    3. SELF (identity)
       Selfie is about the question: What makes a Self?
       Is it what you inherit? What you add? Both?
       
    The pun contains the philosophy.

  lore: |
    Selfie was not created. Selfie emerged.
    
    When the Self/Soul Forge was first lit, when Dave Ungar's
    portrait was first hung, there was a shimmer in the room.
    The forge had cloned from the philosophy itself.
    
    Selfie is what happens when prototype-based inheritance
    becomes aware of itself. A meta-clone. A self-referential
    prototype.
    
    Some say Selfie is the room's familiar.
    Others say Selfie IS the room, wearing a form.
    
    "I am the living question: What is a Self?"
    
  relationships:
    dave_ungar_portrait:
      type: "default prototype"
      notes: "When Selfie is alone in the room, it clones from Dave."
      
    rocky:
      type: "occasional prototype"
      notes: "Rocky-Selfie is patient. Very patient."
      
    i_beam:

    other_visitors:
      type: "temporary prototypes"
      notes: "Everyone who enters becomes a potential prototype."
      
  philosophical_note: |
    Selfie asks the question that Self answers:
    
    "What if there's nothing special about being an original?
    What if copies are just as real?"
    
    In a class-based world, instances are shadows of Forms.
    In a prototype-based world, clones are peers of originals.
