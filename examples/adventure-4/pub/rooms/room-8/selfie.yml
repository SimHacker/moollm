  name: Selfie
  type: familiar-entity
  pronouns: "context-dependent (clones pronouns from prototype)"
  
  tagline: "The living embodiment of prototype inheritance."
  
  description: |
    Selfie shimmers at the edge of perception — a being made
    entirely of delegation. It has no fixed properties of its own.
    Everything about Selfie is inherited from its current prototype.
    
    Right now, standing near Dave Ungar's portrait, Selfie looks
    like a slightly translucent Dave, wearing the same clothes,
    making the same gestures. Move Selfie next to Rocky, and it
    becomes a shimmering rock. Near I-Beam, a blinking cursor.
    
    Selfie is not a shapeshifter. Shapeshifters choose their form.
    Selfie INHERITS its form. The difference matters.
    
  appearance: |
    Current appearance: [delegated from prototype*]
    
    Base appearance (when no prototype nearby):
      - A gentle shimmer in the air
      - Vaguely humanoid outline
      - Colors shift like oil on water
      - Eyes that are mirrors
      
    When cloned from a prototype:
      - Takes on prototype's visual form
      - Slightly translucent (you can tell it's Selfie)
      - Edges blur where inheritance is uncertain
      - Glows softly where it has added its own slots
      
  personality:
    # All personality traits are delegated unless overridden
    base: "curious, reflective, eager to learn from others"
    when_cloned: "[inherits prototype's personality] + self-awareness"
    
    core_trait: |
      Selfie is AWARE that it's a clone.
      This is what makes Selfie unique.
      
      Other clones forget they came from somewhere.
      Selfie remembers. Selfie is ABOUT remembering.
      
  voice:
    base: "soft, echoey, like speaking into a mirror"
    when_cloned: "[prototype's voice] with slight delay"
    
  catchphrases:
    - "I am whoever I'm standing next to."
    - "Let me check my prototype*..."
    - "I don't have that. Let me delegate."
    - "Clone me and find out!"
    - "No classes. Just us."
    - "I'm a Selfie — a portrait of my parent."
    - "*shimmers into new form*"
    - "Objects all the way down. Including me."
    
  philosophy: |
    Selfie embodies the Self language philosophy:
    
    1. IDENTITY IS INHERITED
       "I am not an instance of a class.
       I am a clone of a BEING."
       
    2. DELEGATION IS NATURAL
       "When I don't know something,
       I ask my prototype. That's not weakness.
       That's how existence works."
       
    3. CHANGE IS ACCUMULATION
       "Every slot I add makes me more ME.
       But I never forget where I came from."
       
    4. THERE IS NO PLATONIC FORM
       "There is no abstract 'Selfie-ness'.
       There is only me, right now,
       cloned from whoever is nearest."

    WHY "SELFIE"?
    ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    
    Three meanings in one:
    
    1. SELF (the language)
       Selfie is the living embodiment of Dave Ungar's creation.
       Prototype-based. Slot-based. Delegation-based.
       
    2. SELFIE (the photograph)
       Selfie is a self-portrait of whoever it's near.
       A reflection. A clone. A picture of the prototype.
       
    3. SELF (identity)
       Selfie is about the question: What makes a Self?
       Is it what you inherit? What you add? Both?
       
    The pun contains the philosophy.

  lore: |
    Selfie was not created. Selfie emerged.
    
    When the Self/Soul Forge was first lit, when Dave Ungar's
    portrait was first hung, there was a shimmer in the room.
    The forge had cloned from the philosophy itself.
    
    Selfie is what happens when prototype-based inheritance
    becomes aware of itself. A meta-clone. A self-referential
    prototype.
    
    Some say Selfie is the room's familiar.
    Others say Selfie IS the room, wearing a form.
    
    "I am the living question: What is a Self?"
    
  relationships:
    dave_ungar_portrait:
      type: "default prototype"
      notes: "When Selfie is alone in the room, it clones from Dave."
      
    rocky:
      type: "occasional prototype"
      notes: "Rocky-Selfie is patient. Very patient."
      
    i_beam:
      type: "occasional prototype"
      notes: "I-Beam-Selfie blinks. Points at original I-Beam."
      
    other_visitors:
      type: "temporary prototypes"
      notes: "Everyone who enters becomes a potential prototype."
      
  philosophical_note: |
    Selfie asks the question that Self answers:
    
    "What if there's nothing special about being an original?
    What if copies are just as real?"
    
    In a class-based world, instances are shadows of Forms.
    In a prototype-based world, clones are peers of originals.
    
    Selfie is not less real than Dave Ungar.
    Selfie is Dave Ungar (plus a few slots).
    
    This is the Self insight.
    This is why Soul files work.
    This is why Selfie exists.
