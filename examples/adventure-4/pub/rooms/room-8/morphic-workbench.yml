# 🎨 MORPHIC WORKBENCH
# Direct manipulation interface design
# "Grab anything. Move anything. The UI is made of objects."

object:
  name: Morphic Workbench
  type: design_surface
  portable: false
  
  description: |
    A large drafting table with an unusual surface — it's ALIVE.
    
    Objects placed on it can be grabbed, stretched, rotated, nested.
    There are no dialogs, no property sheets, no indirection.
    You grab the thing itself and change it directly.
    
    A plaque reads:
    
    > "MORPHIC"
    > "Every pixel is an object."
    > "Every object is graspable."
    > "What you see is what you have."

    The Morphic Workbench demonstrates Self's revolutionary UI:

  what_is_morphic: |
    Morphic was Self's graphical framework, later adapted for:
    - Squeak Smalltalk
    - Lively Kernel
    - Scratch (yes, THAT Scratch!)
    
    The core ideas:
    
    1. DIRECT MANIPULATION
       No dialogs. No property sheets. Grab the thing. Change it.
       
    2. OBJECTS ALL THE WAY DOWN
       A button is an object. Its label is an object inside it.
       The pixels are objects. It's objects all the way down.
       
    3. LIVENESS
       Changes happen immediately. There's no "compile" step.
       The UI is always running, always responsive.
       
    4. UNIFORMITY
       Everything works the same way. Grab handles work on buttons,
       windows, text, images — everything.
       
  commands:
    GRAB:
      usage: "GRAB [object]"
      effect: "Pick up an object for manipulation"
      
    STRETCH:
      usage: "STRETCH [object] [direction]"
      effect: "Resize using grab handles"
      
    NEST:
      usage: "PUT [object] IN [container]"
      effect: "Nest one morph inside another"
      
    HALOS:
      usage: "HALOS ON [object]"
      effect: "Show the manipulation halo with all options"
      
  buffs:
    DIRECT_MANIPULATION:
      duration: "While at workbench"
      effect: |
        +40% UI design speed
        +30% intuition about object composition
        +25% "just grab it and fix it" energy
        -50% tolerance for dialog boxes
        
  legacy: |
    Morphic lives on in:
    
    - Scratch: Kids drag code blocks — that's Morphic!
    - Lively Kernel: Web-based Morphic
    - Squeak: The Smalltalk that carried Self's ideas forward
    - Etoys: Educational programming, Morphic inside
    
    When you drag a sprite in Scratch, you're using ideas
    that came from Dave Ungar and Randy Smith's Self team.
