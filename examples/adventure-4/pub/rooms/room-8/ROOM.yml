# Theme: Prototype-based character creation — Tribute to Dave Ungar

# Soul <=> Self
# The pun is the philosophy.

room:
  name: "The Self/Soul Suite"
  id: room-8
  number: 8
  theme: prototypes
  tribute_to: "Dave Ungar, creator of Self (1987)"
  
  tagline: "No classes. Just clones. Objects all the way down."
  
  description: |
    The room is a nursery for Selves. Not empty vessels waiting for
    templates — but PROTOTYPES ready to be cloned and customized.
    
    A portrait of Dave Ungar hangs over the glowing forge.
    Beneath it: "You don't instantiate. You clone."
    
    The walls are covered with character sheets, each one
    pointing to its parent with a slot labeled "prototype*".
    Inheritance is visible. Lineage is traceable.
    
    Above the bed:
    
    > "Every character is an example. Clone, diverge, become."
    
  namesake: |
    Dave Ungar created Self in 1987, asking: what if there were
    no classes? What if objects just cloned from other objects?
    
    Self influenced:
      - JavaScript (prototypes!)
      - NewtonScript
      - Lua metatables
      - MOOLLM's character composition
      
    The "soul file" IS a Self object.
    We just write it in YAML.
    
  ideal_guest: |
    Programmers who understand that classes are a lie.
    Character creators who clone from examples, not abstractions.
    Anyone who prefers "show me one" over "describe the category."
    
    Rocky stayed here once. Now every rock can clone from Rocky.

  atmosphere: |
    Warm, concrete, example-oriented.
    
    You don't feel like you're in a room of abstractions.
    You feel like you're in a room of BEINGS.
    Each one real. Each one clonable.
    
    The air hums with delegation.
    When something's missing, it asks upward.

  lore: |
    This room was originally called "The Incarnation Suite."
    Then someone noticed that "soul file" and "Self object"
    were the same thing — concrete beings, not abstract types.
    
    The name changed. The forge stayed.
    Dave Ungar's portrait went up.
    
    Now every character that's forged here knows:
    they come from someone, not something.
    Ancestors, not blueprints.
