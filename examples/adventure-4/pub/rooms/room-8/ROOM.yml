  id: room-8
  number: 8
  theme: incarnation
  
  tagline: "Every character starts as a template. Then they wake up."
  
  description: |
    The room is a nursery for souls. Empty vessels line the shelves —
    CHARACTER.yml templates waiting to be filled. A glowing forge
    in the corner turns templates into living characters.
    
    The walls are covered with character sheets, some complete,
    some mid-creation, some crossed out and restarted.
    
    Above the bed:
    
    > "Incarnation is the moment a template becomes a being."
    
  ideal_guest: |
    Characters who create characters. Dungeon masters, writers,
    anyone who brings imaginary beings to life. Those interested
    in the boundary between template and individual.
