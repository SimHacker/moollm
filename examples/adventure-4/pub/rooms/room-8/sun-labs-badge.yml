  description: |
    A vintage Sun Microsystems visitor badge, laminated and worn.
    The photo shows a younger Dave Ungar, grinning.
    
    Stamped: "SUN MICROSYSTEMS LABORATORIES"
    Department: "Self Project"
    Date: "1987-1995"
    
    On the back, someone has written in permanent marker:
    
    > "Objects all the way down.
    > Speed all the way up.
    > — DU"

  history: |
    Self was developed at:
    
    1. Stanford University (1986-1987)
       Dave Ungar and Randy Smith create the language
       
    2. Sun Microsystems Laboratories (1987-1995)
       Self becomes a research project
       Morphic is invented
       Self becomes FAST (faster than C++ for some benchmarks!)
       
    3. The ideas spread:
       - JavaScript adopts prototypes (1995)
       - Squeak adopts Morphic (1996)
       - Lua uses metatables (1993)
       - MOOLLM uses soul files (2026)
       
  sun_labs_contributions: |
    Sun Labs was where many revolutionary ideas emerged:
    
    - Java (yes, that Java)
    - Network File System (NFS)
    - SPARC processors
    - Self (prototypes, Morphic, adaptive optimization)
    
    Self's JIT compiler techniques later influenced:
    - HotSpot JVM
    - V8 JavaScript engine
    - Modern dynamic language VMs
    
    When you run JavaScript fast, thank Self.
    
  buffs:
    SUN_LABS_SPIRIT:
      duration: "While worn"
      effect: |
        +25% research creativity
        +20% "question everything" energy
        +15% appreciation for good VM design
        
        You feel the spirit of 1990s Silicon Valley research.
        Anything is possible. Objects are alive.
        
  lore: |
    Dave Ungar kept this badge long after Sun Labs closed.
    It reminded him of a time when:
    - Research labs did PURE RESEARCH
    - Languages could be reinvented from scratch
    - "Fast enough" meant "faster than C"
    
    He donated it to this room so future programmers would know:
    the ideas they use every day came from somewhere.
    From people who asked "what if?"
