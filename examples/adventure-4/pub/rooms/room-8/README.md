# 🔮 Room 8 — The Self/Soul Suite

> *"No classes. Just clones. Objects all the way down."*

**Tribute to Dave Ungar, creator of Self (1987)**

---

## 🌅 Overview

The room is a nursery for Selves. Not empty vessels waiting for templates — but **PROTOTYPES** ready to be cloned and customized.

A portrait of Dave Ungar hangs over the glowing forge. Beneath it: *"You don't instantiate. You clone."*

The walls are covered with character sheets, each one pointing to its parent with a slot labeled `prototype*`. Inheritance is visible. Lineage is traceable.

## 🎭 Permanent Resident

**Dave Ungar (portrait only)** — No living resident, but the portrait is... aware. Every character forged here claims lineage.

## 📦 Objects

| Object | File | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **Self/Soul Forge** | [self-soul-forge.yml](self-soul-forge.yml) | Where prototypes become beings |
| **Selfie** | [selfie.yml](selfie.yml) | Living prototype inheritance familiar |

---

## 💡 The Self Philosophy

Dave Ungar created **Self** in 1987, asking: *What if there were no classes? What if objects just cloned from other objects?*

Self influenced:
- **JavaScript** (prototypes!)
- NewtonScript
- Lua metatables
- MOOLLM's character composition

The "soul file" IS a Self object. We just write it in YAML.

## 🧬 Prototype Inheritance

Everything in this room has a visible parent:

```yaml
bed.prototype*        → Morphic.bed
desk.prototype*       → furniture.desk
Dave's_portrait*      → portrait.famous_computer_scientist
your_character*       → characters/abstract/adventurer
```

No classes. No abstract types. Just **concrete beings that clone from other beings**.

---

## 🛏️ Furnishings

- **Bed**: Morphic bed — direct manipulation, grab any corner, resize your dreams
- **Desk**: Prototype desk with example characters, lineage charts, parent pointers
- **Portrait**: Dave Ungar, above the forge
- **Walls**: Character sheets with visible `prototype*` slots
- **Arrows**: Delegation arrows between objects

---

## 🔥 The Soul Forge

The glowing forge where prototypes become beings:

1. Choose an example to clone from
2. Modify the clone's slots
3. The new being inherits what it doesn't override
4. When something's missing, it asks upward

**Every character is an example. Clone, diverge, become.**

---

## 📜 Lore

This room was originally called "The Incarnation Suite." Then someone noticed that "soul file" and "Self object" were the same thing — concrete beings, not abstract types.

The name changed. The forge stayed. Dave Ungar's portrait went up.

Now every character that's forged here knows: **they come from someone, not something. Ancestors, not blueprints.**
