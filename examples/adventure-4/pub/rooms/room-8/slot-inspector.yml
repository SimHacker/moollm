    A brass monocle on a chain, but the lens is... strange.
    It doesn't magnify. It REVEALS.
    
    Look at any object through this lens and you see its SLOTS:
    - Data slots (what it knows)
    - Method slots (what it can do)  
    - Parent slots (where it inherits from)
    
    The frame is inscribed:
    
    > "There is no distinction between code and data.
    > There are only slots."

  how_self_works: |
    In Self, EVERYTHING is a slot in an object:
    
    - Variables? Slots.
    - Methods? Slots (that contain code).
    - Inheritance? Slots (marked with * for parent delegation).
    
    When you send a message to an object:
    1. Check if it has a slot with that name
    2. If not, check parent* slots
    3. Keep going up until found or error
    
    This is DELEGATION, not inheritance.
    The parent isn't a template — it's a real object that answers for you.
    
  commands:
    INSPECT:

        +30% understanding of object structure
        +20% ability to find bugs

        You see the world as slots all the way down.
        
  lore: |
    Dave Ungar designed Self so that EVERYTHING was uniform:
    no special syntax for variables vs methods,
    no distinction between "class variables" and "instance variables."
    
    Just slots. Objects containing slots. 
    Some slots hold data. Some hold code. Some delegate to parents.
    
    The Slot Inspector reveals this beautiful simplicity.
