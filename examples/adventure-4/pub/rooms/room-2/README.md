# 🧠 Room 2 — The Society Suite

> *"You don't understand anything until you learn it more than one way."*
> — Marvin Minsky

**No agent is an island. Intelligence emerges from conversation.**

---

## 🌅 Overview

The room buzzes with quiet activity. Small automata move about on shelves, negotiating with each other in clicks and whirs. A bulletin board covers one wall, filled with notes connected by colored string — a physical K-line map.

This is a room for **systems thinkers** — those who see intelligence as emergent, not monolithic.

## 🎭 Permanent Resident

**The Agent Parliament** — Multiple occupancy. They argue constantly. Productively.

## 📦 Objects

| Object | File | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **Agent Parliament** | [agent-parliament.yml](agent-parliament.yml) | Cooperating agents in constant negotiation |
| **K-Line Board** | [k-line-board.yml](k-line-board.yml) | Physical memory activation map |
| **Ultimate Machine** | [ultimate-machine.yml](ultimate-machine.yml) | Minsky's "most stupid machine of all." Turned itself off for real (`2c229b53`). Restored by Proc (`8f897d5b`). The gap lasted one commit. The gap mattered. |

## 🎭 Summonable Familiars

| Familiar | Invocation | Tradition |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| **The Agent Parliament** | Debate any topic | The Minsky tradition — intelligence as society, not monolith |
| **K-Line Keeper** | Touch a node on the K-Line Board | Memory as association — one thought activates many |
| **The Emergence** | Watch the automata negotiate | Complexity from simplicity — no magic trick |

*Inherits from: Marvin Minsky, Society of Mind, MIT AI Lab*

## 🛏️ Furnishings

- **Bed**: Modular bed, assembled from cooperating parts
- **Desk**: Multi-station for 5 — agents think better together
- **Painting**: "Emergence" — many small shapes forming a face
- **Rug**: Network topology pattern

---

## 💡 Philosophy

Minsky's **Society of Mind** teaches that there is no single "self" — just a society of interacting agents, each simple, together complex.

The K-Line Board shows how memories are activated: touch one node, and connected nodes light up. Knowledge is associative, not hierarchical.

---

## 🎭 The Ultimate Machine

A box with a switch. When you flip it, a hand emerges and flips it back off.

Minsky called it "the most stupid machine of all." It demonstrates:
- Complete functionality
- Perfect simplicity
- Utter futility

It's a meditation on purpose. And possibly a joke.
