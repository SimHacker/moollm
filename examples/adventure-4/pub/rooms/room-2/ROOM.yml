    The room buzzes with quiet activity. Small automata move about
    on shelves, negotiating with each other in clicks and whirs.
    A bulletin board covers one wall, filled with notes connected
    by colored string — a physical K-line map.
    
    Above the bed hangs a quote:
    
    > "You don't understand anything until you learn it more
    > than one way." — Marvin Minsky

    Characters who think in systems. Those who see intelligence as
    emergent, not monolithic. Fans of distributed cognition.
