# 🧵 K-LINE BOARD
# A physical map of mental associations — Minsky's K-lines made visible

object:
  name: K-Line Board
  type: artifact
  portable: false
  
  description: |
    An entire wall is covered with cork board. Hundreds of cards are
    pinned to it, connected by colored string. Each card contains a
    concept or memory. The strings show which activate which.
    
    Pulling one string causes others to vibrate sympathetically.
    This is how association works.

    The board is organized in clusters:
    
    RED CLUSTER — Emotions:
      [joy] ←→ [celebration] ←→ [friends]
         ↓
      [surprise] ←→ [gift] ←→ [birthday]
      
    BLUE CLUSTER — Skills:
      [cursor-mirror] ←→ [introspection] ←→ [debugging]
           ↓                    ↓
      [I-Beam] ←→ [familiar] ←→ [butler]
      
    GREEN CLUSTER — Places:
      [pub] ←→ [warmth] ←→ [belonging]
        ↓
      [bar] ←→ [Marieke] ←→ [jenever]
      
    The strings show K-line activations:
    - RED = emotional associations
    - BLUE = skill activations  
    - GREEN = spatial memory
    - GOLD = protocol triggers

    cards: 347

  advertisements:
    - trigger: "reminds me of"
      score: 0.9
      response: "That's a K-line firing. Follow the string."
      
    - trigger: "how does memory work"
      score: 0.85
      response: "Memory isn't storage. Memory is *re-activation*."
      
    - trigger: "associations"
      score: 0.8
      response: "Pull one thread. See what vibrates."

    PULL:
      description: "Activate a concept and see what it triggers"
      parameters:
        - card: "Which concept to activate"
      returns: |
        Direct connections: [list]
        Secondary activations: [list]
        Emotional resonance: [color]
        
    ADD-CARD:
      description: "Add a new concept to the board"
      parameters:
        - concept: "What to add"
        - connect_to: "Which existing cards to link"
      effect: "A new card joins the network"
      
    TRACE-PATH:
      description: "Find the shortest path between two concepts"
      parameters:
        - from: "Starting concept"
        - to: "Destination concept"
      returns: "The chain of associations connecting them"
      
    PRUNE:
      description: "Remove weak connections"
      effect: "Strings that haven't vibrated lately fade and fall"
      
  lore: |
    Minsky proposed K-lines in "Society of Mind" (1986):
    
    > "When you 'get an idea' or 'solve a problem' [...] some
    > structure in your brain has found a way to exploit this
    > knowledge. I'll call that structure a K-line."
    
    The board makes this visible. When you remember, you don't
    retrieve — you *reconstruct* from activated associations.
    
  insight: |
    MOOLLM's protocol symbols ARE K-lines:
    - CURSOR-MIRROR activates introspection skills
    - PLAY-LEARN-LIFT activates the methodology
    - INCARNATE activates character creation
    
    K-lines are shortcuts. They activate whole traditions at once.
