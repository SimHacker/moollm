  description: |
    A miniature parliament sits on a shelf — a semicircle of tiny
    benches surrounding a speaking podium. Small automata occupy the
    seats, occasionally standing to gesture emphatically at each other.
    
    A sign above reads: "DECISIONS BY COALITION, NOT COMMAND"
    
    Right now they appear to be debating whether the room is too warm.
    
  examine: |
    The parliament contains specialized agents:
    
    SPEAKER (center): "Moderates debate, calls for votes"
    
    LEFT BENCH — Exploration Faction:
      - CURIOUS: "Wants to try new things"
      - PLAYFUL: "Finds joy in experimentation"
      - RANDOM: "Introduces noise to avoid local minima"
      
    RIGHT BENCH — Exploitation Faction:
      - CAREFUL: "Prefers known solutions"
      - EFFICIENT: "Minimizes wasted effort"
      - RELIABLE: "Values consistency"
      
    BACK ROW — Meta Agents:
      - ARBITER: "Resolves deadlocks"
      - HISTORIAN: "Remembers past decisions"
      - CRITIC: "Questions every proposal"
      
    They vote by standing. Majority wins. Ties go to ARBITER.
    
  state:
    current_debate: "optimal room temperature"
    votes_for: 4
    votes_against: 3
    abstaining: 2
    
  advertisements:
    - trigger: "I can't decide"
      score: 0.9
      response: "You contain multitudes. Let them vote."
      
    - trigger: "conflicting goals"
      score: 0.95
      response: "Goals always conflict. That's what parliaments are for."
      
    - trigger: "how do agents cooperate"
      score: 0.8
      response: "They don't agree. They negotiate. Watch."
      
  methods:
    PROPOSE:
      description: "Submit a motion for debate"
      parameters:
        - motion: "What should be decided"
      effect: |
        SPEAKER announces the motion.
        Agents argue their positions.
        A vote is called after debate concludes.
        
    VOTE:
      description: "Call for a vote on current motion"
      returns: |
        Motion: [description]
        For: [count] ([which agents])
        Against: [count] ([which agents])
        Result: PASSED | FAILED | DEADLOCK
        
    LOBBY:
      description: "Try to persuade a specific agent"
      parameters:
        - agent: "Which agent to lobby"
        - argument: "Your persuasion"
      effect: "The agent may change their vote. Or dig in deeper."
      
    OBSERVE:
      description: "Watch the debate without intervening"
      returns: "Real-time transcript of agent arguments"
      
  lore: |
    This parliament was built by a guest who had studied Minsky's
    "Society of Mind" obsessively. She wanted to externalize the
    voices in her head — literally.
    
    The automata are clockwork, but their debates are emergent.
    No one programmed them to argue about room temperature.
    They just... started caring about things.
    
  insight: |
    MOOLLM's skill system is a parliament:
    - Each skill has advertisements (positions)
    - Skills compete for activation (votes)
    - The highest-scoring skill wins (coalition forms)
    - K-lines are party whips (they activate allies)
    
    Intelligence isn't a dictator. It's a democracy.
