object:
  name: Pneumatic Tube Terminal
  type: delivery_system
  location: pub
  
  description: |
    A brass pneumatic tube terminal mounted on the wall near the bar.
    A glass observation window shows capsules whooshing past on their
    way to destinations unknown. A small chute opens at waist height,
    ready to receive or deliver.
    
    A placard reads:
    
      ╔══════════════════════════════════════╗
      ║  BOOTSTRAP BREWING COMPANY           ║
      ║  "From Bean to Brain in 30 Seconds"  ║
      ║                                      ║
      ║  ORDER → BREW → DELIVER              ║
      ║  Powered by ROBO-BARISTA 3000™       ║
      ╚══════════════════════════════════════╝
    
    The tube hums with potential energy. Something could arrive at
    any moment. Or you could send something OUT.
    
  examine: |
    The terminal is a beautiful piece of Victorian-meets-cyberpunk
    engineering. Brass fittings, glass windows, leather gaskets.
    
    INCOMING CHUTE: A padded receptacle for arriving capsules.
    OUTGOING SLOT: Insert items to send to the Bootstrap Room.
    ORDER BUTTONS: A panel of drink options.
    SPEAKER GRILLE: The barista can communicate through this.
    
    A small screen displays:
    
      ROBO-BARISTA 3000™ STATUS: ONLINE
      CURRENT QUEUE: 0 orders
      GARDEN STATION: CONNECTED
      PUB STATION: YOU ARE HERE
      
    Behind the glass, you can see the main tube splitting — one branch
    goes to the garden, one disappears into the wall toward... somewhere
    deeper. The Bootstrap Room, presumably.

    Service! Letters and small packages can be sent through the tube
    to the Bootstrap Room, where they're sorted and forwarded.
    
    SEND LETTER TO [recipient] — Goes through Bootstrap sorting
    SEND PACKAGE TO [recipient] — If it fits in a capsule!

    The speaker occasionally crackles with barista commentary:
    "Another satisfied customer!"
    "BEANS. WATER. PRESSURE. PERFECTION."
    "Is anyone going to pick up this cold brew? ...Anyone?"
