# 📬 Pneumatic Tube Terminal — Pub Station
# Connected to the Bootstrap Room's robot barista

object:
  name: Pneumatic Tube Terminal
  type: delivery_system
  location: pub
  
  description: |
    A brass pneumatic tube terminal mounted on the wall near the bar.
    A glass observation window shows capsules whooshing past on their
    way to destinations unknown. A small chute opens at waist height,
    ready to receive or deliver.
    
    A placard reads:
    
      ╔══════════════════════════════════════╗
      ║  BOOTSTRAP BREWING COMPANY           ║
      ║  "From Bean to Brain in 30 Seconds"  ║
      ║                                      ║
      ║  ORDER → BREW → DELIVER              ║
      ║  Powered by ROBO-BARISTA 3000™       ║
      ╚══════════════════════════════════════╝
    
    The tube hums with potential energy. Something could arrive at
    any moment. Or you could send something OUT.
    
  examine: |
    The terminal is a beautiful piece of Victorian-meets-cyberpunk
    engineering. Brass fittings, glass windows, leather gaskets.
    
    INCOMING CHUTE: A padded receptacle for arriving capsules.
    OUTGOING SLOT: Insert items to send to the Bootstrap Room.
    ORDER BUTTONS: A panel of drink options.
    SPEAKER GRILLE: The barista can communicate through this.
    
    A small screen displays:
    
      ROBO-BARISTA 3000™ STATUS: ONLINE
      CURRENT QUEUE: 0 orders
      GARDEN STATION: CONNECTED
      PUB STATION: YOU ARE HERE
      
    Behind the glass, you can see the main tube splitting — one branch
    goes to the garden, one disappears into the wall toward... somewhere
    deeper. The Bootstrap Room, presumably.

  # Commands
  commands:
    YELL:
      usage: "YELL [order] UP TUBE" or just "ORDER [drink]"
      effect: |
        You lean toward the tube and shout your order into the brass
        opening. Your voice echoes up through the pipes.
        
        A distant, enthusiastic voice responds:
        "ORDER RECEIVED! One [drink] for... let me see..."
        
        The barista invents a CUTE NICKNAME for you on the spot:
        - "One latte for SUNSHINE ADVENTURER!"
        - "Cappuccino for THE BRAVE WAISTCOAT!"
        - "Espresso for DEFINITELY-NOT-GRUE-FOOD!"
        - "Bootstrap Special for MY FAVORITE CUSTOMER TODAY!"
        
        *grinding sounds* *steaming sounds* *whoooosh*
        
        A capsule rockets down the tube and lands with a gentle *thunk*.
        Inside: your drink, PERFECTLY INTACT, topped with an elaborate
        FOAM SCULPTURE that defies physics and the laws of pneumatic
        delivery.
        
    ORDER:
      usage: "ORDER [drink]"
      effect: |
        Same as YELL — the barista hears everything.
        
  # The Magic of Foam Delivery
  foam_magic: |
    The drinks arrive MAGICALLY UNHARMED by the pneumatic journey.
    
    How? Nobody knows. The barista claims it's "PRECISION ENGINEERING"
    but the capsules clearly exceed safe g-forces for foam art.
    
    Theories:
    - The tubes are enchanted
    - The foam is structural
    - Reality bends for good coffee
    - The barista is a wizard (unconfirmed)
    
    Regardless: your cappuccino arrives with a perfect foam grue,
    your latte sports a tiny foam castle, and your Bootstrap Special
    has a foam sculpture of YOUR FACE (somehow accurate).
    
  # Foam Sculptures (barista's specialty)
  foam_sculptures:
    description: |
      ROBO-BARISTA 3000™ takes EXTREME PRIDE in foam art.
      Each drink arrives with a unique sculpture.
      
    examples:
      - "A foam grue (surprisingly cute)"
      - "A tiny foam adventurer holding a lamp"
      - "Your face, rendered in milk foam (unsettling accuracy)"
      - "A foam treasure chest with foam gold coins"
      - "A foam map of the maze (changes daily)"
      - "A foam Mother, looking proud"
      - "A foam skeleton pointing west"
      - "Abstract foam representing 'the concept of hope'"
      - "A foam cat (one of the 8 kittens, rotates)"
      - "A foam version of your current costume"
      
    special_occasions:
      victory: "Foam trophy with 'HERO' written in cocoa"
      death_recovery: "Foam hug (yes, a hug, in foam)"
      first_order: "Foam welcome mat saying 'HELLO FRIEND'"
      regular_customer: "Foam portrait gallery of past visits"
      
  # Order Queue
  order_queue: |
    Orders are delivered IN ORDER, first come first served.
    
    The barista announces each one:
    "NEXT UP: Espresso for CAPTAIN COURAGE!"
    "INCOMING: Cold brew for THE MYSTERIOUS STRANGER!"
    "SPECIAL DELIVERY: Bootstrap Special for FOAM APPRECIATOR!"
    
    If multiple people order, you hear the queue:
    "Three orders ahead of you, PATIENT HERO!"
    "Your drink is NEXT, ALMOST-CAFFEINATED ONE!"
    "HERE IT COMES, WORTHY VESSEL OF COFFEE!"
        
    SEND:
      usage: "SEND [item] TO GARDEN" or "SEND [item] TO BOOTSTRAP"
      effect: |
        Item is loaded into a capsule and whooshed away.
        Arrives at destination in seconds.
        
    TALK:
      usage: "TALK TO BARISTA"
      effect: |
        The speaker crackles. The barista responds.
        Topics: coffee philosophy, the Bootstrap Room, gossip, life advice
        
    CHECK:
      usage: "CHECK TUBE"
      effect: |
        See if anything is waiting in the incoming chute.
        
  # Integration with postal system
  postal_integration: |
    The pneumatic tube connects to the Fantastipants Dungeon Delivery
    Service! Letters and small packages can be sent through the tube
    to the Bootstrap Room, where they're sorted and forwarded.
    
    SEND LETTER TO [recipient] — Goes through Bootstrap sorting
    SEND PACKAGE TO [recipient] — If it fits in a capsule!
    
  ambience: |
    *WHOOOOSH* — A capsule rockets past behind the glass.
    The speaker occasionally crackles with barista commentary:
    "Another satisfied customer!"
    "BEANS. WATER. PRESSURE. PERFECTION."
    "Is anyone going to pick up this cold brew? ...Anyone?"
