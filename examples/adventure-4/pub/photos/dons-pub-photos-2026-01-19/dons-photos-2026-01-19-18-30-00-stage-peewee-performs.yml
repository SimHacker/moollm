    iPhone photo, first-person POV from audience, stage performance.
    Dramatic stage lighting, performer spotlight, audience silhouettes.
    That moment when someone unexpected takes the mic and OWNS it.
    Classic live performance photo energy. Slight motion blur on dancer.
    Warm amber spotlight, dusty, creates a circle of courage.
