    iPhone photo, first-person POV, casual Facebook snapshot aesthetic.
    Warm pub lighting, slightly grainy, authentic candid moment.
    People acknowledge the camera — waving, smiling, posing naturally.
    Not professional photography — real life captured by a friend.
    Late afternoon golden hour light streaming through windows.

  scene: |
    THE GEZELLIGHEID GROTTO bar, 4:30 PM. Amsterdam coffeeshop atmosphere.
    Late afternoon golden light streaming through windows.
    The smell of hops, wood polish, and secrets in the air.
    Warm, reflected light off gleaming bottles.
