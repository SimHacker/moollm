## 📖 The Story

What happens when a California developer walks into an Amsterdam brown café with a monkey on his shoulder? 

Eight photos tell the story: warm welcomes from Marieke, a Fluxx game against the legendary Monkey King himself, all 10 cats piled in the Cat Cave with Biscuit as their reluctant pillow, Pee-wee Herman absolutely killing it on stage while David Bowie offers a bemused thumbs up, Palm achieving high score on Monkey Kong Jr. (beating the Grue's mysterious "GRM" score), and — impossibly — the Wumpus and the Grue sharing the fireplace with Henk like it's the most normal thing in the world.

The final shot captures everyone together. Maximum gezelligheid. Het Orakel being passed. Smoke in the air.

You had to be there. But here's the next best thing.
