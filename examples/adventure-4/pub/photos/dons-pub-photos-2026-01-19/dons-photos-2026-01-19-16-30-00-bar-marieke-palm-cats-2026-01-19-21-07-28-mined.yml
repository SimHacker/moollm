  character_analysis:
    marieke:
      expression: "genuine warmth"       # Not posed — this is real joy
      hand_gesture: "open palm wave"     # Universal welcome, fingers spread
      body_language: "leaning slightly forward"  # Engaged, not defensive
      clothing:
        apron: "olive green, 'LEKKER' in gold"
        shirt: "denim blue, practical"
        notes: |
          LEKKER is quintessentially Dutch — means "delicious" but also
          "nice/good/pleasant". It's untranslatable. The apron IS the pub's
          philosophy: everything here is lekker. The word choice is deliberate.
      confidence: 0.95
      notes: |
        Marieke's smile reaches her eyes (Duchenne smile). She's not performing
        for the camera — she's GREETING whoever's taking this photo. This is
        how she greets everyone. The pub's soul is in that expression.
        
    palm:
      position: "bar counter, between Marieke and camera"
      expression: "curious but calm"     # Wide eyes, but not alarmed
      prop: "tiny espresso cup with saucer"
      body_language: "settled, comfortable"
      confidence: 0.9
      notes: |
        Palm isn't performing monkey tricks. He's just... being here.
        The espresso cup is scaled to his size — someone made or found
        a monkey-sized cup and saucer for him. That's LOVE.
        His eyes are engaging the camera — he knows he's being photographed.
        
    cats:
      count: 2                           # Layer 1 said "2" but didn't identify them
      cat_1:
        location: "windowsill, left side"
        color: "orange tabby"
        posture: "lying down, relaxed"
        identity_guess: "Terpie (the zen one who never moves)"
        confidence: 0.8
      cat_2:
        location: "bar counter, right side"
        color: "tortoiseshell/calico"
        posture: "sitting upright, alert"
        identity_guess: "Stroopwafel (judging from above)"
        confidence: 0.75
      notes: |
        Two cats, two personalities. The orange one on the windowsill
        hasn't moved in hours — pure cat zen. The tortie on the counter
        is watchful, supervising. Classic cat hierarchy on display.

  design_history:
    espresso_machine:
      style: "Art Nouveau / Belle Époque"
      era_estimate: "1890-1910 aesthetic"
      material: "copper, brass"
      details: "Bird finial on top, ornate spout, industrial elegance"
      confidence: 0.85
      notes: |
        This is the 1952 copper espresso machine mentioned in the room YAML.
        The design language is earlier — Art Nouveau — which means it was
        either built in homage or is genuinely antique. The bird finial
        suggests Italian craftsmanship (La Pavoni style). This machine
        is a character in itself. Henk's sixth espresso comes from HERE.
        
    bottles_background:
      arrangement: "floor to ceiling, no empty space"
      bottle_types:
        - "tall Dutch jenever bottles (ceramic, brown)"
        - "square liquor bottles (various spirits)"
        - "wine bottles (dark glass)"
        - "mysterious unlabeled vessels"
      lighting_effect: "bottles catch golden window light, glow like stained glass"
      notes: |
        The bottle wall isn't decorative — it's FUNCTIONAL. This pub serves
        everything. The variety suggests decades of accumulation. Some bottles
        are dusty (rarely ordered), some gleam (popular). Archaeology in glass.

    gezelligheid:
      intensity: 0.95                    # Maximum cozy Dutch warmth
      confidence: 0.95
      evidence:
        - "LEKKER apron — untranslatable Dutch pleasure-word"
        - "Mixed company (human, monkey, cats) without hierarchy"
        - "Warm lighting, worn wood, accumulated objects"
        - "No sterility — everything is USED"
      notes: |
        This IS gezelligheid made visible. The Dutch concept doesn't translate
        because it's not just "cozy" — it's the feeling of belonging, warmth,
        social pleasure, and contentment all at once. This image could
        illustrate the dictionary entry.
        
    dutch_pub_tradition:
      elements:
        - "Brown café aesthetic (bruine kroeg)"
        - "Jenever bottles (Dutch gin heritage)"
        - "LEKKER text (Dutch language marker)"
        - "Practical warmth over polish"
      notes: "This is Amsterdam before tourists. Leiden on a Tuesday. Home."

  narrative_pov:
    photographer:
      identity_inference: "Don Hopkins"  # Based on the photo set context
      position: "standing at bar, slightly lower than Marieke"
      relationship: "regular, known, welcomed"
      evidence:
        - "Marieke waves AT the camera, not past it"
        - "Palm is calm — he knows this person"
        - "Cats unbothered — familiar presence"
      notes: |
        The camera position is first-person — we are Don taking this photo.
        The wave is for US. We're not documenting strangers; we're capturing
        friends. This changes everything about how the image reads.
        
    moment_captured:
      spontaneity: 0.8                   # Mostly candid, slight awareness
      staging: 0.2                       # Marieke knows she's being photographed
      notes: |
        This is the perfect balance — candid enough to be real, acknowledged
        enough to be a portrait. Everyone knows the camera is there, and
        nobody cares. That's trust. That's home.

  compositional_analysis:
    focal_point: "Marieke's face, specifically her smile"
    secondary_foci: ["Palm with espresso", "tortie cat", "espresso machine"]
    rule_of_thirds: "Marieke slightly right of center, balanced by machine on left"
    depth_layers:
      - "Foreground: bar counter, Palm, espresso cup"
      - "Middle: Marieke, cats, espresso machine"
      - "Background: bottle wall, window light"
    lighting_direction: "Window on left, golden hour"
    notes: |
      The composition draws eye to Marieke's wave, then spirals:
      wave → face → Palm → espresso → machine → bottles → window → back to wave.
      It's a visual conversation that keeps you IN the image.

  what_layer_1_missed:
    - "The SECOND cat (orange on windowsill)"
    - "The espresso machine's Art Nouveau details"
    - "LEKKER's cultural untranslatability"
    - "The POV is first-person from a friend"
    - "Palm's espresso cup is deliberately monkey-sized"
    - "The wave is acknowledgment, not performance"
    
  deeper_resonance:
    theme: "home is where they wave when you walk in"
    emotional_core: |
      This isn't a bar scene. It's a family portrait disguised as a snapshot.
      The monkey has his own cup. The cats have their spots. The bartender
      waves because she knows you. The espresso machine has been here
      longer than anyone. Gezelligheid isn't a concept — it's THIS.
      
    meta_observation: |
      Layer 1 (OpenAI) mined the WHAT. Layer 2 (Claude) mines the WHY.
      Both are necessary. The image needs multiple perspectives to reveal
      its full depth. This is why multi-look mining matters.
