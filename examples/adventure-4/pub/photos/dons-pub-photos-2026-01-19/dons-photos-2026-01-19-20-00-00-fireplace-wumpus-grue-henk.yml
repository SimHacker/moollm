    iPhone photo, first-person POV, warm fireplace lighting.
    The impossible photo — creatures of darkness and caves, civilized.
    Slightly unbelievable, dreamlike quality, but presented as candid.
    "I swear this actually happened" energy.
    Warm fire glow vs shadows. Surreal coziness.

    THE HEARTH, main pub floor, 8:00 PM.
    
    ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    THE FIREPLACE ENVIRONMENT (from pub/fireplace.yml)
    ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    
    THE FIREPLACE ITSELF:
    - LARGE STONE fireplace dominating one wall
    - Crackling warmly, fire always just right
    - Never seems to need tending (magic? love?)
    - Blackened stones with centuries of soot
    - Names and dates carved into mantle
      (adventurers who warmed themselves before heading into darkness)
    
    THE MANTLE (cluttered with curios):
    - SHIP IN A BOTTLE: Gift from a sailor who never returned
    - MYSTERIOUS KEY: No one knows what it opens (plot hook)
    - SMALL PORTRAIT: Bartender's grandmother? Or something else?
    - TIP JAR: Contains exactly 7 gold at all times (mystery)
    
    THE HEARTHSTONE:
    - Worn smooth by countless boots
    - ODD SYMBOL carved into it...
    - (It's a teleportation rune. Say the right word...)
    - (The bartender knows. Information costs.)
    
    WORN ARMCHAIRS:
    - Several arranged around the fire
    - Leather, ancient, comfortable
    - One chair is MUCH larger than the others (Wumpus-sized)
    
    ATMOSPHERE:
    - Fire crackles, sparks drift up the chimney
    - Warmth seeps into bones after the cold of the maze
    - For a moment, everything feels safe
    - (But you know better than to trust that feeling)
    
    ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    FEATURED CHARACTERS (explicit visual descriptions)
    ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    
    THE WUMPUS (in an armchair, barely fitting):
    - MASSIVE creature, fills the entire armchair and then some
    - LEATHERY HIDE, glistening slightly in firelight
    - Dark greenish-brown coloration, ancient texture
    - Too many TEETH — but currently smiling politely
    - One huge MILKY EYE, ancient and knowing
    - OLD ARROW SCAR visible on hide (from past hunters)
    - Currently wearing... READING GLASSES? (perched on nose ridge)
    - TINY TEACUP held delicately in enormous clawed hands
    - Inexplicably wearing a HAT (jaunty angle)
    - Looking at camera with surprisingly GENTLE expression
    - Smells like sulfur, wet dog, and regret (you can almost see it)
    - The creature from Hunt the Wumpus (1973), civilized tonight
    - "Oddly polite before eating you" — but tonight, just polite
    - Invited guest. Standing invitation from tribunal.
    
    THE GRUE (in the shadows BESIDE the fire):
    - Exists where firelight doesn't quite reach
    - BARELY VISIBLE — mostly just:
      * GLOWING EYES in the darkness
      * SO MANY TEETH (gleaming in shadow)
      * A suggestion of form, more darkness than creature
    - One SHADOWY APPENDAGE raised in GREETING
    - Waving at camera. Friendly. Tonight.
    - "It is pitch black. You are likely to be... having tea?"
    - NOT eating anyone tonight. Special occasion.
    - The firelight holds it at bay, but it's comfortable there
    - The ABSENCE OF LIGHT given form
    - GRM high score holder on Pac-Man (how? who knows)
    
    HENK (in his usual chair, completely unbothered):
    - Older Dutch man, 60s-70s, worn coat
    - Espresso #6 in hand, raised in slight toast
    - Weathered face, knowing eyes
    - COMPLETELY UNBOTHERED by the cosmic horror guests
    - He's seen weirder. He always has.
    - Giving camera a slight nod of acknowledgment
    - The Constant. Was here before Marieke.
    - "Philosophy is just comedy without timing"
    
    LILY (Linalool, on Henk's lap):
    - Soft grey kitten with LAVENDER-TINTED ears
    - Curled up peacefully, eyes half-closed
    - INEXPLICABLY COMFORTABLE even with monsters present
    - She senses they mean no harm tonight
    - The empath kitten who always knows
    - Purring softly, spa soundtrack frequency
    - They understand something together
    
    W.W. JACOBS (ghost, hovering in another chair):
    - TRANSLUCENT Victorian-era gentleman
    - The author of "The Monkey's Paw" (1902)
    - Ghostly form, slightly glowing silver
    - Proper suit, mutton chops, dignified bearing
    - Watching from another armchair
    - Expression: FINALLY AT PEACE
    - 122 years of his curse causing suffering
    - Tonight he watched someone break it with kindness

    - Panel member from the tribunal
    
    ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    ATMOSPHERIC DETAILS
    ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    
    - Crackling flames, warm orange glow
    - Ancient hearthstone with mysterious inscriptions
    - Smoke curling up the chimney
    - The intersection of light and dark
    - Warmth vs the cold of the maze these creatures came from
    - Other patrons giving wide berth (sensible)
    - Stroopwafel supervising from a safe distance
    - The cats accepted the Wumpus. That matters.

  mood: |
    Surreal coziness. The impossible made comfortable.
    Mortal enemies (adventurer, wumpus, grue) sharing a fireside moment.
    The magic of the Grotto: even monsters are welcome.
    The Dutch concept of gezelligheid: cozy togetherness.
    Even primordial darkness can be invited in from the cold.
    Fire crackles. Sparks drift. Everything feels safe.
    (But you know better. Tonight, safety is real.)
