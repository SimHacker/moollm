    sun_wukong:
      position: "left foreground, dominant"
      confidence: 0.95
      visual_markers:
        - "Golden circlet/diadem on forehead (the REAL one restrains him)"
        - "Red and gold robes (classical Chinese style)"
        - "Golden staff (Ruyi Jingu Bang, size-changing cudgel)"
        - "Primate features with human expressions"
        - "Victory/peace sign with hand"
      expression: "absolute glee, mischievous triumph"
      body_language: "leaning forward, asserting dominance over the game"
      notes: |
        THE Monkey King from Journey to the West. One of the most powerful
        beings in Chinese mythology — he fought heaven itself. And here he is,
        playing Fluxx in a Dutch pub, throwing a peace sign.
        
        The circlet is the Band of Discipline — it tightens when he misbehaves.
        Tripitaka used it to control him. Here, no one needs to control him.
        He's CHOOSING to be here. That's the point.

        - "Small monkey (not mythic, just curious)"
        - "Holding cards with concentration"
      expression: "focused, slightly worried"
      notes: |
        The MAN with the yellow hat's companion. From H.A. Rey's children's books.
        George isn't a god — he's just a curious little monkey who gets into trouble.
        Next to Sun Wukong (literally a deity), George is hilariously outclassed.
        But he's concentrating on his cards. He takes this SERIOUSLY.
        
    henk:
      position: "center-right"
      confidence: 0.85

      expression: "philosophical resignation"
      body_language: "leaning back slightly, observing more than competing"
      notes: |
        Henk is the pub regular who's seen everything. He's not trying to win.
        He's here for the company and the espresso. His expression says
        "I've been playing cards with a deity and a cartoon monkey, 
        and somehow this is just Tuesday."
        
    kristin_looney:
      position: "far right"
      confidence: 0.85
      visual_markers:
        - "Grey sweater, casual"
        - "Thumbs up gesture"
        - "Knowing smile"
      expression: "confident amusement"
      body_language: "relaxed confidence of someone who knows they're winning"
      notes: |
        Kristin Looney co-founded Looney Labs with her husband Andy.
        They INVENTED Fluxx. She's playing her own game against the Monkey King.
        The thumbs up isn't hope — it's CERTAINTY. She knows the rules better
        than a deity. She WROTE them. She changes them whenever she wants.
        
        This is like playing chess with Magnus Carlsen, except Magnus also
        designed the board you're playing on.

  the_game:
    name: "Fluxx"
    publisher: "Looney Labs"
    core_mechanic: "The rules change during play"
    philosophy: |
      In Fluxx, you start with "draw 1, play 1" — but cards change the rules.
      Goals shift. Limits appear and vanish. You might be winning one turn
      and losing the next because someone played a new Goal card.
      
      It's a game ABOUT change. About adaptation. About chaos.
      Perfect for a pub where the Monkey King plays cards with the co-creator.
      
    visible_cards:
      center_pile: "DRAW pile, face-up cards visible"
      readable_text:
        - "DRAW (visible on one card)"
        - "RAND EIME 2 (possibly "Random Time"? card text)"
      notes: "AI-generated text is partly garbled but reads as Fluxx-ish"
      
    meta_joke: |
      Kristin Looney invented Fluxx. Sun Wukong is literally chaos embodied.
      When chaos itself plays a game about chaos against the person who
      invented the rules... who wins? The answer is: the game itself.

  the_pie_table:
    shape: "octagonal"
    surface_design: "radial wedge pattern, alternating wood tones"
    center_element: "brass bell or finial"
    seating: "8 positions (4 visible)"
    notes: |
      The Pie Table is THE democratic institution of the Gezelligheid Grotto.
      Eight seats. Everyone equal. The brass bell in the center is for
      calling votes, settling disputes, or announcing last call.
      
      The radial pattern isn't decoration — it's FUNCTION. Each wedge is
      a player's territory. Cards stay in your wedge. Drinks stay in your wedge.
      The geometry creates order from chaos. (Which is ironic given Fluxx.)

  mythological_mashup:
    layers:
      - deity: "Sun Wukong (Chinese mythology)"
      - children_lit: "Curious George (1941 children's books)"
      - mundane: "Henk (regular Dutch guy)"
      - meta: "Kristin Looney (literal game designer)"
    analysis: |
      This image collapses hierarchy. A god, a cartoon, a regular guy,
      and a game designer all sit as equals at an octagonal table.
      The Grotto treats EVERYONE the same. The guestbook doesn't care
      if you're real, fictional, mythic, or divine. You're welcome.
      
      This is the pub's thesis statement: everyone is equal at the table.

  what_layer_1_missed:
    - "Layer 1 counted 1 monkey — there are 2 (Wukong + George)"
    - "Kristin isn't just 'a woman' — she INVENTED the game"
    - "Sun Wukong isn't 'a monkey' — he's a deity who fought heaven"
    - "The pie table's octagonal design is functional, not decorative"
    - "George's yellow hat is THE yellow hat from the books"
    - "Henk's espresso cup suggests an ongoing caffeine ritual"

  compositional_insight:
    framing: "Wukong dominates left third, breaks frame with energy"
    balance: "His chaos balanced by Kristin's calm confidence on right"
    center: "George and Henk as bridge — the curious and the philosophical"
    notes: |
      The composition creates a dialogue between chaos (left) and order (right).
      Wukong's diagonal energy crashes against Kristin's static certainty.
      The pie table contains them both. That's the magic of the Grotto.

  deeper_resonance:
    theme: "All players are equal regardless of origin"
    emotional_core: |
      A god from 16th century Chinese literature plays cards with a character
      from 1940s children's books while a Dutch regular drinks espresso and
      the game's inventor watches them all. And NONE of this is strange.
      
      The Grotto exists outside hierarchy. Myth meets mundane meets meta.
      Everyone just... plays. That's the whole point.

  exhausted: false
  next_suggested_focus: |
    Layer 3 could analyze: card game theory (what's the optimal Fluxx strategy
    against a chaos deity?), the architecture of the pub visible in background,
    or the phenomenology of fictional characters becoming real through belief.
