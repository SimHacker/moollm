  Abstract Pixar-adjacent stylized CGI, Scott McCloud masking aesthetic — warm rounded shapes, simplified features.
  
  PUB TABLE SCENE: A RABBIT in tie-dye hoodie holding a PHONE, scrolling through social media. His EARS ARE DROOPING with each swipe. Expression: growing horror/disbelief at what he's seeing on screen.
  
  PHONE SCREEN VISIBLE: Shows a selfie of an orange character doing peace signs (Donna's post).
  
  ACROSS THE TABLE: Orange-skinned character with pink heart glasses (Donna) watching with an amused, unbothered expression. Sipping her drink.
  
  OTHER FIGURES: White-bearded gentleman (Richard), another person, watching the rabbit's reaction.
  
  MOOD: The moment of realization. "She documented ALL of this?!" Rabbit processing the night from content creator's perspective.
  
  LIGHTING: Warm pub amber, phone screen glow on rabbit's face.
  
  Style: Cozy pub, wood paneling, firelight, the horror of being hashtagged.
