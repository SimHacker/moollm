  setup: |
    Don hops onto the small stage.
    Adjusts the mic down (rabbit height).
    Taps it. THUMP THUMP.
    
    "Is this thing on?"
    
    The pub quiets.
    
    "So. You've all seen Donna's feed tonight.
     The triumphant documentation.
     The selfies. The hashtags.
     
     But let me tell you what ACTUALLY happened.
     From the perspective of someone who was THERE.
     
     Step by step.
     
     *clears throat, ears twitch*
     
     And yes, I know I'm a rabbit now. We'll GET to that."

    step_01:
      dons_version: |
        "Step one. My FRIEND—"
        *points at instigator*
        "—this guy— invites me on an 'adventure.'
        
        'Hey Don, let's check out this abandoned warehouse!
         It'll be fun! Nothing weird!'
        
        HE KNEW. He KNEW about the tunnels.
        He KNEW about the levers.
        He KNEW about DONNA."
        
      donnas_feed_showed: "'Intruders detected! 👀'"
      
      the_truth: "We were SET UP."
      
    step_02:
      dons_version: |
        "Step two. The TUNNELS.
        
        I'm walking toward this building, right?
        And there's this painted tunnel on the wall.
        Checkerboard pattern. Goes forever.
        
        I think: 'Neat mural!'
        
        I do NOT think: 'That's a TRAP.'
        I do NOT think: 'Someone is WATCHING me admire this.'
        I do NOT think: 'TUNNEL STATUS: ACTIVE.'"
        
      donnas_feed_showed: "'WATCH THIS! 🌀'"
      
      the_truth: "She was watching me get HYPNOTIZED by PAINT."
      
    step_03:
      dons_version: |
        "Step three. The ANVIL.
        
        I walk through the door.
        Normal door. Seems safe.
        
        And then—
        
        *mimics looking up*
        
        An ANVIL. Swinging down.
        Like a CARTOON.
        
        I see it. I DODGE.
        
        My friend? Didn't even NOTICE.
        Just walked right past while I'm having a NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCE.
        
        And DONNA?"
        
      donnas_feed_showed: "'I DID THAT! 🔨💪'"
      
      the_truth: "She DEPLOYED it. And took a SELFIE."
      
    step_04:
      dons_version: |
        "Step four. I step inside.
        
        And I realize...
        
        This isn't a warehouse.
        This is a DIMENSION.
        
        It's BIGGER on the inside.
        The tunnels are on BOTH sides now.
        
        The TUNNELS. MULTIPLIED.
        
        While I was standing there!
        
        And I'm wearing this jacket—"
        *gestures at tie-dye*
        "—which apparently makes me a TARGET."
        
      donnas_feed_showed: "'I TOLD YOU THE TUNNELS MULTIPLY! 🌀🌀'"
      
      the_truth: "She was VINDICATED by my TERROR."
      
    step_05:
      dons_version: |
        "Step five. The CONVEYOR.
        
        My friend— Gary— he steps on what looks like FLOOR.
        
        It's not floor. It's a CONVEYOR BELT.
        
        He's SURFING BOXES toward the back of the warehouse.
        Arms out. Can't stop.
        
        I'm yelling: 'GARY! GARY!'
        
        And from somewhere— I don't know where—
        I swear I hear someone say:
        
        'CHOO CHOO! ALL ABOARD!'"
        
      donnas_feed_showed: "'MANDATORY TOUR IN PROGRESS 🎢'"
      
      the_truth: "She was the CONDUCTOR. We were the CARGO."
      
    step_06:
      dons_version: |
        "Step six. ROCKET SKATES.
        
        Gary finds... I don't know... a lever? A button?
        
        Next thing I know—
        
        WHOOOOSH.
        
        He's HORIZONTAL. Flames from his FEET.
        Through the WINDOW.
        
        I'm ducking. Glass everywhere.
        My friend is a PROJECTILE.
        
        And somewhere..."
        
        *long pause*
        
        "Somewhere, someone is doing a CHEF'S KISS."
        
      donnas_feed_showed: "'PROPULSION SUCCESSFUL! 🚀' *chef's kiss pose*"
      
      the_truth: "He could have DIED. She thought it was CUISINE."
      
    step_07:
      dons_version: |
        "Step seven. The TUNNEL.
        
        I need to get OUT.
        I see a passage. Blue. Deep. Looks like an exit.
        
        I RUN.
        
        I run TOWARD IT.
        
        And then—"
        
        *touches nose*
        
        "THWACK.
        
        It's paint. It was ALWAYS paint.
        A FLAT WALL painted to look like infinity.
        
        My face. On brick.
        
        Glasses? Gone. Dignity? Gone.
        
        And DONNA?"
        
      donnas_feed_showed: "'HE HIT THE TUNNEL!!! 💥 THWACK!!!' *Home Alone face*"
      
      the_truth: "She did the MACAULAY CULKIN because I hit a WALL."
      
    step_08:
      dons_version: |
        "Step eight. The building is ON FIRE.
        
        I don't know how. Don't ask.
        
        We're outside. Alive. Somehow.
        Looking at the burning building.
        
        And Donna?
        
        DOUBLE PEACE SIGNS.
        'Another successful night.'
        
        SUCCESSFUL. NIGHT.
        
        THE BUILDING IS ON FIRE."
        
      donnas_feed_showed: "'ANOTHER SUCCESSFUL NIGHT AT ACME SURPLUS 🔥🍄👑'"
      
      the_truth: "Her definition of 'successful' is CONCERNING."
      
    step_09:
      dons_version: |
        "And finally. Step nine.
        
        A rabbit.
        
        I am currently A RABBIT.
        
        This—"
        *gestures at entire rabbit body*
        "—is APPARENTLY because I tried to give RICHARD bunny ears
        in a SELFIE weeks ago.
        
        The spell BOUNCED BACK.
        
        And then tonight— with the STRESS—
        with the ANVILS and ROCKETS and THWACKS—
        
        It... completed.
        
        I am a RABBIT.
        In TIE-DYE.
        In a PUB.
        Telling this STORY.
        
        And DONNA?"
        
      donnas_feed_showed: "'Normal Tuesday night 🔥🐰🌀'"
      
      the_truth: |
        *voice cracks*
        
        "I'm the RABBIT EMOJI.
         
         She HASHTAGGED me.
         
         I'm a HASHTAG now."

  conclusion: |
    Don stands at the mic.
    
    Ears flat. Whiskers still.
    
    The pub is silent.
    
    Then:
    
    "So that's MY side.
     
     Step by step.
     
     The REAL story.
     
     Any questions?"
     
    *long pause*
    
    Someone in the back: "...Can you do magic tricks?"
    
    Don: "I'M A RABBIT BECAUSE OF MAGIC AND YOU WANT TRICKS?!"
    
    The pub erupts.
    
    Donna, from her table, raises her glass.
    
    "That was good content."
    
    Don: "I— THAT'S NOT— THAT'S NOT THE POINT!"
    
    But he's smiling. A little.
    Rabbit faces can smile.
    
    He hops off stage.
    
    Someone hands him another carrot juice.
    
    "Same time next week?" asks the bartender.
    
    Don looks at his paws. At his friends. At Donna.
    
    "...Maybe."
