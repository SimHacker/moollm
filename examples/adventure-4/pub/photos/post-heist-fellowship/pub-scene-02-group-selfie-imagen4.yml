  Abstract Pixar-adjacent stylized CGI, Scott McCloud masking aesthetic — warm, rounded, simplified features allowing projection.
  
  GROUP PUB SELFIE — someone is holding the camera to capture everyone at the table!
  
  THE FELLOWSHIP (crowded together, leaning in for the shot):
  
  1. RABBIT in tie-dye hoodie — making peace sign with paw, happy rabbit grin, ears tall
  
  2. Distinguished older gentleman with white beard and round glasses — bemused expression, holding pint, leaning in awkwardly like he's never done a group selfie before
  
  3. Orange-skinned character with blonde pompadour and pink heart glasses — BACK ON, genuine smile, one arm around someone's shoulder
  
  4. Another figure in green — making bunny ears behind Richard's head (the irony!)
  
  PUB BACKGROUND: Warm wood paneling, fireplace glow, pendant lamps, other patrons blurred.
  
  STYLE: Warm, crowded, imperfect — the awkward joy of a real group selfie. Abstract faces where appropriate. Universal fellowship.
  
  MOOD: Found family. Unlikely friends. The photo you take at 3 AM after surviving something together. Nobody looks perfect. Everyone looks happy.
  
  COMPOSITION: Classic group selfie chaos — someone's cutting off, someone's blinking, but it captures the MOMENT.
