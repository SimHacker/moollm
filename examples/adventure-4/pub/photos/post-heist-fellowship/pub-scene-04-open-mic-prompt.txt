Abstract Pixar-adjacent stylized CGI, Scott McCloud masking aesthetic — warm, expressive, simplified features.

SMALL PUB STAGE with spotlight. A RABBIT in tie-dye hoodie stands at the MICROPHONE (adjusted down to rabbit height). His paws grip the mic stand. EARS EXPRESSIVE — sometimes up (making a point), sometimes flat (reliving trauma).

EXPRESSION: Animated storytelling — gesturing with one paw while speaking into mic. Passionate, exasperated, telling his SIDE of the story.

AUDIENCE VISIBLE: At pub tables in foreground/middle ground:
- Orange character with pink glasses (Donna) looking amused
- White-bearded gentleman (Richard) listening thoughtfully  
- Other pub patrons, engaged

STAGE SETUP: Small wooden platform, single spotlight, brick wall behind, "OPEN MIC" sign or chalkboard.

MOOD: Stand-up comedy meets trauma processing. The rabbit finally gets to tell HIS version. Equal parts funny and cathartic.

LIGHTING: Warm spotlight on rabbit, ambient pub glow on audience.

Style: Intimate comedy club vibe in cozy pub, the rabbit as unlikely performer.
