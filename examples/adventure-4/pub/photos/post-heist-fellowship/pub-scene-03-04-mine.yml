  emergent_text: "She documelated ALL of this??"
  
  typo_analysis: |
    "documelated" instead of "documented"
    
    This is PERFECT. This is how someone says it when:
    - They're in shock
    - They're a rabbit now
    - They just discovered they're a hashtag
    
    The typo IS the character.

  narrative_moment: |
    Don finally gets to tell HIS side.
    
    Step by step.
    
    The anvil. The conveyor. The rocket skates.
    The THWACK. The fire. The rabbit transformation.
    
    And through it all:
    "She was CHEF'S KISSING. She was doing PEACE SIGNS.
     She HASHTAGGED me."
     
    It's therapy.
    It's comedy.
    It's the truth.

# THE TESTIMONY THEMES

themes:
  multiple_perspectives: |
    The same events, told differently.
    
    Donna's feed: Triumph. Content. Success.
    Don's testimony: Terror. Chaos. Survival.
    
    Both are true.
    That's the horror.
    That's also the comedy.
    
  processing_through_performance: |
    Don doesn't just TELL the story.
    He PERFORMS it.
    
    Stand-up comedy as therapy.
    Open mic as catharsis.
    
    The audience laughs.
    He's also healing.
    
  the_hashtag_wound: |
    "I'm the rabbit emoji. She HASHTAGGED me."
    
    This is the deepest cut.
    
    Not the anvil. Not the wall. Not the transformation.
    
    Being reduced to content.
    Being made into a symbol.
    Being documented without consent.
    
    (Donna did ask for forgiveness later, kind of.
     "Content doesn't create itself."
     It's not an apology. But it's something.)

# CLOSING

closing_note: |
  "Same time next week?" asks the bartender.
  
  Don looks at his paws. At his friends. At Donna.
  
  "...Maybe."
  
  The rabbit has found his voice.
  The story has been told.
  
  And somewhere, Donna is probably already
  planning how to document THAT.
