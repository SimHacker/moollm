# SYNTHESIZED PROMPT
# Edit this to regenerate with tweaks!
prompt: |
  Abstract Pixar-adjacent stylized CGI, Scott McCloud masking aesthetic — warm, expressive, simplified features.
  
  SMALL PUB STAGE with spotlight. A RABBIT in tie-dye hoodie stands at the MICROPHONE (adjusted down to rabbit height). His paws grip the mic stand. EARS EXPRESSIVE — sometimes up (making a point), sometimes flat (reliving trauma).
  
  EXPRESSION: Animated storytelling — gesturing with one paw while speaking into mic. Passionate, exasperated, telling his SIDE of the story.
  
  AUDIENCE VISIBLE: At pub tables in foreground/middle ground:
  - Orange character with pink glasses (Donna) looking amused
  - White-bearded gentleman (Richard) listening thoughtfully  
  - Other pub patrons, engaged
  
  STAGE SETUP: Small wooden platform, single spotlight, brick wall behind, "OPEN MIC" sign or chalkboard.
  
  MOOD: Stand-up comedy meets trauma processing. The rabbit finally gets to tell HIS version. Equal parts funny and cathartic.
  
  LIGHTING: Warm spotlight on rabbit, ambient pub glow on audience.
  
  Style: Intimate comedy club vibe in cozy pub, the rabbit as unlikely performer.
