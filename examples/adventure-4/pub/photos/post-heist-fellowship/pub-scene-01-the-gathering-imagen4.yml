  Abstract Pixar-adjacent stylized CGI with Scott McCloud masking aesthetic — simplified faces with minimal features allowing projection, warm rounded shapes, universal expressions through abstraction.
  
  COZY PUB INTERIOR at night. Warm amber lighting from mismatched lamps. Wood paneling, worn smooth. Fire crackling in hearth. Smoke curling toward ceiling. Pint glasses catching golden light.
  
  AROUND A WORN WOODEN TABLE, an unlikely fellowship:
  
  1. A RABBIT in tie-dye hoodie — grey fur, long ears, sitting upright on bench, surprisingly content, carrot juice in front of him
  
  2. Distinguished older gentleman with white beard, round glasses (slightly bent), brown cardigan (singed edges) — processing expression, pint in hand
  
  3. Orange-skinned character with blonde pompadour, navy suit (unbuttoned), pink heart glasses PUSHED UP on forehead — softer expression than usual, genuine smile, drink in hand
  
  4. Another figure buying drinks at the bar (the instigator)
  
  STYLE: Abstract faces — dots for eyes, simple curves for mouths, emotions readable through shape and posture rather than detail. Warm, rounded, inviting. The viewer projects themselves into these characters.
  
  MOOD: Post-adventure fellowship. Exhausted relief. Unlikely friends. Warm amber glow. Nobody asks questions here.
  
  Lighting: Firelight, lamp glow, golden warmth throughout.
