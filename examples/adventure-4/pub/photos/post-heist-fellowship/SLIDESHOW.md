# 🍺 The Neverending Arms

> *"The quiet after the storm."*

Four scenes from the pub where the fellowship gathered after the heist. Fire, tunnels, transformation — and then drinks by the fireplace.

**Aesthetic**: Scott McCloud masking — abstract faces allow viewer projection, specific characters retain identity.

## 📍 Scene 01: The Gathering

### *"Nobody's talking about what happened. They don't need to."*

**Time**: ~02:30 AM  
**Location**: Corner table by the fireplace

**The Fellowship**:
- **Rabbit Don**: Tie-dye hoodie, eyes closed in contentment, carrot juice
- **Richard Bartle**: White beard, PIPE EMERGED (not prompted!), pint of ale
- **Masked figures**: Orange faces with simple features — Scott McCloud masking

**The Silence**: The fireplace crackles. Someone takes a sip. The rabbit's ears twitch. This is fellowship.

## 📍 Scene 02: The Group Selfie

### *"BACK ON"*

![Group Selfie](pub-scene-02-group-selfie-imagen4.png)

**The Photo**: Don-rabbit making peace sign. Richard bemused, wearing a SCARF (emerged!). Donna waving. And someone making BUNNY EARS behind Richard.

**Chekhov's Bunny Ears**: The same gesture that transformed Don is being performed behind Richard. Loaded gun.

**Emergent Text**: "BACK ON" — the camera is recording again.

## 📍 Scene 03: Reviewing the Feed

### *"She documelated ALL of this??"*

![Reviewing Feed](pub-scene-03-reviewing-feed-imagen4.png)

**The Horror**: Don looks at his phone. SWEAT DROPS. Donna's entire selfie feed is there. Every moment of the heist. Every trap. Every transformation.

**Emergent Typo**: "documelated" — perfect distressed rabbit pronunciation.

**Don's Realization**: He was CONTENT. He was CONTEXT. Donna made him into ENGAGEMENT.

## 📍 Scene 04: The Open Mic

### *"Let me tell you MY side of the story."*

![Open Mic](pub-scene-04-open-mic-imagen4.png)

**Don's Response**: After seeing Donna's feed, Don takes the stage. Open mic. Spotlight. Microphone adjusted to rabbit height.

**The Performance**: Don recounts the heist from HIS perspective. Donna and Richard in the audience. Trauma processed through storytelling.
