# SCOTT McCLOUD MASKING ANALYSIS

masking_notes:
  principle: |
    "The more cartoony a face, the more people it could be said to describe."
    — Scott McCloud, Understanding Comics
    
  application:
    scene_01:
      detailed: "Richard (specific), Don (specific form)"
      abstracted: "Orange figures (universal, projectable)"
      
    scene_02:
      detailed: "Richard, Don (specific characters)"
      semi_abstracted: "Donna, Instigator (recognizable but simpler)"
      
    scene_03:
      detailed: "Don (emotional specificity required)"
      varied: "Others less detailed = focus on Don's reaction"
      
    scene_04:
      detailed: "Don on stage (performer = specific)"
      audience_abstracted: "Allows viewer to BE in audience"

# FELLOWSHIP PROGRESSION

fellowship_arc:
  scene_01: "Quiet gathering, processing in silence"
  scene_02: "Group photo — claiming the moment together"
  scene_03: "Don discovers his trauma was content"
  scene_04: "Don reclaims his narrative via open mic"
  
  resolution: |
    The fellowship formed through shared catastrophe.
    Nobody planned to be friends.
    Nobody expected to survive together.
    But here they are.
    
    Drinks. Firelight. Stories.
    The quiet after the storm.

# HOW TO USE THIS CONTEXT

usage_note: |
  When generating pub-related content:
  
  1. Maintain Scott McCloud masking where appropriate
  2. Reference character positions/states from mines
  3. Build on established fellowship dynamics
  4. Note emergent elements (pipe, bunny ears, typos)
  5. Allow warm, amber, cozy aesthetic
  
  The pub is a SAFE SPACE after chaos.
  Render accordingly.
