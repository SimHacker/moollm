# LAYER 1: THE CHARACTERS

layer_characters:

  rabbit_don:
    position: "Left side of table"
    appearance:
      species: "Full rabbit"
      clothing: "Tie-dye hoodie — the signature"
      ears: "Long, grey, relaxed"
      expression: "Eyes closed — content, peaceful"
    drink: "Carrot juice (orange, in small glass)"
    
    interpretation: |
      Don has ACCEPTED his rabbit form.
      
      Eyes closed = peace.
      Tie-dye still fits = continuity of self.
      Carrot juice appeared without ordering = the universe provides.
      
      He's not fighting it anymore.
      He's a rabbit. It's okay.
      
  masked_figure_1:
    position: "Left-center"
    appearance:
      face: "SIMPLE — dot eyes, curved smile"
      color: "Orange"
      hair: "Brown, simple shape"
    
    masking_analysis: |
      SCOTT McCLOUD MASKING in action.
      
      This character has the SIMPLEST face at the table.
      Dot eyes. Curved smile. Minimal features.
      
      According to McCloud's theory, simpler faces
      allow readers to PROJECT THEMSELVES into the character.
      
      This could be Donna (abstracted).
      This could be ANYONE.
      This is US at the table.
      
  richard_bartle:
    position: "Right-center"
    appearance:
      beard: "White, full"
      glasses: "Round, gold-rimmed"
      expression: "Thoughtful, processing"
      clothing: "Brown cardigan"
      accessory: "PIPE — smoke curling up!"
    drink: "Pint of ale, held mid-sip"
    
    interpretation: |
      Richard is the most DETAILED character at the table.
      
      Specific face. Specific beard. Specific glasses.
      He's NOT a mask — he's a SPECIFIC PERSON.
      
      This creates contrast with the masked figures.
      We project into the simple faces.
      We observe Richard as himself.
      
    pipe_emergence: |
      THE PIPE EMERGED!
      
      Not in the prompt. But it's PERFECT.
      Richard Bartle. Academic. Thoughtful.
      Of COURSE he has a pipe.
      
      The image understood character.
      
  masked_figure_2:
    position: "Right side"
    appearance:
      face: "Simple — dot eyes, neutral expression"
      color: "Orange"
      hat: "Green beanie/cap"
      clothing: "Green sweater"
    
    masking_analysis: |
      Another MASKED character.
      
      Green hat = possibly the instigator.
      But the face is simple enough to be ANYONE.
      
      The simpler the face, the more universal.
      
# LAYER 2: THE SETTING

layer_setting:
  pub_interior:
    walls: "Warm wood paneling"
    lighting: "Amber pendant lamps"
    fireplace: "Visible in background, flames dancing"
    atmosphere: "Cozy, warm, safe"
    
  the_table:
    material: "Dark wood, worn smooth"
    drinks_visible:
      - "Carrot juice (Don)"
      - "Pint of ale (Richard)"
      - "Pints (others)"
    snacks: "Small plate visible"
    
  background_details:
    clock: "Visible on wall"
    windows: "Evening blue outside"
    other_lamps: "Multiple, creating warm glow"
    
# LAYER 3: THE MASKING THEORY

layer_masking_theory:
  source: "Scott McCloud, 'Understanding Comics'"
  
  principle: |
    "The more cartoony a face, the more people it could be said to describe."
    
    Detailed faces = specific individuals
    Simple faces = universal, allows projection
    
  application_in_this_image:
    highly_detailed:
      - "Richard Bartle — specific person, observer"
      - "Don (rabbit) — specific form, but universal emotion"
    
    highly_abstracted:
      - "Orange figure with smile — could be anyone"
      - "Orange figure with green hat — could be anyone"
      
  effect: |
    The viewer becomes the masked characters.
    We sit at the table with Richard and Don.
    We're part of the fellowship.
    
    This is why the image WORKS.
    It's not four specific characters.
    It's two specific characters + US.

# LAYER 4: THE FELLOWSHIP

layer_fellowship:
  composition: "Four figures at a table"
  
  what_they_share:
    - "Survived the night"
    - "Witnessed impossible things"
    - "Found each other in the aftermath"
    - "Drinking together despite everything"
    
  mood: |
    Exhausted relief.
    Post-adventure decompression.
    The quiet after the storm.
    
    Nobody's talking about what happened.
    They don't need to.
    They were all THERE.
    
  the_silence: |
    The fireplace crackles.
    Someone takes a sip.
    The rabbit's ears twitch slightly.
    
    This is fellowship.
    Not loud. Not dramatic.
    Just... being together.
    After.

# LAYER 5: NARRATIVE ROLE

layer_narrative:

    - "Richard consumed by tunnel"
    - "Don's rabbit transformation"
    - "Building on fire"
    - "Donna's many selfies"
    
  this_moment:
    - "Everyone alive"
    - "Everyone together"
    - "Processing in silence"
    - "Finding equilibrium"
    
  leads_to:
    - "Richard's 'weather' observation"
    - "Donna's denouement"
    - "The open mic"
    - "The group selfie"
    
# HEISENBERGIAN RENDERING NOTE

layer_gender_fluidity:
  observation: |
    Note the MASKED orange figure (left-center).
    
    Is this Donna? The coloring suggests yes.
    But the features are SO simplified...
    
    This is Donna at MAXIMUM ABSTRACTION.
    Gender presentation: UNDEFINED.
    
    The masking effect means:
    - This could be anyone
    - This could be Donna in her most universal form
    - This is the SUPERPOSITION of Donna
    
    All genders. All expressions. All at once.
    Collapsed only when observed more closely.
