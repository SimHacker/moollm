    SOMEONE IS MAKING BUNNY EARS BEHIND RICHARD'S HEAD.
    
    After Don literally became a rabbit from trying this.
    After the Bunny Backfire was established as REAL.
    After Richard's saving throw bounced the spell.
    
    And now the INSTIGATOR is doing it to RICHARD.
    
    Has this person learned NOTHING?
    Or are they TEMPTING FATE?
    
    Chekhov's Bunny Ears: LOADED AGAIN.

  interpretation: |
    The selfie includes the mechanism of its own creation.
    We see the camera. We see its screen.
    We see the photo being taken as it's taken.
    
    This is self-referential documentation.
    The adventure documents itself documenting.

  possible_meanings:
    - "Donna's glasses are back on"
    - "The camera is back on"
    - "The chaos is back on (bunny ears)"
    - "The adventure continues"
    - "The magic is back on"
    
  best_interpretation: |
    Everything is "back on."
    
    The glasses. The fellowship. The jokes.
    Even the bunny ears curse, apparently.
    
    Nothing really ends at Lane Neverending.
    It just... continues.

layer_bunny_ears_foreshadowing:
  setup: |
    Don tried bunny ears on Richard → Became rabbit
    Richard's saving throw succeeded → Spell reflected
    Don is now permanently rabbit
    
  current_situation: |
    The instigator is making bunny ears on Richard.
    The same gesture. The same target.
    
  possibilities:
    - "Nothing happens (Richard is immune now)"
    - "Instigator becomes rabbit (pattern continues)"
    - "Richard becomes something else (spell stacks)"
    - "The dragon intervenes (again)"

    They went to the pub.
    They had drinks.
    Someone's making bunny ears again.
    
    The adventure never really ends.
    It just finds new equilibrium.
    
    Until someone does something stupid.
    (They always do.)
