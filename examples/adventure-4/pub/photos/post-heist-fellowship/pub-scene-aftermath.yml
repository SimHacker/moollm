# 🍺 THE NEVERENDING ARMS — Post-Heist Gathering
#
# Location: The pub at the end of Lane Neverending
# Time: Well past midnight, after the fire department left
# Mood: Exhausted relief, unlikely fellowship, warm amber light
#
# STYLE: Scott McCloud masking aesthetic
#   - More abstract faces (simple shapes allow projection)
#   - Pixar-adjacent warmth but simplified features
#   - Universal expressions through minimal detail
#   - The viewer becomes the characters
#
# "The more cartoony a face, the more people it could be said to describe."
#   — Scott McCloud, Understanding Comics

  atmosphere: |
    Warm amber light from mismatched lamps.
    Wood paneling, worn smooth by decades.
    The smell of smoke (both kinds) and comfort food.
    A fire in the hearth (ironic, given the evening).
    
    The kind of place where a rabbit in tie-dye,
    a distinguished academic, an orange security guard,
    and whoever else wanders in... all fit.
    
    Nobody judges at The Neverending Arms.
    They've seen weirder.

  donna_denouement:
    setup: |
      All night, Donna has been WATCHING.
      Documenting. Deploying. Celebrating.
      Content creator. Chaos conductor. Mushroom Queen.
      
      But now, in the pub, something shifts.
      
    the_moment: |
      Richard, still processing, turns to her.
      
      "You were watching the whole time. On those monitors."
      
      Donna nods. Sips her drink.
      
      "Did you... enjoy it?"
      
      A pause. The fire crackles.
      
      "I documented it. That's different."
      
      "Is it?"
      
      She looks at him. Really looks.
      The pink glasses come off.
      
      "...No. I enjoyed it. All of it.
       The anvils. The rockets. The THWACK.
       Even the fire. Even you getting... taken.
       
       I'm not supposed to say that out loud."
       
      Richard considers this. The academic processing.
      
      "You know... in game design, we call that
       the 'killer' player type. Someone who enjoys
       affecting others in the world."
       
      Donna stiffens. Then:
      
      "Is that bad?"
      
      Richard shakes his head. Sips his drink.
      
      "It's necessary. Without killers, the world is static.
       Nothing happens. Nothing changes.
       Achievers need opposition. Explorers need danger.
       
       You're not evil. You're... weather.
       Weather doesn't apologize for storms."
       
      Donna is quiet for a long moment.
      
      Then, slowly, she smiles.
      Not the content creator smile.
      Not the triumph smile.
      
      Something realer. Softer. Seen.
      
      "Weather. I can live with weather."
      
    aftermath: |
      She doesn't take a selfie of this moment.
      Some things aren't content.
      Some things are just... true.
      
      But she does order another round.
      For everyone.
      Even the rabbit.
