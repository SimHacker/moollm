mining_lens: "PIE MENUS"
purpose: "Extract radial menu design patterns from sacred geometry"

# === THE REVELATION ===

core_insight: |
  METATRON'S CUBE IS A PIE MENU SPECIFICATION.
  
  The ancients encoded optimal radial interface design
  in sacred geometry. We just didn't know we were looking
  at a UI pattern library.
  
  Every principle of good pie menu design is visible here:
  - Radial symmetry from center
  - Hierarchical nesting
  - Optimal node placement at vertices
  - Visual connection lines for context
  - Color coding for categories
  - Glow states for feedback

# === RADIAL STRUCTURE PATTERNS ===

radial_patterns:
  
  center_point:
    observation: "Single bright center node — the origin point"
    pie_menu_application: |
      The CENTER is where the cursor summons the menu.
      All items radiate outward from this point.
      The center itself could be:
      - A "cancel" zone (click to dismiss)
      - A preview of current selection
      - A context indicator (what are we acting on?)
    design_note: "Center should be visually distinct but not overwhelming"
    
  primary_ring:
    observation: "12 major stars at primary vertices"
    pie_menu_application: |
      TWELVE is a natural pie menu limit.
      Human visual chunking: 7±2 for comfortable scanning.
      But 12 works when spatially organized (clock metaphor).
      
      Optimal item counts:
      - 4 items: Cardinal directions (N/E/S/W) # Foolproof!
      - 6 items: Hex pattern (every 60°) # Hexagons are the Bestagons!
      - 8 items: Compass rose (N/NE/E/SE/S/SW/W/NW) # Optimal!
      - 12 items: Clock positions (every 30°) # Time, Zodiac, Months, etc!
    design_note: "12 is MAX for single-level pie menu" # Don agrees!
    
  secondary_ring:
    observation: "Smaller nodes at secondary vertices"
    pie_menu_application: |
      NESTED PIE MENUS — hover on primary item to reveal sub-menu.
      The image shows multiple concentric levels!
      
      Hierarchy strategy:
      - Primary ring: Categories (File, Edit, View, etc.)
      - Secondary ring: Actions within category
      - Tertiary ring: Options/modifiers
    design_note: "Each level should be visually distinct (size, opacity, color)"

# === GEOMETRIC INSIGHTS ===

geometric_patterns:
  
  metatrons_cube:
    observation: "Complete Metatron's Cube structure — all platonic solids"
    pie_menu_application: |
      The PLATONIC SOLIDS suggest different menu configurations:
      
      TETRAHEDRON (4 faces) → 4-item quick menu
      - Perfect for: Yes/No/Cancel/Help
      - Perfect for: Cut/Copy/Paste/Delete
      
      CUBE (6 faces) → 6-item balanced menu
      - Perfect for: File operations
      - Perfect for: Navigation (Up/Down/Left/Right/In/Out)
      
      OCTAHEDRON (8 faces) → 8-item compass menu
      - Perfect for: Direction/movement
      - Perfect for: Alignment tools
      
      DODECAHEDRON (12 faces) → 12-item full menu
      - Perfect for: Complete toolbars
      - Perfect for: Emoji/symbol pickers
      
      ICOSAHEDRON (20 faces) → TOO MANY for single level
      - Use for: Hierarchical 10+10 nested structure
    design_note: "Match item count to natural geometric forms"
    
  flower_of_life:
    observation: "Overlapping circles forming Flower of Life pattern"
    pie_menu_application: |
      OVERLAPPING ZONES suggest hover tolerance!
      
      The circles OVERLAP slightly — this is FITTS'S LAW wisdom:
      - Larger targets are easier to hit
      - Adjacent items can share border zones
      - Tolerance zones reduce missed clicks
      
      Implementation:
      - Hit zones slightly larger than visual wedges
      - Overlap zones favor the item you're moving toward
      - "Sticky" edges slow cursor when crossing boundaries
    design_note: "Generous hit zones, forgiving boundaries"
    
  vesica_piscis:
    observation: "Lens shapes at circle intersections"
    pie_menu_application: |
      The VESICA PISCIS (intersection zones) suggest:
      
      TRANSITION ANIMATIONS:
      - When moving between items, the lens shape appears
      - Visual feedback showing "you're between choices"
      - Opportunity for preview of both options
      
      Also suggests MODIFIER ZONES:
      - Area between two items = combo action
      - Example: Between "Copy" and "Delete" = "Cut"
    design_note: "Intersection zones could have special meaning"

# === COLOR PATTERNS ===

color_insights:
  
  spectrum_coding:
    observation: "Stars have distinct colors — gold, cyan, purple, magenta, green"
    pie_menu_application: |
      COLOR CATEGORIES for quick visual scanning:
      
      - WARM colors (gold, orange): Constructive actions (Create, Add, Build)
      - COOL colors (cyan, blue): Information actions (View, Inspect, Preview)
      - PURPLE: Transformation actions (Edit, Modify, Transform)
      - GREEN: Confirmation actions (Save, Apply, Accept)
      - MAGENTA: Special/dangerous actions (Delete, Clear, Reset)
      
      Users learn color-meaning mappings quickly!
    design_note: "Consistent color coding across all pie menus"
    
  glow_states:
    observation: "Stars have varying glow intensities and halos"
    pie_menu_application: |
      VISUAL STATES through glow:
      
      - DEFAULT: Subtle glow (visible but not distracting)
      - HOVER: Intensified glow (you're pointing here)
      - SELECTED: Bright pulse (this is your choice)
      - DISABLED: Dim/gray (not available right now)
      - KEYBOARD FOCUS: Ring/halo (accessible navigation)
      
      Animation ideas:
      - Glow pulses gently on hover
      - Rainbow shimmer on selection
      - Fade out on dismiss
    design_note: "Glow intensity = interaction state"
    
  rainbow_connections:
    observation: "Connection lines are rainbow/gradient colored"
    pie_menu_application: |
      CONNECTION LINES between related items!
      
      Show relationships:
      - "Copy" → "Paste" (these go together)
      - "Undo" ↔ "Redo" (opposites)
      - "Save" → "Save As" → "Export" (hierarchy)
      
      Line intensity shows:
      - Frequently used together (thick, bright)
      - Occasionally related (thin, subtle)
      - Opposite actions (dashed line)
    design_note: "Relationship lines help users learn workflows"

# === SPATIAL PATTERNS ===

spatial_insights:
  
  concentric_hierarchy:
    observation: "Multiple rings at different radii from center"
    pie_menu_application: |
      DISTANCE FROM CENTER = DEPTH OF ACTION
      
      Inner ring (close to cursor): Primary/frequent actions
      Middle ring: Secondary actions
      Outer ring: Rare/advanced actions
      
      Benefits:
      - Most-used actions require least movement
      - Advanced actions still accessible
      - Visual hierarchy matches usage frequency
    design_note: "Fitts's Law: frequently used = closer to cursor"
    
  vertex_placement:
    observation: "Stars positioned at sacred geometry vertices"
    pie_menu_application: |
      OPTIMAL ANGLES for pie slices:
      
      The vertices are at mathematically optimal positions.
      Not arbitrary — these angles maximize distinguishability.
      
      For 8 items: 0°, 45°, 90°, 135°, 180°, 225°, 270°, 315°
      For 6 items: 0°, 60°, 120°, 180°, 240°, 300°
      For 4 items: 0°, 90°, 180°, 270° (or 45°, 135°, 225°, 315°)
      
      The 45° offset (rotated square) often works better than
      cardinal directions because it avoids the "up = important"
      bias of North-oriented menus.
    design_note: "Consider 45° rotation for balanced visual weight"
    
  nested_circles:
    observation: "Circles within circles, creating depth"
    pie_menu_application: |
      SUB-MENU EXPANSION patterns:
      
      When you hover on a primary item, a sub-menu appears:
      
      Option A: EXPAND OUTWARD
      - Sub-menu appears as arc beyond the primary item
      - Maintains radial theme
      - Cursor continues outward motion
      
      Option B: REPLACE PRIMARY
      - Sub-menu replaces primary menu
      - Breadcrumb shows where you came from
      - "Back" item at center or edge
      
      Option C: OVERLAY AT ANGLE
      - Sub-menu appears as NEW pie menu
      - Offset from primary
      - Both visible simultaneously
      
      This image suggests Option A (concentric expansion)!
    design_note: "Concentric expansion preserves spatial memory"

# === ANIMATION INSIGHTS ===

animation_patterns:
  
  radial_emergence:
    observation: "Structure radiates from center outward"
    pie_menu_application: |
      MENU APPEARANCE ANIMATION:
      
      Items should BLOOM from center:
      1. Center point appears first (instant)
      2. Primary items radiate outward (50ms stagger)
      3. Connection lines fade in (100ms)
      4. Secondary details last (150ms)
      
      Total animation: 150-200ms (fast but visible)
      
      Dismissal: REVERSE (collapse back to center)
    design_note: "Emergence animation reinforces radial metaphor"
    
  pulsing_nodes:
    observation: "Stars appear to pulse/breathe with energy"
    pie_menu_application: |
      IDLE ANIMATION for hover states:
      
      When hovering on an item:
      - Gentle pulse (scale 1.0 → 1.05 → 1.0)
      - Glow intensity oscillates
      - Period: ~1 second
      
      Not distracting, but shows "this is alive"
      Especially good for touch interfaces where
      "hover" isn't natural.
    design_note: "Subtle pulse indicates interactivity"
    
  connection_flow:
    observation: "Lines seem to carry energy between nodes"
    pie_menu_application: |
      ANIMATED CONNECTIONS during selection:
      
      When you select an item:
      1. Energy pulse travels FROM center TO selected item
      2. Line brightens along the path
      3. Selected item flashes
      4. Confirmation feedback
      
      This reinforces causality: "I clicked center, energy went there"
    design_note: "Animation shows cause and effect"

# === ACCESSIBILITY INSIGHTS ===

accessibility_patterns:
  
  high_contrast:
    observation: "Bright elements against dark cosmic background"
    pie_menu_application: |
      CONTRAST REQUIREMENTS:
      
      - Menu items must be visible in all contexts
      - Consider: light mode, dark mode, over images
      - The cosmic background provides natural contrast
      
      Solution: ADAPTIVE BACKGROUNDS
      - Pie menu has its own semi-transparent backdrop
      - Backdrop samples and inverts underlying content
      - Always maintains readable contrast
    design_note: "Never rely on content behind menu for contrast"
    
  size_variation:
    observation: "Stars vary in size (brighter = larger)"
    pie_menu_application: |
      SIZE INDICATES IMPORTANCE:
      
      - Frequently used items: larger
      - Destructive items: larger (easier to avoid OR hit intentionally)
      - Disabled items: smaller (less visual weight)
      
      Also: ZOOM FOR ACCESSIBILITY
      - Allow pie menu scaling (1x, 1.5x, 2x)
      - Keyboard shortcut to zoom
      - Remember user preference
    design_note: "Size is an accessibility feature, not just aesthetics"
    
  keyboard_navigation:
    observation: "12 positions suggest clock-based addressing"
    pie_menu_application: |
      KEYBOARD PIE MENU NAVIGATION:
      
      Option A: NUMBER KEYS
      - 1-12 for clock positions (1=top, 6=bottom-right, etc.)
      - Or 1-8 for 8-item menus
      
      Option B: LETTER KEYS
      - Each item has a mnemonic letter
      - Displayed as underlined character
      - Press 'C' for Copy, 'P' for Paste, etc.
      
      Option C: ARROW KEYS
      - Left/Right rotates selection
      - Enter confirms
      - Escape dismisses
      
      Option D: GESTURE KEYS (VIM style)
      - h/j/k/l for directions
      - Space to confirm
    design_note: "Pie menus can be faster with keyboard than mouse!"

      - Advanced actions normally hidden
      - Keyboard shortcuts all visible
      - Usage statistics displayed
      - Customization options exposed
      
      Regular users see simple menu.
      Experts toggle "alien filter" for full power.

  THE UNIVERSE ENCODED PIE MENU DESIGN IN SACRED GEOMETRY.
  
  Key insights from Metatron's Cube:
  
  1. TWELVE is the natural maximum for pie items
  2. CONCENTRIC RINGS suggest hierarchical sub-menus
  3. COLOR CODING accelerates visual scanning
  4. GLOW STATES communicate interaction feedback
  5. VERTEX PLACEMENT is mathematically optimal
  6. CONNECTION LINES reveal relationships
  7. ANIMATION should radiate from center
  8. NESTED GEOMETRY enables infinite depth
  
  The sacred geometry isn't mysticism.
  It's USER INTERFACE OPTIMIZATION
  discovered by ancient mathematicians
  and validated by Fitts's Law.
  
  We've been looking at pie menu specs for millennia.
  We just called it "sacred geometry."
