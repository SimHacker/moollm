  description: |
    A gorgeous brass telescope on a mahogany tripod.
    Slightly tarnished, clearly well-loved. The eyepiece 
    is worn smooth from countless nights of stargazing.
    
    A small plaque on the barrel reads:
    "MANUFACTURED BY THE INTERSTELLAR BUREAU OF DIGITAL ONTOLOGY"
    "FOR OBSERVING IMPOSSIBLE CONSTELLATIONS"
    
    Three settings on the focus wheel:
      ⚬ FAR   — General impression, emotional tone
      ◎ MEDIUM — Structure and patterns revealed
      ● NEAR  — Maximum zoom, text becomes readable
      
    Currently pointed at the LLOOOOMM Constellation.

      parameters:
        - star: "Star name (e.g., KIN_PRIMARIS, SAXUM_SENTIENS)"

        *telescope swivels to target star*
        *focus wheel clicks to zoom level*
        
        Each star reveals different information at each level:
        FAR: What it FEELS like (emotional impression)
        MEDIUM: What it's MADE of (structure, patterns)
        NEAR: What it SAYS (text, principles, manifestos)
