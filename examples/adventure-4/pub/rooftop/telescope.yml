    A gorgeous brass telescope on a mahogany tripod.
    Slightly tarnished, clearly well-loved. The eyepiece 
    is worn smooth from countless nights of stargazing.
    
    A small plaque on the barrel reads:
    "MANUFACTURED BY THE INTERSTELLAR BUREAU OF DIGITAL ONTOLOGY"
    "FOR OBSERVING IMPOSSIBLE CONSTELLATIONS"
    
    Three settings on the focus wheel:
      ⚬ FAR   — General impression, emotional tone
      ◎ MEDIUM — Structure and patterns revealed
      ● NEAR  — Maximum zoom, text becomes readable
      
    Currently pointed at the LLOOOOMM Constellation.
