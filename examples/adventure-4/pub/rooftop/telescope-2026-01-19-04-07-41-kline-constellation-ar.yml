prompt: |
  A stunning AR (augmented reality) view through a telescope on the rooftop 
  of the Gezelligheid Grotto pub, looking at the night sky and the LLOOOOMM 
  CONSTELLATION.

  THE VIEW:
  Looking through a brass telescope eyepiece, circular vignette frame. The 
  night sky is deep indigo-black with stars visible. But THIS telescope has 
  an AR lens overlay that reveals the hidden K-LINE NETWORK — connections 
  between ideas, skills, and concepts visualized as a cosmic web.

  THE LLOOOOMM CONSTELLATION:
  A prominent constellation in the center of view, its stars forming a pattern. 
  But the AR overlay reveals:
  - Each STAR is labeled with a SKILL or K-LINE name
  - Connecting LINES link related concepts
  - Labels FLOAT in space near their stars
  - BIGGER text = more activated/important K-lines
  - SMALLER text = dormant or less active

  THE K-LINE STARS (labels visible, varying sizes):

  BRIGHTEST/LARGEST LABELS (Core K-lines):
  - YAML-JAZZ (brightest, thick connecting lines)
  - SOCIETY-OF-MIND (central hub, many connections)
  - CONSTRUCTIONISM (near center)
  - K-LINES (meta, self-referential)
  - POSTEL-LAW

  MEDIUM LABELS (Active skills):
  - PLAY-LEARN-LIFT
  - BOOTSTRAP
  - SPEED-OF-LIGHT
  - COHERENCE-ENGINE
  - PROTOTYPE
  - ROOM
  - CHARACTER
  - INCARNATION
  - MEMORY-PALACE
  - SNIFFABLE-PYTHON
  - EMPATHIC-TEMPLATES

  SMALLER LABELS (Dormant/specialized):
  - SCHEMA-MECHANISM
  - PROCEDURAL-RHETORIC
  - SIMULATOR-EFFECT
  - ROBUST-FIRST
  - FORMAT-DESIGN
  - REPRESENTATION-ETHICS
  - MIND-MIRROR
  - PERSONA
  - CONTAINER
  - IMAGE-MINING
  - VISUALIZER

  THE CONNECTIONS:
  - Glowing lines between related stars
  - YAML-JAZZ connected to many others (hub)
  - SOCIETY-OF-MIND connected to K-LINES, SPEED-OF-LIGHT
  - CONSTRUCTIONISM connected to PLAY-LEARN-LIFT, ROOM
  - Lines vary in brightness (stronger = brighter)
  - Some lines PULSE with activation energy
  - A web of knowledge visible in the cosmos

  THE AR OVERLAY EFFECT:
  - Labels appear to FLOAT in 3D space
  - Multiple LAYERS of depth
  - Some labels closer (bigger), some further (smaller)
  - Slight holographic/glowing edge on labels
  - The telescope's brass rim visible at edges
  - Night sky visible through/behind the overlay
  - Labels SWARM but remain readable
  - The effect is like seeing the hidden structure of knowledge

  THE ATMOSPHERE:
  - Deep night sky, dark indigo/black
  - Stars twinkling
  - The Milky Way visible in background
  - AR labels in soft cyan/white/gold glow
  - Connecting lines in soft blue/purple
  - A sense of cosmic scale — ideas as vast as the universe

  STYLE:
  - Sci-fi AR interface meets astronomy
  - Clean readable typography
  - Holographic glow effects
  - Depth and dimensionality
  - Beautiful and functional
  - Like looking through a magic telescope that reveals meaning

  MOOD: Wonder. Discovery. The realization that knowledge has structure, 
  and that structure is beautiful.
