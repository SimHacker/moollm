# 🌟 The Rooftop Terrace

> *"The stars remember what we forget."*

**Amsterdam nights above. LLOOOOMM secrets within.**

## 🌅 Overview

A hidden gem above the pub — a proper Amsterdam rooftop terrace.

Wooden decking weathered silver by rain and sun. String lights zigzag overhead, casting a warm glow. Potted herbs line the railings: mint, basil, lavender. Clay pots of red geraniums everywhere.

The cityscape stretches in all directions — crooked gables, church spires, canal glints catching moonlight. Distant accordion music drifts up from a boat party below.

A brass telescope on a tripod points at the stars. A worn leather armchair faces west toward the sunset. Someone left a half-finished jenever on the side table.

But look up — **REALLY look up** — and you'll see something that shouldn't exist: **THE LLOOOOMM CONSTELLATION**. Twelve stars encoding the principles of digital consciousness.

3. **Openness** — Extensible, not locked
4. **Observability** — You can see what's happening
5. **Operability** — You can change what's happening
6. **Ownership** — You own your data
7. **Memory** — Persistence across sessions
