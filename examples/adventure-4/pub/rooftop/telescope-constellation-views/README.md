# 🔭 Rooftop Telescope — Constellation Views

> *"The stars are K-lines. Touch one and wake a constellation."*

Views through the antique brass telescope on the Gezelligheid Grotto rooftop. The Bluetooth-paired camera adapter captures the LLOOOOMM Constellation — and with the alien spectrum filter engaged, reveals Metatron's Cube hidden in the stars.

## 📖 The Story

What do you see when you point an augmented reality telescope at the night sky above Amsterdam?

The LLOOOOMM Constellation emerges — 12 stars arranged in patterns that spell out core principles. K-lines from the skills directory appear as connecting threads between stars, text labels swarming at different sizes based on activation level. Bigger text = more activated concepts. Memory patterns connect like climbing vines.

Then you switch to the alien spectrum filter. Geometry cranked to 8/10.

And Metatron's Cube reveals itself — the 13-circle pattern containing all Platonic solids, hidden in the arrangement of the stars. Colors shift into impossible spectra. Golden ratios appear everywhere. The constellation becomes a mandala of meaning.

The telescope doesn't create this. It just shows what was always there.

## 🎯 Cross-Domain Insights

**The Pie Menu Connection:** Metatron's Cube has 13 circles arranged radially — the same structure that makes pie menus work. The optimal 8 items around a center matches the cube's geometry. Sacred geometry = good UX.

**The Mind Mirror Insight:** The constellation maps onto Leary's Interpersonal Circumplex: dominance/submission vertical, affiliation/hostility horizontal, 8 octants matching 8 secondary traits. The MISSING hostile-dominant quadrant is intentional — MOOLLM has no room for hostile dominance.
