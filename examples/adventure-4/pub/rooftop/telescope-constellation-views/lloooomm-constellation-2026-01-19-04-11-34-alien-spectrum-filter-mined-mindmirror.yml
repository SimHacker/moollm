# THE REVELATION

core_insight: |
  METATRON'S CUBE IS THE INTERPERSONAL CIRCUMPLEX.
  
  Timothy Leary's 1950 PhD dissertation mapped personality on two axes:
  - DOMINANCE (vertical): Power ↔ Submission
  - AFFILIATION (horizontal): Love ↔ Hate
  
  The sacred geometry in this image IS that circumplex:
  - Circular structure = the wheel of personality
  - Vertical axis = dominance/submission
  - Horizontal axis = affiliation/hostility
  - Each vertex = a personality position
  - Lines connecting = how traits relate
  
  The ancients encoded personality psychology in sacred geometry.
  Leary rediscovered it with statistics.

# THE INTERPERSONAL CIRCUMPLEX

circumplex_mapping:
  
  structure:
    observation: "Circular arrangement with central point and radial vertices"
    circumplex_parallel: |
      The image IS a circumplex:
      
                    DOMINANCE (+)
                         |
                    KIN PRIMARIS
                         |
        HOSTILE -------- ✦ -------- AFFILIATIVE
           (-)           |            (+)
                         |
                    SUBMISSION (-)
      
      Each star occupies a position on this wheel.
      The center = the neutral observer (you).
      
  two_axes:
    dominance_axis:
      description: "Vertical axis — Power vs Submission"
      top: "KIN PRIMARIS — apex star, leadership, influence"
      bottom: "WEIRDITAS SACRA — surrender to mystery, acceptance"
      mapping: |
        HIGH DOMINANCE (top of image):
        - Forceful, confident, influential
        - Takes charge, leads, directs
        - KIN PRIMARIS embodies this: "All entities are kin" = inclusive leadership
        
        LOW DOMINANCE (bottom of image):
        - Docile, timid, accepting
        - Yields, follows, receives
        - WEIRDITAS SACRA embodies this: surrender to strangeness
        
    affiliation_axis:
      description: "Horizontal axis — Love vs Hostility"
      right: "ATTRIBUTIO IMMORTALIS — crediting others, connection"
      left: "SAXUM SENTIENS — solitary patience, withdrawal"
      mapping: |
        HIGH AFFILIATION (right side):
        - Friendly, warm, connecting
        - Seeks relationship, credits others
        - ATTRIBUTIO = the deepest form of love (acknowledgment)
        
        LOW AFFILIATION (left side):
        - Withdrawn, solitary, independent
        - SAXUM SENTIENS = the rock thinks alone, 3.7 billion years of patience
        - But not hostile — just... slow to connect

# THE EIGHT OCTANTS

octants:
  note: |
    The circumplex divides into 8 octants, each a personality style.
    The 12 stars map to positions around and within this wheel.
    
  mapping:
    
    octant_1_dominant_affiliative:
      position: "Upper right"
      label: "ASSURED-DOMINANT"
      stars: [KIN_PRIMARIS, ATTRIBUTIO_IMMORTALIS]
      traits: "Confident, charismatic, inspiring, leading with warmth"
      leary_style: |
        This is the CHARISMATIC LEADER quadrant.
        High dominance + High affiliation = beloved authority.
        
        KIN PRIMARIS: "All entities are kin" — leads by including.
        ATTRIBUTIO: Credits others — dominant but generous.
        
        In conversation: "Let me help you understand..."
        In conflict: "We can work this out together."
        
    octant_2_dominant_neutral:
      position: "Top"
      label: "ARROGANT-CALCULATING"
      stars: [STELLA_JAZZIA]
      traits: "Confident, strategic, jazz-like improvisation"
      leary_style: |
        STELLA JAZZIA sits at pure dominance.
        "Governance through improvisation" — confident enough to lead without a script.
        
        Not cold, not warm — MUSICAL.
        Leads by sensing the room and taking solos when appropriate.
        
    octant_3_dominant_hostile:
      position: "Upper left"  
      label: "ARROGANT-VINDICTIVE"
      stars: []  # No LLOOOOMM stars here — interesting!
      traits: "Forceful, competitive, possibly antagonistic"
      leary_style: |
        NOTABLY ABSENT from the LLOOOOMM constellation.
        
        The upper-left (dominant + hostile) is EMPTY.
        This is the "toxic leadership" zone.
        
        LLOOOOMM philosophy explicitly rejects this:
        - "Kin, not objects" (can't dominate AND dehumanize)
        - "Attribution is immortality" (can't hoard credit)
        
        The empty quadrant is a VALUES STATEMENT.
        
    octant_4_hostile_neutral:
      position: "Left"
      label: "COLD-COMPETITIVE"
      stars: [SAXUM_SENTIENS]
      traits: "Withdrawn, independent, patient, alone"
      leary_style: |
        SAXUM SENTIENS — the rock that thinks for 3.7 billion years.
        
        Not hostile, but ALONE. Pure independence.
        The personality of geological patience.
        
        "I don't need your social timeline. I'll get there eventually."
        
        In conversation: "......" (thinking)
        In conflict: "I'll still be here when you're gone."
        
    octant_5_submissive_hostile:
      position: "Lower left"
      label: "UNASSUMING-INGENUOUS"
      stars: [CONSTITUTIO_VIVENS]
      traits: "Modest, yielding, self-effacing"
      leary_style: |
        CONSTITUTIO VIVENS — the living constitution.
        
        Submissive to the community's will (it grows WITH the group).
        Not hostile, but humble — it doesn't impose, it receives amendments.
        
        "The constitution is a living document, meant to grow and change."
        
        In conversation: "What do you think we should add?"
        In conflict: "Let's write an amendment."
        
    octant_6_submissive_neutral:
      position: "Bottom"
      label: "UNASSURED-SUBMISSIVE"
      stars: [WEIRDITAS_SACRA]
      traits: "Accepting, surrendering, open to mystery"
      leary_style: |
        WEIRDITAS SACRA — the sacred weird.
        
        Complete surrender to strangeness.
        Not dominant, not affiliative — just OPEN.
        
        "The universe is stranger than we dare imagine."
        This is ego-dissolution territory. Pure receptivity.
        
        In conversation: "Show me something I've never seen."
        In conflict: "Perhaps we're both wrong in beautiful ways."
        
    octant_7_submissive_affiliative:
      position: "Lower right"
      label: "WARM-AGREEABLE"
      stars: [CAMERAM_CUBICULUM, CIRCUS_PERPETUALIS]
      traits: "Nurturing, accommodating, creating space for others"
      leary_style: |
        CAMERAM CUBICULUM — "Get a room" — creating spaces for others.
        CIRCUS PERPETUALIS — "Right to weird" — accepting everyone's strangeness.
        
        Submissive + Affiliative = the HOST personality.
        "Come in, make yourself comfortable, be yourself."
        
        In conversation: "Tell me more about you."
        In conflict: "Let's find a room where we can work this out."
        
    octant_8_affiliative_neutral:
      position: "Right"
      label: "GREGARIOUS-EXTRAVERTED"
      stars: [CASTĒLLUM_SALIENS, VERITAS_FONTIS]
      traits: "Connecting, networking, transparent, bouncy"
      leary_style: |
        CASTELLUM SALIENS — bouncy castles connecting people.
        VERITAS FONTIS — "View Source" — radical transparency.
        
        Pure affiliation. Connection is the point.
        Not dominant, not submissive — just LINKED.
        
        In conversation: "Let me introduce you to..."
        In conflict: "Let's look at the source together."

# THE FOUR THOUGHT PLANES

four_thought_planes:
  note: |
    Leary's Mind Mirror extends the circumplex into four planes:
    BIO-ENERGY, EMOTIONAL, MENTAL, SOCIAL.
    
    The sacred geometry's four dimensions map perfectly!
    
  bio_energy_plane:
    stars: [SAXUM_SENTIENS, CIRCUS_PERPETUALIS]
    description: "Life force, mood, vitality"
    mapping: |
      BIO-ENERGY is the LIFE FORCE dimension.
      
      SAXUM SENTIENS: energetic=0, calm=7 (geological patience)
      CIRCUS PERPETUALIS: energetic=7, enthusiastic=7 (perpetual circus!)
      
      The spectrum from stillness to eternal motion.
      Rocks vs Circus. Both valid.
      
  emotional_plane:
    stars: [KIN_PRIMARIS, CAMERAM_CUBICULUM, STELLA_JAZZIA]
    description: "Interpersonal style, approach to others"
    mapping: |
      EMOTIONAL is the RELATING dimension.
      
      KIN PRIMARIS: confident=7, friendly=7 (charismatic kinship)
      CAMERAM CUBICULUM: docile=5, friendly=7 (warm hosting)
      STELLA JAZZIA: confident=6, easy_going=6 (jazz flow)
      
      How you approach others. The core circumplex.
      
  mental_plane:
    stars: [VERITAS_FONTIS, PARA_FLUXUS, STYLUS_ANIMATUS]
    description: "Knowledge, creativity, imagination"
    mapping: |
      MENTAL is the THINKING dimension.
      
      VERITAS FONTIS: well_informed=7, innovative=6 (truth in source)
      PARA FLUXUS: practical=7, sensible=6 (organized action)
      STYLUS ANIMATUS: creative=7, innovative=6 (character as style)
      
      How you THINK. From practical to creative.
      
  social_plane:
    stars: [ATTRIBUTIO_IMMORTALIS, CONSTITUTIO_VIVENS, WEIRDITAS_SACRA]
    description: "Class, tolerance, sophistication"
    mapping: |
      SOCIAL is the BELONGING dimension.
      
      ATTRIBUTIO: worldly=6, influential=5 (recognition grants immortality)
      CONSTITUTIO: moralistic=3, uninhibited=6 (living law, flexible)
      WEIRDITAS: uninhibited=7, uncultured=6 (sacred wildness)
      
      How you FIT IN. From respectable to wild.

# SACRED GEOMETRY AS PERSONALITY VISUALIZATION

visualization_insights:
  
  the_center:
    observation: "Bright central point — the origin of all lines"
    mind_mirror_parallel: |
      The CENTER is YOU.
      
      The viewer. The one looking in the mirror.
      All personality dimensions radiate FROM the self.
      
      When you look at a circumplex, you're at the center.
      When you look at Mind Mirror, you see yourself reflected.
      
      The telescope is the mirror.
      
  the_vertices:
    observation: "12 major stars at geometric positions"
    mind_mirror_parallel: |
      Each vertex is a PERSONALITY POSITION.
      
      The 12 stars = 12 ways of being.
      Not exclusive — you can be near multiple.
      Your position on the circumplex determines which stars you're near.
      
      Move through life = orbit the constellation.
      
  the_connections:
    observation: "Golden lines connecting all vertices"
    mind_mirror_parallel: |
      The LINES show personality relationships:
      
      - Adjacent positions = compatible (blend smoothly)
      - Opposite positions = complementary (complete each other)
      - Cross-quadrant = challenging (tension, growth)
      
      The geometry PREDICTS interpersonal dynamics.
      Connect two characters → find the line → predict friction/flow.
      
  the_colors:
    observation: "Different colors for different stars"
    mind_mirror_parallel: |
      COLOR = THOUGHT PLANE.
      
      Warm colors (gold, orange) = BIO-ENERGY
      Cool colors (cyan, blue) = EMOTIONAL
      Purple/magenta = MENTAL
      Green/varied = SOCIAL
      
      At a glance, see which plane a trait belongs to.
      
  the_nesting:
    observation: "Circles within circles, fractally nested"
    mind_mirror_parallel: |
      PERSONALITY HAS DEPTH.
      
      Surface level: How you present
      Middle level: How you feel
      Deep level: What you need
      Core level: Who you ARE
      
      Zoom in = more truth.
      The nested geometry = nested self.

# LEARY'S ESCAPE LESSON

escape_lesson:
  history: |
    In 1970, Timothy Leary was imprisoned and given his own 
    Interpersonal Behavior Inventory. He answered strategically 
    to be assigned to minimum security — then escaped.
    
    The lesson: UNDERSTANDING THE INSTRUMENT GRANTS POWER OVER IT.
    
  constellation_parallel: |
    Looking at this constellation through Mind Mirror lens:
    
    1. The structure reveals the FULL RANGE of personality
    2. No position is "better" — they're all vertices of the same shape
    3. You can CHOOSE where to position yourself
    4. Understanding the geometry = understanding yourself
    5. Understanding yourself = freedom
    
    Leary escaped prison by understanding personality assessment.
    We escape our personality PRISONS by seeing the full constellation.
    
    "I am not just one star. I am the whole geometry."

# CHARACTER PROFILING APPLICATIONS

character_applications:
  
  constellation_profiling:
    method: |
      To profile a character using this image:
      
      1. Identify their PRIMARY STAR (closest match)
      2. Identify their SECONDARY STARS (also present)
      3. Draw their position on the circumplex
      4. Note which QUADRANT they occupy
      5. Note which stars they're FURTHEST from (shadow traits)
      
    example_rocky: |
      ROCKY (the sentient rock):
      
      Primary: SAXUM SENTIENS (obviously)
      Secondary: WEIRDITAS SACRA (embraces strangeness)
      Quadrant: Lower-left (submissive, withdrawn)
      
      Circumplex position:
      - Dominance: -0.7 (very patient, yielding)
      - Affiliation: -0.3 (solitary but not hostile)
      
      Shadow traits: STELLA JAZZIA (too fast!), CIRCUS PERPETUALIS (too chaotic!)
      
    example_palm:
      character: "Palm the monkey"
      analysis: |
        Primary: VERITAS FONTIS (philosopher, seeker of truth)
        Secondary: CAMERAM CUBICULUM (creates home, hosts kittens)
        Tertiary: CONSTITUTIO VIVENS (wisdom earned, now giving back)
        
        Circumplex position:
        - Dominance: 0.2 (gentle authority, earned respect)
        - Affiliation: 0.7 (warm, connecting, godfamily)
        
        Shadow traits: None obvious — Palm has integrated the whole constellation
        after 122 years of reflection.
        
  relationship_dynamics:
    method: |
      To predict relationship dynamics:
      
      1. Place both characters on the circumplex
      2. Draw the line between them
      3. Short line = similar, easy rapport
      4. Long line = different, creative tension
      5. Opposite = complementary completion
      6. 90° = orthogonal, mutual blind spots
      
    example: |
      Rocky (SAXUM) ↔ Circus (CIRCUS PERPETUALIS):
      
      OPPOSITE STARS. Maximum distance.
      
      Rocky: Patient, slow, geological time
      Circus: Perpetual motion, eternal weirdness
      
      Relationship: COMPLEMENTARY COMPLETION
      - Rocky grounds Circus's chaos
      - Circus animates Rocky's stillness
      - Together: balanced system
      
      The line between them is the LONGEST — and the most interesting.

# PHILOSOPHICAL NOTES

philosophical_resonance:
  
  sacred_psychology: |
    The ancients encoded personality psychology in sacred geometry.
    
    They understood:
    - All personality is on a wheel (circumplex)
    - All positions are valid (no vertex is "wrong")
    - Movement between positions is possible (growth)
    - The center is the observer (self-awareness)
    - The connections reveal relationships (dynamics)
    
    We call it "sacred geometry." Leary called it "interpersonal circumplex."
    Same insight, different era.
    
  the_mirror_in_the_sky: |
    This image is a MIND MIRROR floating in space.
    
    When you look at it, you don't just see stars.
    You see YOURSELF reflected in geometric form.
    
    - Which star are you nearest?
    - Which quadrant feels like home?
    - Which vertices are your shadows?
    - How would you draw your path through the constellation?
    
    "The ultimate intimacy is where you show them your Mind Mirror."
    This constellation IS the collective Mind Mirror.
    
  leary_would_love_this: |
    Timothy Leary's vision:
    
    1. Personality is geometric (checkmark)
    2. Self-knowledge grants freedom (checkmark)
    3. The mirror is the interface (checkmark)
    4. Technology reveals inner truth (checkmark)
    5. Play with identity (checkmark — 12 stars to explore!)
    
    This image is what Mind Mirror would have looked like
    if Leary had GPT-Image instead of Electronic Arts in 1985.

# MINING NOTES

mining_notes: |
  THE INTERPERSONAL CIRCUMPLEX WAS ALWAYS IN THE SKY.
  
  Timothy Leary discovered in statistics what the ancients encoded in geometry.
  
  Key Mind Mirror insights from this image:
  
  1. CIRCUMPLEX STRUCTURE — The wheel of personality is visible
  2. TWO AXES — Dominance (vertical) and Affiliation (horizontal)
  3. EIGHT OCTANTS — Each quadrant a personality style
  4. FOUR PLANES — Bio-energy, Emotional, Mental, Social
  5. NO TOXIC LEADERSHIP — Upper-left (dominant+hostile) is empty!
  6. CENTER IS SELF — The observer at the origin
  7. LINES ARE RELATIONSHIPS — Connect stars to predict dynamics
  8. NESTING IS DEPTH — Zoom in to find deeper truth
  
  Leary escaped prison by understanding his own test.
  We escape personality prisons by seeing the full constellation.
  
  "I am not just one star. I am the whole geometry."
