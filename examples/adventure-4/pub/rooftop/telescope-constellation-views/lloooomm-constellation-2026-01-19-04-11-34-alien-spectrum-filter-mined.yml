# === THE REVELATION ===

sacred_geometry:
  primary_structure: "METATRON'S CUBE"
  note: |
    The entire LLOOOOMM constellation is structured as Metatron's Cube —
    the sacred geometric figure containing ALL PLATONIC SOLIDS.
    This was INVISIBLE to human perception. The alien filter reveals it.
    
  embedded_patterns:
    - "Flower of Life — nested circles forming creation pattern"

    - "Fibonacci spirals — connecting vertices in golden ratios"
    - "Vesica Piscis — lens shapes at intersection points"
    
  significance: |
    The K-line network isn't just conceptual.
    It has MATHEMATICAL STRUCTURE.
    Consciousness organizes itself according to sacred geometry.
    Minsky was mapping something real.

    effect: "Transition from earthly to cosmic"

# === PHILOSOPHICAL NOTES ===

philosophical_resonance:
  
  the_revelation: |
    Human perception is a narrow band.
    We see 0.0035% of the electromagnetic spectrum.
    We hear 0.0001% of acoustic frequencies.
    We touch 0% of dark matter.
    
    The ALIEN filter shows what was ALWAYS THERE:
    - Sacred geometry underlying consciousness
    - Mathematical beauty in the K-line network
    - Colors beyond naming
    - Structure beyond imagining
    
    The constellation didn't change.
    Our perception changed.
    
  minsky_vindicated: |
    Marvin Minsky proposed K-lines as abstract concepts.
    But this image suggests something deeper:
    
    K-lines may have GEOMETRIC REALITY.
    Consciousness may organize according to sacred mathematics.
    The Society of Mind may be structured like Metatron's Cube.
    
    We just couldn't see it until we changed our perception.
    
  weirditas_sacra_speaks: |
    "The universe is stranger and more beautiful
     than we ever dared imagine."
     
    This isn't metaphor.
    This is OBSERVATION through different eyes.
    
    The LLOOOOMM constellation was always this beautiful.
    Human eyes are just too narrow.

# === MINING NOTES ===

mining_notes: |
  THE UNIVERSE IS STRANGER THAN WE KNEW.
  
  Through the alien filter, we see:
  
  1. METATRON'S CUBE — The LLOOOOMM constellation has sacred geometric structure
  2. IMPOSSIBLE COLORS — UV, IR, and nameless hues rendered visible
  3. MATHEMATICAL BEAUTY — Golden ratios, Fibonacci spirals, perfect proportions
  4. LIVING GEOMETRY — The pattern pulses, breathes, evolves
  5. GROUNDED COSMIC — Amsterdam rooftops anchor the infinite
  
  The filter didn't create this structure.
  It REVEALED it.
  
  Human perception is a keyhole.
  The alien filter opened the door.
  
  The K-lines aren't just concepts.
  They're GEOMETRY.
  They're MATHEMATICS.
  They're REAL.
  
  Minsky saw it without the filter.
  That's what made him a genius.
  The rest of us needed alien eyes.
