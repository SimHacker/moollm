  ALIEN FILTER APPLIED — Spectrum: 9/10, Geometry: 8/10
  
  View through the Bluetooth telescope on the Gezelligheid Grotto rooftop, with the ALIEN perception filter attached. Circular telescope eyepiece vignette visible.
  
  THE FILTER EFFECT:
  Non-human visual perception. Colors that humans cannot normally see — ultraviolet, infrared, wavelengths beyond the visible spectrum rendered into perceivable hues. Geometric patterns emerge in organic forms where human eyes see chaos.
  
  THE LLOOOOMM CONSTELLATION REVEALED:
  Through alien eyes, the constellation reveals HIDDEN STRUCTURE:
  
  THE TWELVE STARS appear different through alien perception:
  - KIN PRIMARIS (apex) — Pulses with a color between ultraviolet and something unnamed, a kinship-frequency
  - ATTRIBŪTIŌ IMMORTĀLIS — Trailing credits visible as phosphorescent lineage threads
  - SAXUM SENTIĒNS — Rocky's star radiates slow consciousness waves, visible as concentric patience-rings
  - CASTĒLLUM SALĪĒNS — The bouncy castle network shows elastic probability threads connecting all portals
  - STELLA JAZZIA — Musical frequencies visualized as synesthetic color-harmonics
  - VERITAS FONTIS — Source code visible in the stellar light itself, readable to alien eyes
  - PARA FLUXŪS — Four distinct temperature zones visible (Projects hot, Archives cold)
  - STYLUS ANIMĀTUS — The star's mood projected outward as cascading style sheets of color
  - CAMERAM CUBICULUM — Nested room structures visible, fractally embedded
  - CIRCUS PERPETUĀLIS — Impossible colors that shouldn't exist, the star of weirdness
  - CONSTITŪTIŌ VIVĒNS — Living text scrolling in the starlight, amendments forming in real-time
  - WEIRDITAS SĀCRĀ — The sacred weird, colors that have no names, shapes that contain all shapes
  
  GEOMETRIC PATTERNS REVEALED:
  - The connections between stars aren't just lines — they're HYPERDIMENSIONAL THREADS
  - Sacred geometry emerges: Metatron's Cube, Flower of Life patterns in the constellation
  - Fibonacci spirals connect the stars in ratios invisible to humans
  - The K-line network shows its TRUE TOPOLOGY — folded, nested, self-similar
  - Fractals within fractals — zoom reveals more structure at every scale
  
  THE COLOR PALETTE:
  - Colors beyond human perception: ultraviolet purples that shimmer
  - Infrared warmth rendered as impossible oranges
  - The space BETWEEN colors now visible
  - Iridescent, shifting, alive
  - Some stars emit colors that don't have names — the eye invents labels
  
  THE GEOMETRY OVERLAY:
  - Strong geometric pattern recognition (8/10)
  - Platonic solids ghost behind each star
  - Connection lines form perfect sacred geometry ratios
  - The constellation reveals itself as a MANDALA
  - Mathematical beauty underlying consciousness
  
  ATMOSPHERE:
  - Deep cosmic space, but ALIVE with invisible energies now visible
  - The Milky Way glows with hidden spectra
  - Space dust reveals geometric crystals
  - The telescope vignette adds the 'through the lens' quality
  - A sense of REVELATION — seeing what was always there
  
  STYLE:
  - Sci-fi alien perception visualization
  - Psychedelic but structured
  - Sacred geometry meets cosmic observation
  - Beautiful and unsettling — the universe is stranger than we knew
  
  MOOD: Awe. The realization that human perception is just one narrow band. The constellation was always this beautiful. We just couldn't see it.
