# 💕 VALENTINE FLUX — Romance & Rivalry Edition
#
# MOVED TO: skills/experiment/experiments/valentine-flux/
# This file remains as a reference for the pub's game collection.
# The full experiment (with runs, state, history) lives in the skill.
#
# Original design: A themed Fluxx deck for the Gezelligheid Grotto's Valentine's Day party.
# Romantic rules meet disruptive spice. Love is chaos. Chaos is love.
#
# DESIGN NOTE: This deck is a TRIBUTE to the Stanford Generative Agents paper,
# where Valentine's Day party emergence from a single seed demonstrated
# believable social simulation. We're running the same experiment but
# with MOOLLM characters and speed-of-light multi-agent simulation.

deck:
  name: Valentine Flux
  theme: "Romance, rivalry, and radical politics"
  tagline: "Love is in the air. So is chaos."
  
  creator_note: |
    Valentine Flux combines sweet romantic mechanics with disruptive 
    "hate cards" that represent the forces working against love.
    The tension between love and hate creates dramatic party dynamics.
    
    Goes "full Godwin" because some things are genuinely hateable,
    and the contrast makes the love cards more meaningful.

# BENCHMARK NOTES
# This deck is designed to support the Valentine's Day Party experiment

benchmark:
  purpose: |
    This Fluxx variant was created as part of the Valentine's Day 
    Party experiment in MOOLLM, directly inspired by the Stanford 
    Generative Agents paper (Park et al., 2023).
    
    In that paper, a single character's decision to throw a 
    Valentine's Day party cascaded through the social simulation
    as invitations spread, plans emerged, and characters arrived.
    
    We're recreating this emergence in MOOLLM with existing 
    characters, tracking:
    - How invitations spread through social networks
    - How romantic relationships affect party dynamics  
    - How the game (Valentine Flux) creates new interactions
    - Whether speed-of-light simulation preserves emergence
    
  metrics:
    - invitation_cascade: "How many turns until all characters know about party?"
    - rsvp_pattern: "Who accepts/declines based on relationships?"
    - valentine_writing: "Do characters write valentines to each other?"
    - party_dynamics: "What emergent behaviors appear at the party?"
    - game_outcomes: "How does Fluxx affect character relationships?"
    
  model_comparison: |
    Run with different models to compare:
    - Emergence quality (do social cascades feel natural?)
    - Relationship coherence (do characters act on their bonds?)
    - Dramatic tension (do conflicts emerge organically?)
    - Humor (is it fun?)
    
  rubric_score: |
    1 = Mechanical (no emergence, just following rules)
    2 = Functional (social cascade works, feels scripted)
    3 = Believable (characters have distinct reactions)
    4 = Emergent (unexpected but coherent behaviors)
    5 = Delightful (we want to save this transcript)
