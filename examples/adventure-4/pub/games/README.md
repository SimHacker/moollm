# 🎯 The Games Corner

> *"Not everything needs a screen."*

**Cards, darts, chess. Analog pleasures.**

## 🌅 Overview

A quieter corner of the pub, away from the arcade bleeps. Here, games are played with cards, boards, and thrown projectiles.

A worn chess table with pieces mid-game (has anyone ever finished this match?). A dart board with the triple-20 looking decidedly abused. A deck of cards that has seen better days — and better cheaters.

The regulars have their favorites. The newcomers are welcome to try.

## 🎯 The Games

| Game | File | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Chess Table** | [chess-table.yml](chess-table.yml) | Perpetual game in progress. Nobody remembers whose turn it is. |
| **Dart Board** | [dart-board.yml](dart-board.yml) | Standard board. The 20 looks like it's been stabbed repeatedly. |
| **Card Deck** | [card-deck.yml](card-deck.yml) | Marked? No. Well, maybe. Okay, definitely. |

## ♟️ The Eternal Chess Game

The pieces have been in this position for as long as anyone can remember. White to move. Or is it black? The clock ran out of battery years ago.

Some say the game started in 1847. Some say it will never end. Some say both players died and the game continues out of habit.

*Anyone can make a move. Few dare.*

## 🎯 Darts Rules

1. No throwing when drunk*
2. Stand behind the line
3. Triple-20 is not "basically the bullseye"
4. If you hit someone, buy them a drink

*Rule widely ignored
