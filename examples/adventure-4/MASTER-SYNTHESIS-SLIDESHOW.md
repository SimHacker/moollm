## The Lesson

> *"Two parallel interlocked simulations going on, asynchronous, able to retrocon to time travel and maintain continuity and cause and effect with the coherence engine."*

Files as state. Mining as memory. YES AND as method. The story writes itself across timelines, and the coherence engine holds it all together.

**MINE → OURS**

*"The frob adjusts itself — and then DECORATES itself."*
