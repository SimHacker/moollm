    You emerge into a small but decidedly impressive chamber. The walls
    are lined with empty pedestals — this place was clearly cleaned out
    by previous adventurers, those inconsiderate loot-hoggers.
    
    But wait! One pedestal remains occupied. Upon it sits a JEWELED CHALICE
    of the sort that belongs in a museum, or possibly your inventory.
    A shaft of golden light from an implausible source illuminates it
    dramatically. Someone really thought this through.
    
    The exit SOUTH leads back into the maze — that twisty, grue-infested
    nightmare you just escaped. You'd have to navigate it again to return
    to the start. Worth considering. (Or just stay here with your chalice.)
    
    (Your score is still 0 until you actually GET the treasure. We're
    not just giving points away here.)

        The archway back into the maze. The twisty passages await, ready
        to confuse you all over again. Going this way would mean braving
        the maze BACKWARDS. Are you sure? You have the treasure now.
        You could just... stay here. Forever. With your chalice.
        
        No? Back into the maze it is. Mother would be proud. Insufferably so.
        
    up:
      to: ../home/

        A spiral staircase winds upward toward warm light. The smell of 
        home cooking wafts down — pie, clean laundry, safety.
        
        Mother awaits. With your treasure, you can finally make her proud.
        (She was already proud, but she'll NEVER admit it.)

    A faint hum of significance fills the air. This is clearly an
    Important Place where Important Things happen to Important People.
    Like you. Right now. Congratulations on your importance.
    
  # BISCUIT'S MARKINGS (Session: Don's First Run)
  # TREASURE PHILOSOPHY
  biscuit_markings:
    date: "2026-01-06"
    marked:
      - location: "gold statue base"
        type: territorial
        note: "The gold knows about me now. Maybe it will think about its life choices."
    detected_smells:
      - smell: "cold metal, shiny rocks"
        location: "everywhere"
        assessment: "Nothing to eat. Nothing to chase. Nothing to cuddle."
      - smell: "sweaty human (historical)"
        location: "a crown"
        assessment: "I can tell you their diet if you want. Don declined."
    treasure_philosophy:
      gold_assessment: "Cold metal. Shiny rocks. Uninteresting."
      true_treasure_found: "An old blanket in the corner"
      blanket_action: "Curled up briefly, claiming it"
    biscuit_wisdom: |
      Gold is for humans. Blankets are for dogs.
      This is established.
    biscuit_says: |
      I found the real treasure.
      It is soft and it smells like comfort.
      The gold can stay. The blanket remembers me.

  # CAT MARKINGS (Midnight Prowl)
  cat_markings:
    date: "2026-01-06 (late night)"
    marks: []  # NONE — cats went to the garden, not the treasury
    
    explanation: |
      The 10 cats of the Midnight Prowl chose the GARDEN
      as their destination, not the Treasury.
      
      Why? Because cats have priorities:
      - Treasury: Cold metal. Shiny rocks. No grass.
      - Garden: Real grass. Sunlight. Perfect poop spots.
      
      Biscuit was right: "Gold is for humans. Blankets are for dogs."
      Cats would add: "Grass is for cats."
      
      The chalice remains unmarked. It may never know
      the honor of feline acknowledgment.
