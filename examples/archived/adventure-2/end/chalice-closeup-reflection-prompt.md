## Prompt

Close-up of a polished golden chalice's curved surface, acting as a convex mirror. In the distorted reflection: empty stone pedestals, a shaft of magical light from above, and hints of ancient treasury walls. The reflection tells the story — this is the LAST treasure, the one that remained. The gold surface is imperfect enough to be real, polished enough to reflect. A world of loss and triumph captured in curved metal.

**Style:** Artistic still life with narrative depth. Think Dutch Golden Age painting meets fantasy photography.

**Mood:** "Everyone else took what they could. I waited for YOU."
