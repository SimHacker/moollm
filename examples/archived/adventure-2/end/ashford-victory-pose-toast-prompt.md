## Prompt

Three-quarter shot of Captain Ashford in classic Belter toast pose. In one hand, raised high, the Jeweled Chalice — the treasure he won. In the other, his dented silver flask — the companion that's been with him through the dark. He's toasting the empty treasury, toasting the absent Mother, toasting the grues he didn't feed, toasting the egg that became a beacon.

His stance is pure Belter swagger — weight on back foot, hips cocked, head tilted with that knowing grin. The Nomi cape drapes over one shoulder. This is a man celebrating not just treasure, but SURVIVAL.

**Style:** Character action shot with narrative weight. Like a movie still from the "hero drinks to victory" scene.

**Mood:** "To everyone who said I couldn't. To Mother, who knew I would. To the BEACON."
