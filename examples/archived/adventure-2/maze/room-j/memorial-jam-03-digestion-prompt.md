## Prompt

Captain Ashford clutches his stomach dramatically, doubled over in the throes of digestive TRANSFORMATION. His face shows transcendent agony — that exquisite moment between consumption and creation.

One hand on his belly (which seems to glow faintly pink from within). The other hand braced against the vending machine for support. His cape pools dramatically on the floor.

His expression walks the line between intense discomfort and spiritual ecstasy. Something IMPORTANT is happening inside him.

The blue lamp flickers sympathetically. The empty jam jar lies discarded nearby.

**Style:** Baroque religious ecstasy meets food transformation body horror (but tasteful). Think Caravaggio painting a stomachache.

**Mood:** "This is not suffering. This is METAMORPHOSIS. The jam is becoming something greater."
