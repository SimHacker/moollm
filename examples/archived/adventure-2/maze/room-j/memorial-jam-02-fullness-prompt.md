## Prompt

Captain Ashford in the midst of enthusiastic jam consumption. His face is gloriously smeared with strawberry jam — on his cheeks, his chin, possibly his nose. He doesn't care. This is MEMORIAL EATING.

His left hand holds the nearly-empty jar. His right hand is open, palm up, displaying the Skeleton Memorial Coin. The coin's inscription "ONE ROOM AWAY" is visible — this is WHY he's doing this.

His expression is pure, uncomplicated bliss. Eyes half-lidded with pleasure. A smile despite the mouthful.

The vending machine watches. Its display shows a pleased emoji.

**Style:** Messy food photography meets emotional documentary. Authentic, joyful, unashamed.

**Mood:** "I am FULL of grandmother's love and I am doing this for someone who couldn't."
