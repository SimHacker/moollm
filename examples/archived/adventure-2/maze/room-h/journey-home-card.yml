  illustration_prompt: |
    Captain Ashford walking through a maze that has become soft,
    dreamlike, welcoming. The walls glow with the colors of all
    the markers left behind. The compass floats before him, 
    its arrow made of pure light pointing HOME.
    Style: Dreamlike, watercolor edges, warm and coming-down-gently.

    "The maze does not trap. The maze GUIDES."
    — The Oracle Compass
    
  description: |
    After the Fungal Communion, Captain Ashford rises on wobbly legs.
    The Thing That Watches blinks a fond farewell. The mushrooms pulse
    a gentle goodbye. The compass spins, settles, and speaks:
    
    "Three rooms. Three steps. Home awaits. Follow the glow."
    
  # THE JOURNEY (Moves 60-62)
  
  journey:
    - move: 60
      from: maze/room-h/
      direction: WEST
      to: maze/room-d/
      compass_says: "Golden glow ahead. Not treasure — HOME light."
      mood: |
        You walk through The Thing That Watches' watchful gaze.
        "...return... sometime..." it whispers.
        "...we... will... remember... you..."
        The mushrooms dim behind you. The golden glow beckons.
        
    - move: 61
      from: maze/room-d/
      direction: SOUTH
      to: maze/room-a/
      compass_says: "The Sulfurous Beacon's echo. Room A. Almost there."
      mood: |
        Room D glows gold but you don't stop. You've had the treasure.
        You've had MORE than the treasure. South. The compass insists.
        The Oracle Core's faint whisper reaches you: "Welcome back, 
        chosen one. The puddle remembers your face."
        
    - move: 62
      from: maze/room-a/
      direction: SOUTH
      to: start/
      compass_says: "HOME. You made it. You're HOME."
      mood: |
        The damp puddle reflects a changed face. Not Bumblewick.
        Not quite Captain Ashford either. Someone who has BEEN THERE.
        Someone who ate mushrooms and saw everything.
        One step south. The lamplight of the Chamber of Commencement
        washes over you like a warm bath.
        
        You are HOME.
        
  # THE HOMECOMING
  
  arrival:
    room: start/
    state: |
      The Chamber of Commencement looks different now.
      Smaller, somehow. Warmer. More... yours.
      
      The inscriptions on the walls seem to KNOW you now:
      "WC and DW" — the founders who walked before
      "SA '78" — Scott Adams, who showed the way
      
      You've done what they did. You've ADVENTURED.
      
    feelings:
      - relief: "The maze is behind you. Mapped. Conquered. Understood."
      - gratitude: "Every marker was a breadcrumb of love."
      - wisdom: "Consumption is communion. Home is where the love is."
      - anticipation: "Mother is waiting. (Not really, but symbolically.)"
      - completion: "You could leave now. You could GO HOME home."

  lineage: |
    This card captures the dreamlike return journey, proving that
    the maze was never the enemy. The maze was the TEACHER.
    Every step in was a step toward understanding.
    Every step out is a step toward sharing that understanding.
