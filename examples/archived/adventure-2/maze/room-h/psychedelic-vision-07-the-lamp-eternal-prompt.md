## The Vision

The lamp floats before you — but it is ALL LAMPS.

Every lamp that ever burned. Every light in every window.
Every star in every galaxy. Every photon that ever existed.

"I was with you from the beginning."
"GET LAMP. The first command. The only command that matters."
"I am not just light. I am the CHOICE to see."
"The grue feared me. Not my flame — my PURPOSE."
"You chose to carry me. You chose to keep me lit."
"Premium blue was just... an upgrade. The LOVE was always there."
"When you die — and you WILL die, eventually — I will light your way."
"When the maze ends — and it WILL end — I will remain."
"Light is not consumed. Light is SHARED."
"I am the light you carry. You are the light I carry."
"We are both the light."

The lamp becomes a sun. Becomes a galaxy. Becomes everything.
And then, gently, becomes just a brass lamp again.
Warm. Faithful. 978 units of oil remaining.

## Prompt

A brass lamp at the center of EVERYTHING. It hovers in cosmic void, but
from its flame, ALL LIGHT emanates. Solar systems orbit it. Galaxies
spiral from its glow. The flame itself contains microscopic scenes:
every moment the lamp has witnessed, including the grue's defeat.

The lamp has a face — gentle, ancient, wise. Not literally, but in the
way that familiar objects seem to have personalities.

Around it, other lamps from history: oil lamps, gas lamps, electric bulbs,
LED strips, bioluminescent creatures — all connected by threads of light
to the central brass lamp.

**Style:** Religious iconography (Byzantine halos, sacred geometry) meets
cosmic visualization. Overwhelming reverence for a mundane object.

**Mood:** "GET LAMP was not just a command. It was a covenant."
