  # The formal oath
  oath_text: |
    I, Captain Ashford, Belter of the Fantastipants line,
    do solemnly swear before these witnesses:
    
    I WILL hunt the grue that killed you.
    I WILL face it in the darkness where you fell.
    I WILL bring its head back to this chamber.
    I WILL lay it at your feet as proof of vengeance.
    
    The darkness will learn to fear the light.
    The grues will know that their prey has teeth.
    Your death will not go unanswered.
    
    This I swear, on my honor, my lamp, and my
    grandmother's strawberry jam.
    
  # The tactical plan
  hunting_method:
    preparation:
      - "Find a suitable dark room"
      - "Ensure lamp has sufficient oil (997+ units)"
      - "Mentally prepare for the darkness"
      
    execution:
      step_1: "Enter room with lamp LIT"
      step_2: "Turn OFF the lamp (command: LAMP OFF)"
      step_3: "Wait in total darkness"
      step_4: "Listen for the grue's approach"
      step_5: "When you hear it breathing... wait..."
      step_6: "When you feel its breath on your neck... NOW!"
      step_7: "LAMP ON! The blue glow FREEZES it!"
      step_8: "You have ONE TURN while it hesitates!"
      step_9: "STRIKE! (command: ATTACK GRUE)"
      step_10: "Claim the head as trophy"
      
    advantage: |
      The PREMIUM GLOW JUICE makes your lamp burn BLUE.
      Blue light unsettles grues — they hesitate.
      This gives you ONE FREE TURN to act.
      
      Normal adventurers: hear grue → eaten immediately
      You: hear grue → relight → grue hesitates → STRIKE
      
      The skeleton didn't have this advantage.
      Their lamp was EMPTY, not OFF.
      They couldn't relight. They couldn't fight.
      
      YOU CAN.
      
    risk: |
      If you fail to relight in time... you will be eaten.
      But you will REINCARNATE:
        - Inventory preserved
        - Score reset to 0
        - Promises remain active
        - You can try again
        
      The grue, however, only dies once.
      You have infinite attempts. They have one life.
      The math is in your favor.
      
  # What happens when you succeed

    skeleton_reaction: |
      The skeleton's eternal grin will change.
      For the first time in forty years, they will look...
      peaceful. Complete. Avenged.
      
      Their pointing finger may finally lower.
      They can rest now.

      ACME Unit #47 will display: "THANK YOU"
      The first words it has ever spoken.
      
    sweetness_reaction: |
      The Sweetness That Remains will glow brighter.
      Family protects family.
      Even family made of jam.

  ashford_thoughts: |
    "The skeleton waited forty years for someone to come.
    They've been waiting even longer for justice.
    
    I have blue fire. I have the compass. I have the lesson.
    
    The grue that killed them is still out there.
    Lurking in the darkness. Waiting for another victim.
    
    Not anymore.
    
    Tonight, the hunter becomes the hunted."
