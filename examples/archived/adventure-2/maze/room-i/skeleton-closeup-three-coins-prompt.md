### The Story
These three coins are all that remain of a fortune. The skeleton had over 100 gold — but used coins to mark the maze. Fatal mistake: gold all looks the same. They couldn't tell which room was which. In panic, they dropped the rest in Room F and ran blindly. Almost made it. Almost.

## Prompt

Close-up of three gold coins lying in a skeletal palm. The coins are worn from handling — this adventurer checked their gold often. Each coin bears the same face, the same design. IDENTICAL.

That's the point. That's the tragedy. Gold can't guide you.

The bones of the hand are slightly curled, as if in the final moments they clutched these last coins — their ONLY remaining wealth — knowing it couldn't save them.

One coin has blood staining the edge (from the grue attack, dried to rust). One has a bite mark (grue teeth). The third is pristine, as if mocking the chaos around it.

In the shadows beyond, barely visible, the Memorial Pie weeps gravy.

**Style:** Dutch Golden Age still life meets adventure game inventory screen.

**Mood:** "Gold buys oil. Gold buys food. Gold CANNOT buy direction. Lesson learned."

## Technical Notes

- Aspect ratio: 1:1 (square)
- Focus: Sharp on coins, skeletal hand slightly soft
- Lighting: Warm lamplight making gold gleam ironically
- Color palette: Bright gold, pale bone, deep shadows, hint of rust-red
- Detail: Coins must look IDENTICAL — that's the lesson
