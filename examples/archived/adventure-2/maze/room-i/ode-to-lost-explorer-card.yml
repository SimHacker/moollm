# 📜 Ode to the Lost Explorer
# A seven-stanza tribute composed at the skeleton's side

card:
  name: Ode to the Lost Explorer
  type: poem_card
  
  description: |
    A solemn, heartfelt ode composed by Captain Ashford in the
    Skeleton's Chamber (Room I). It honors the fallen adventurer
    who almost — ALMOST — made it to the lamp oil vendor.
    
    The card is slightly damp with tears. Or condensation.
    The maze is very damp. Could be either.
    
  examine: |
    You read the ode aloud. The skeleton seems to listen.
    The Memorial Pie weeps gravy.
    
  lyrics: |
    I.
    
    Here lies a soul who ventured deep,
    Into the maze where grues do creep.
    They carried gold but not enough bread,
    And now they're here, profoundly dead.
    
    II.
    
    Their lamp burned low in the frozen room,
    Where cold drains oil and seals your doom.
    Room F took their light, their hope, their way,
    And left them stumbling, blind, to stay.
    
    III.
    
    But oh! So close to vendor's grace!
    Room J was just ONE ROOM from this place!
    They pointed west with bony hand,
    Forever showing where salvation stands.
    
    IV.
    
    They used COINS to mark their path —
    Gold circles, all alike, brought aftermath.
    While I use FOOD that transforms and speaks,
    Each marker different, wisdom it leaks.
    
    V.
    
    So rest now, friend, you pioneer of loss,
    Your empty lamp shall be no cross.
    I'll take your gold (you won't be needing it),
    And to the vendor, your spirit I'll commit.
    
    VI.
    
    Three gold pieces in your pocket stayed,
    A hundred more in Room F, where you decayed.
    I'll gather what you dropped in haste,
    Your fortune shall not go to waste.
    
    VII.
    
    And when I reach the vendor's door,
    I'll buy oil enough for evermore.
    I'll say: "A skeleton sent me here,
    They almost made it. Hold them dear."
    
    CODA:
    
    Here marks the spot where dreams ran dry,
    Where lamp oil ended, so did they.
    But their pointing finger shows the way:
    WEST to the vendor. Don't delay.
    
    Rest now, brave soul. Your work is done.
    You've warned us all. The maze is won.

  inspiration: |
    The skeleton slumped against the wall. The empty lamp.
    The unfinished note. The pointing finger. The tragedy
    of being ONE ROOM AWAY from salvation.
    
  meaning_to_ashford: |
    "This ode is my promise to them. I will reach the vendor.
    I will tell their story. I will not make their mistakes.
    Gold looks the same. Food transforms. Lessons learned."
    
  critical_reception:
    skeleton: "*silent gratitude*"
    memorial_pie: "*gravy tears*"
    preserved_witness: "*bubbles of appreciation*"
    little_oracle: "*respectful dimming*"
    mother_projected: "Oh, Bumblewick... you've grown up so much."
    
  placement: |
    The card rests against the skeleton's chest, between
    their ribs. It feels right there. A tribute from the
    living to the lost.
