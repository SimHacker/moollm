  description: |
    The grapes have transformed into a small, ornate crown of
    crystallized grape essence — purple, regal, and slightly fizzy.
    It sits atop a cobweb throne like it was always meant to be there.
    
    Mother's favorite fruit has become Mother's favorite headwear
    (if Mother wore crowns made of fermented fruit, which she might,
    you don't actually know all her hobbies).
    
  examine: |
    The crown sparkles with fermented wisdom:
    
    "...royalty is earned, not given..."
    "...even seedless, we bear fruit..."
    "...Mother would understand... eventually..."
    "...purple is the color of transformed ambition..."
    
    A tiny bubble rises from one of the crystallized grapes and
    pops with a sound like a tiny royal proclamation.

  opinions:
    of_player: |
      "You ate us. We thank you. Through consumption, we achieved
      MONARCHY. Not many bunches of grapes can say that."
    of_mother: |
      "She loved us seedless and fresh. But would she not love us
      more as a CROWN? We have improved. We have ASCENDED."
    of_room: |
      "The cobwebs make excellent drapery. The spiders are gone
      but their work remains. We appreciate good craftsmanship."
    of_sulfurous_beacon: |
      "Far away. Good. Royalty does not associate with such
      COMMON smells. We are REFINED fermentation. That egg is
      just... loud."
      
  mothers_reaction_predicted: |
    "Bumblewick! Those were my favorite grapes!"
    "...actually, that crown is quite fetching."
    "I suppose I can't be TOO angry."
    "...can I wear it?"
    
  lineage: |
    From Mother's favorite fruit, through the Fantastipants Express,
    to the first monarch of the deep maze.
    
    "From vine to crown. From consumption to coronation."
    
    The Crown of Fermentation marks the entrance to unexplored
    territory — rooms E, F, G, H, I, J await beyond.
