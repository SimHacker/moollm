    - id: 3
      promise: "Not waste the food"
      status: "⚖️ TECHNICALLY COMPLIANT"
      interpretation: |
        Mother said: "Food is for DROPPING IN THE MAZE to mark your path"
        We interpreted this... CREATIVELY.

      defense: |
        "Mother, I didn't WASTE the food. I TRANSFORMED it.
        Each item became a MARKER — just not dropped, EXCRETED.
        And the cheese became a WEAPON that SLAYED A GRUE.
        And the mushrooms showed me the nature of existence.
        
        Is that... waste? Or is that PEAK EFFICIENCY?"
        
      mother_approval: "PENDING REVIEW (she'll probably sigh and accept it)"
      notes: "The food chain spiral vision confirms: consumption IS communion."

        The promise was "not be eaten by a grue."
        We didn't just avoid being eaten.

        The lamp is not just maintained. It is EXALTED.
        It burns electric blue. It hesitates grues.
        It is the physical manifestation of "I am prepared."

      You did it. You ACTUALLY did it.
      
      The treasure. The gold. The clothing. The lamp.
      You even... ate the thing that eats adventurers?
      
      I'm not sure whether to be proud or concerned.
      I'm choosing PROUD.
      
      Now please come home. And do those dishes."
