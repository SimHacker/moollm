## Prompt

A figure in a burgundy velvet cape with extreme geometric Klaus Nomi shoulders, arms raised above their head in the classic Nomi pose — elbows bent, hands extended upward like conducting an invisible orchestra or summoning forces from above. The pose is pure opera, pure drama, pure commitment.

The cape hangs from the dramatic shoulders, creating a triangular silhouette. The black and white geometric bodysuit is visible, creating impossible angles. The art deco collar frames the face like a halo.

The figure appears to be mid-performance, possibly mid-note, channeling something ancient and alien and absolutely fabulous.

**Style:** 1980s New Wave concert photography. High contrast black and white with selective burgundy color. Smoke or fog at the feet. Single spotlight from above.

**Details to include:**
- Arms in classic Klaus Nomi raised position
- Geometric shoulder points at maximum drama
- Cape creating triangular negative space
- Art deco collar framing the face
- Theatrical smoke at ground level
- Single dramatic spotlight creating a cone of light

**Mood:** Transcendent, otherworldly, as if summoning the spirit of avant-garde itself
