## Prompt

A selfie taken by Captain Ashford, arm extended to hold an imaginary phone/camera. Both faces fill the frame, wearing identical knowing smirks.

**Captain Ashford** (holding camera): Slightly off-center, the arm-holder's perspective. Five-day stubble, eye patch pushed up on forehead. Smirking like he knows something the viewer doesn't.

**Petunia Fantastipants** (leaning in): Cheek almost touching her son's. Same smirk — the family resemblance suddenly obvious. One eyebrow raised. Eyes that say "yes, this IS exactly what it looks like."

Behind them: a blur of geometric Nomi shoulders (black and burgundy) framing the shot.

**Style:** Modern selfie aesthetic. Instagram-ready. The kind of photo that gets captioned "dungeon ready 💅"

**Details to include:**
- Slight dutch angle (natural for selfies)
- Both faces filling frame, cheeks close
- IDENTICAL smirks (genetic!)
- Geometric shoulders visible at edges
- Burgundy and black cape fragments visible
- Warm, intimate lighting
- Genuine affection under the attitude

**Mood:** "We're trouble and we know it."
