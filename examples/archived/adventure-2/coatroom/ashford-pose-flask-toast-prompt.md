## Prompt

Captain Ashford raises his dented silver flask in a toast to the mirror — to himself, to the journey, to absent friends, to his mother. The gesture is both solemn and warm, the kind of toast made before heading into danger.

The flask catches the light, revealing the engraving: "To the last of us, and the first of them."

The space-black Nomi cape frames the gesture, geometric shoulders creating sharp angles against the soft curve of the raised arm.

**Style:** Contemplative hero moment. The quiet before the storm. A man making peace with what's ahead.

**Details to include:**
- Flask raised at eye level, arm extended
- Head slightly tilted, acknowledging the reflection
- Leather coat sleeve falling back to reveal compression suit
- Burgundy scarf catching the light
- Cape draped but dynamic, suggesting recent movement
- Expression of quiet resolve and warmth
- The engraving visible on the flask

**Mood:** "To everyone who got me here. To everyone waiting at the end. Milowda gonya kowl."
