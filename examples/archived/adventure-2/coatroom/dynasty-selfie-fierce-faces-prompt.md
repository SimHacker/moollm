## Prompt

A selfie where both subjects are making their most intimidating faces directly at camera. The kind of photo you'd send to grues as a warning.

**Captain Ashford**: Eye patch pulled DOWN over one eye (battle mode). Jaw set. One-eyed glare that's seen pirate wars. Nostril flare.

**Petunia Fantastipants**: Expression of pure maternal fury — the face that made young Bumblewick do his homework. Eyes narrowed. Lips pressed thin. The "don't even THINK about it" look.

The combined effect is TERRIFYING. This is the face of a dynasty that has survived caves, vacuums, and family dinners.

**Style:** Dramatic selfie. Intimidation photography. The "squad goals for scaring enemies" aesthetic.

**Details to include:**
- Both faces in intimidation mode
- His eye patch DOWN (serious business)
- Her expression: maternal rage distilled
- Geometric shoulders creating aggressive silhouette
- Black and burgundy framing like war colors
- Intensity cranked to maximum
- But still... a hint of fun underneath

**Mood:** "Grues. We're coming. And we're ANGRY."
