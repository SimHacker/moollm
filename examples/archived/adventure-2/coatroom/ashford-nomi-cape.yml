item:
  name: "The Belter Captain's Cape: Nomi Edition"
  type: costume_accessory
  created_by: Maurice the Magnificent
  for: Bumblewick Fantastipants (as Captain Ashford)
  pairs_with: "The Adventurer Emerita: Nomi Edition (Mother's cape)"
  
  concept: |
    When Mother wears her burgundy Adventurer Emerita cape with Klaus Nomi
    shoulders, and you wear this — the two capes RHYME. They're clearly
    a matched set, clearly family, clearly ready to conquer dungeons TOGETHER.
    
    Hers says: "I conquered caves before you were born."
    Yours says: "I learned from the best, and I went to SPACE."
  
  description: |
    A dramatic cape in deep SPACE BLACK velvet — the black of the void
    between stars. But the Klaus Nomi geometric shoulder points are lined
    with the same BURGUNDY as Mother's cape, creating visual harmony when
    standing side by side.
    
    The lining is silver lamé (matching Mother's), but instead of cave maps,
    it displays STAR CHARTS — the Belt, the stations, the routes a pirate
    captain would know by heart. Tycho Station is marked in gold thread.
    
    The clasp: a miniature spinning asteroid that plays a few notes of
    a Belter work song when opened — harmonizing with Mother's operatic note.

    the_effect_together: |
      When Petunia in burgundy and Bumblewick-as-Ashford in black stand
      together, the matching shoulder geometry creates a visual echo.
      The silver linings flash as they move. The musical clasps can
      harmonize if opened together.
      
      They look like: a dynasty. A legend. A family that conquers things.
      
      Other dungeon-goers will KNOW: these two are together. These two
      have STORIES. These two should not be trifled with.
  
  # How it integrates with the Ashford costume
  integration:
    with_ashford_costume: |
      The cape goes OVER the leather coat, adding a layer of Klaus Nomi
      drama to the practical Belter aesthetic. The burgundy shoulder
      lining peeks out, coordinating with the burgundy silk scarf.
      
      The effect: Space pirate captain who also attends avant-garde operas.
      Functional AND fashionable. Ashford would approve.
      
    without_ashford_costume: |
      Can also be worn over the waistcoat for a "Bumblewick but make it
      Nomi" look. The cape transforms any outfit into an EVENT.

  lineage: |
    Maurice created both capes as a matched set the moment they understood
    the assignment. The Fantastipants family would not merely attend
    dungeon openings — they would ARRIVE.
    
    The design philosophy: different enough to honor individual identities,
    similar enough to proclaim "we are TOGETHER."
