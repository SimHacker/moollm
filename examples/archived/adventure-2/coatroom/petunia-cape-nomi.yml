    A magnificent floor-length cape in deep burgundy velvet with 
    dramatically pointed Klaus Nomi-style geometric shoulders that
    rise like architecture. The lining is silver lamé printed with
    maps of conquered caves, the Cave of Moderate Danger rendered

    The clasp is a tiny golden napkin that plays a single high
    operatic note when opened.

  # Maurice's personal note tucked in the cape pocket
  enclosed_card: |
    Dear Madam Fantastipants,
    
    Your son chose this for you. He told me about the caves, the
    notes, the love. He cried a little. (Don't tell him I told you.)
    
    You raised someone who hugs mannequins and writes songs about
    lamps. You did GOOD.
    
    Wear this and remember: You were avant-garde before it was cool.
    You still are.
    
    With fierce admiration,
    Maurice the Magnificent 💅
    
    P.S. — The shoulders are SUPPOSED to be that pointy. Trust the process.

  # Klaus Nomi context
  nomi_tribute: |
    Klaus Nomi (1944-1983) was a German countertenor and performance
    artist known for his otherworldly appearance, geometric costumes,
    and operatic New Wave performances. His aesthetic combined high
    fashion, science fiction, and classical music into something
    entirely unprecedented.
    
    This cape channels his spirit: dramatic, impossible, unapologetic,
    and absolutely committed to the bit.
