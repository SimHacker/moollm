## The Moment

The first embrace. Mother crossing the kitchen in three steps. 
Arms wrapping around the hero she sent into the maze.
Two Nomi capes — purple lightning and space-black stars — 
billowing together like they were always meant to meet.

Tears on both faces. Pride. Relief. Love.

## Prompt

Two figures embracing in a warm, golden-lit kitchen. 

**Mother (Petunia Fantastipants):** Older woman with kind eyes, wearing a magnificent 
deep purple cape with silver lightning bolt trim. Tears streaming down her face, 
but smiling. The Adventurer Emerita.

**Captain Ashford (Bumblewick):** Adventurer in a space-black cape with cosmic patterns,
face weathered by adventure, eyes bright with homecoming. The Grue Slayer returned.

Their capes billow together, purple and black intertwining. Behind them, a pie cools 
on a windowsill. A brass lamp glows blue on the counter. Gold coins glitter on the table.

**Style:** Warm, emotional, domestic yet epic. Norman Rockwell's sentimentality meets 
Studio Ghibli's wonder. Golden hour kitchen light.

**Mood:** "You came home. You actually came home."
