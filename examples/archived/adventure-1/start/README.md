| Object | File | Purpose |

| Property | Value |

## Exits

| Direction | Destination | What Awaits |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **North** | [maze/room-a/](../maze/room-a/) | ⚠️ DARK! Grues! GET LAMP FIRST! |
| **West** | [kitchen/](../kitchen/) | Food for maze mapping |
| **East** | [coatroom/](../coatroom/) | Costume transformations |

## The Lamp

**GET LAMP before going north.** This is not a suggestion.

The [Brass Lamp](./lamp.yml) has:
- **400 oil** — enough for ~400 moves
- **Floating-point consumption** — different actions cost different amounts
- **Environmental modifiers** — cold room-f drains oil 2× faster!

## Scratched Initials

The walls bear the marks of adventurers past:
- **WC+DW '76** — Will Crowther & Don Woods (Colossal Cave)
- **SA '78** — Scott Adams (the other adventure pioneer)
- **XYZZY WAS HERE** — The classic magic word
