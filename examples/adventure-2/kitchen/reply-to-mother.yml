    Dear Mother,
    
    I love you. I don't say it enough — I know I don't — but 
    sitting here in this impossible replica of our kitchen, 
    reading your note, knowing you KNEW this would happen and
    prepared for me anyway... Mother, I love you more than
    all my decorative spoons combined. And you know how I feel
    about those spoons.
    
    Thank you. For the food. For the lamp advice. For stocking
    this kitchen. But most of all, thank you for what you said
    about the coat room. For giving me permission to be whoever
    I need to be. You magnificent, terrifying woman.
    
    PROMISES:
    
    I promise to find you a treasure.
    I promise to bring you gold pieces.
    I promise not to waste the food.
    I promise not to be eaten by a grue.
    I promise to create something fabulous and mail it to you.
    I promise to take care of the lamp.
    I promise to return home safely.
    I promise to do those dishes when I get back.
    
    P.S. — If I die, tell my spoons I loved them.
    
    P.P.S. — I'm enclosing my first composition: The Fantastipants
    Victory Ballad. I wrote it the moment I picked up the lamp.
    
    [SONG ENCLOSED]
    
    This song means: I am choosing to keep going. I am choosing
    to find light in dark places. I am choosing to be ridiculous
    and alive rather than sensible and defeated.
    
    You taught me that. This song is what you made me.
    
    With all my love and all my lamp oil,
    Your Bumblewick
