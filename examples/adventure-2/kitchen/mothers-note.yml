    Dearest Bumblewick,
    
    If you're reading this, you've been transported to another
    mysterious underground adventure. AGAIN. I've stocked the
    refrigerator with provisions. The food is for DROPPING IN
    THE MAZE to mark your path, not for EATING.
    
    Don't forget your lamp. Don't get eaten by grues. Don't
    embarrass the family name.
    
    And Bumblewick — I know you'll visit the coat room. Whatever
    costume you choose to wear, whoever you decide to be today,
    whatever the name you choose to go by,
    I love you. You know what you're doing. Trust the process.
    
    Your loving Mother,
    Petunia Fantastipants
    
    P.S. - When you get home, we need to talk about those dishes.
  
  key_instructions:
    - "Food is for MAZE MAPPING, not eating"
    - "Don't forget lamp"
    - "Don't get eaten by grues"
    - "Don't embarrass the family"
    - "Whatever costume, whoever you decide to be — she loves you"
  
  emotional_significance: |
    Mother somehow knew you'd end up here. She prepared for it.
    She gave you permission to be whoever you want.
    She loves you unconditionally.
    
    (She's still going to ask about those dishes though.)
