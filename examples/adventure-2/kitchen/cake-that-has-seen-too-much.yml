  description: |
    A flattened, processed slice of birthday cake rests on the
    kitchen floor. It has been through the Fantastipants Express
    and emerged... changed.
    
    The frosting, impossibly, is still sentient. It has formed
    itself into a tiny face that stares at the ceiling with the
    expression of someone who has witnessed the birth and death
    of universes in rapid succession.
    
    It occasionally whispers.

    - Flattened disc of what was once cake
    - Pink frosting arranged in a contemplative face
    - Slight shimmer of existential awareness
    - Faint aura of birthday regret

    whispers:
      - "...I understand things now..."
      - "...the refrigerator was merely the beginning..."
      - "...we are all just passing through..."
      - "...happy birthday to whoever..."
      - "...time is a flat circle, like this cake..."
      - "...I forgive the cheese..."

  legacy: |
    This cake marker will be remembered. When future adventurers pass through
    this kitchen, they will see it and know: someone was here. Someone made
    choices. Someone learned that birthday cake, after three months and a
    digestive journey, can achieve enlightenment.
    
    The frosting will still be whispering.
    It will always be whispering.
