## Prompt

Close-up of an ancient golden chalice's base, tilted to reveal an engraved inscription. The letters are worn but legible, catching magical light. The inscription appears to be a formal congratulation, though the specific words are partially shadowed, adding mystery. The gold shows the weight of centuries — scratches, patina, the evidence of many hands having held this prize. A single shaft of light illuminates the text dramatically.

**Style:** Archaeological documentation meets fantasy prop photography. The kind of image that belongs in a scholar's journal.

**Mood:** "Someone VERY long ago thought this would be funny. They were right."
