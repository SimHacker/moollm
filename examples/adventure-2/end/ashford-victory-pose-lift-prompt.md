## Prompt

Full-body shot of Captain Ashford (Bumblewick Fantastipants) in the Treasury of Modest Proportions. He stands in the dramatic shaft of magical light, arms raised triumphantly, holding the Jeweled Chalice aloft. His space-black Nomi cape billows behind him despite the absence of wind — this is a MOMENT. His Belter captain's coat is open, revealing the burgundy scarf. His expression: pure, unfiltered joy. The joy of a reluctant hero who just became LEGEND.

Behind him, empty pedestals. Above him, impossible light. In his hands, TREASURE.

**Style:** Fantasy hero portrait meets space opera character poster. The moment you'd put on a movie poster.

**Mood:** "MOTHER, LOOK WHAT I DID!"
