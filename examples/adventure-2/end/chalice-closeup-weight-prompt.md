## Prompt

Low-angle view of a golden chalice, shot from below looking up. The solid gold base dominates the frame — thick, substantial, HEAVY. Light catches the underside, revealing the density of the metal. This is not gold-plated, not gold-tone, not gilded. This is REAL. The gems on the rim sparkle distantly above, but the focus is on that base — the weight of centuries, the weight of value, the weight of VICTORY.

**Style:** Dramatic low-angle product photography. The kind of shot that makes you FEEL the heft.

**Mood:** "This will make your arms tired. This is WORTH making your arms tired."
