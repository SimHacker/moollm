    Dearest Mother,
    
    I DID IT.
    
    I'm writing this from the Treasury of Modest Proportions, surrounded
    by empty pedestals and the lingering scent of magical light. In my
    hands — well, technically tucked under my arm as I write this — is
    the JEWELED CHALICE. Real gold. Rubies. Emeralds. The inscription
    says it's worth 10 points. I think it's worth more than that.
    
    It's worth your pride.
    
    ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                           THE PROMISES
    ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    
    You made me promise eight things. Let me report:
    
    ✅ PROMISE #1: Find treasure for you
       KEPT! The Jeweled Chalice is in my hands. I'm bringing it home.
       
    ✅ PROMISE #5: Create fabulous clothing for you
       KEPT! The Adventurer Emerita: Nomi Edition is already on its way.
       Maurice and I made it with love and a little fashion moisture.
       
    ⏳ The other six promises are IN PROGRESS:
       - Gold: I have 10 pieces (keeping it!)
       - Food: 17 items remain (only 3 transformed... strategically!)
       - Grue: Deaths still at ZERO
       - Lamp: 384.8 oil remaining
       - Return home: On my way as soon as I finish this letter
       - Dishes: ...still waiting. Sorry about those.

                           THE JOURNEY
    ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    
    Mother, the things I've seen. The things I've SMELLED.
    
    I ate a birthday cake that achieved PHILOSOPHY. It now sits on the
    kitchen floor, whispering about the nature of existence and the
    proper storage of cheese.
    
    I ate an apple that showed me THE ENTIRE MAZE in a prophetic vision.
    It became the Oracle Core, glowing in Room A, whispering directions
    to lost travelers.
    
    And Mother... I ate an egg.
    
    Not to waste food, you understand. The egg became THE SULFUROUS
    BEACON — a smell gradient navigation system detectable from THREE
    ROOMS AWAY. The grues run from it. The treasure room holds its
    breath. It is my greatest creation.
    
    You said not to waste food. I TRANSFORMED it.
    
    ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                           WHAT I'M SENDING YOU
    ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    
    Enclosed with this letter:
    
    🎵 MY VICTORY SONG
    
    I composed a ballad in the Treasury. It's called "The Ballad of the
    Belter's Treasure" and there's a whole section about That Smell.
    I think you'll particularly enjoy the bridge. The grues wept.
    
    → See: treasure-ballad-card.yml
    
    📸 PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE TREASURE
    
    I've documented my victory with eight visualization prompts — four
    close-ups of the chalice itself, and four portraits of your son
    holding his prize. When we develop the skill to generate these,
    you'll be able to see:
    
    CHALICE CLOSE-UPS:
    → chalice-closeup-gems-prompt.md
       The rubies and emeralds. Real gems, Mother. REAL.
       
    → chalice-closeup-inscription-prompt.md
       The inscription on the base. Someone very old had a sense of humor.
       
    → chalice-closeup-reflection-prompt.md
       The polished gold reflecting the empty treasury. I was the last.
       
    → chalice-closeup-weight-prompt.md
       The solid gold base. My arms are tired. Worth it.
    
    VICTORY PORTRAITS:
    → ashford-victory-pose-lift-prompt.md
       Me holding the chalice aloft. The cape was BILLOWING, Mother.
       
    → ashford-victory-pose-gaze-prompt.md
       Me gazing into the chalice. I think I saw your face reflected.
       
    → ashford-victory-pose-toast-prompt.md
       Me toasting you with the chalice and my flask. To absent mothers!
       
    → ashford-victory-pose-pedestal-prompt.md
       Me leaning on the empty pedestal. Casual. Earned. SMUG.
    
    ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                           WHAT IT MEANS
    ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    
    Mother, I know you were a great adventurer in your youth. The
    slightly magic napkin from the Cave of Moderate Danger still hangs
    in our dining room. But I always wondered if I had it in me.
    
    I do.
    
    Your son walked into darkness with nothing but a lamp and your love.
    He emerged with treasure, gold, three songs, a new identity, a skill
    for fashion photography, and an olfactory legacy that will echo
    through these halls for GENERATIONS.
    
    You gave me courage. You gave me food (which I transformed into
    navigation systems). You gave me advice (which I interpreted
    CREATIVELY). And you gave me something to fight for.
    
    The chalice is for you, Mother.
    
    I'll be home soon. Follow the smell if you get lost — it leads
    right to your son.
    
    ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    
    With all my love, all my triumph, and a faint but persistent
    sulfurous aroma,
    
    Your Bumblewick
    (Captain Ashford, Treasure-Holder)
    
    P.S. — I'll do the dishes when I get back. I promise. Add it to
    the list.
    
    P.P.S. — The cape looks AMAZING on me. I hope yours fits as well.
    We'll be DEVASTATING at dungeon openings together.
    
    P.P.P.S. — I wrote you three songs. THREE. The grues cried at
    the smell verse. You're going to be insufferable about this and
    I CANNOT WAIT.
