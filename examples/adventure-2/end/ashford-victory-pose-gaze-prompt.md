## Prompt

Medium shot of Captain Ashford in the Treasury, holding the Jeweled Chalice at chest height, gazing into its polished surface. Golden light reflects from the chalice onto his weathered face, softening his features. His expression is not triumphant here — it's reverent. Wondering. This is the moment AFTER the victory shout, when the magnitude of achievement settles in. His eye patch rests on his forehead. His Belter grin has softened to something more tender.

In the chalice's reflection, perhaps he sees not treasure, but Mother's face.

**Style:** Intimate character portrait. The quiet moment after the storm.

**Mood:** "Is this really happening? Did I really do this?"
