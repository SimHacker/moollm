## Prompt

Wide shot of Captain Ashford leaning casually against the now-empty pedestal that once held the Jeweled Chalice. The chalice is tucked under his arm like a football — casual, possessive, EARNED. His other hand rests on the pedestal's edge. His expression is a knowing, slightly smug smile. "This was here. Now it's HERE." His lamp hangs from his belt, still lit, no longer needed in the magical light but carried anyway.

The composition tells the story: empty pedestals in the background (the "loot-hoggers" got those), the ONE pedestal now empty (he got THIS one), and the treasure securely in the hero's possession.

**Style:** Environmental portrait with narrative architecture. The room tells half the story.

**Mood:** "Someone had to be last. I'm glad it was me."
