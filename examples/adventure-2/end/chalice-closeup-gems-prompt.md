## Prompt

Extreme macro close-up of a golden chalice's rim. Alternating rubies and emeralds catch a shaft of warm, magical light from above. The gold surface shows the patina of ages — this is REAL gold, ancient and significant. Each gem sparkles with internal fire. The rubies are deep blood-red, the emeralds forest-green. Focus on the craftsmanship, the tiny facets, the way light dances between the stones. Background is soft golden blur — the treasury's ambient glow.

**Style:** High-end product photography meets fantasy artifact documentation. Think museum catalog crossed with treasure hunter's journal.

**Mood:** "This is worth more than your entire village, and it KNOWS it."
