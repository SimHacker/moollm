## The Moment

Captain Ashford holds the Jeweled Chalice aloft. The gems catch the kitchen light,
scattering rainbows across Mother's tear-stained face. This is the treasure she 
sent him to find. This is Promise #1, fulfilled.

## Prompt

Captain Ashford kneeling before Mother, presenting a magnificent jeweled chalice 
with both hands. The chalice is ornate, covered in gems that scatter prismatic 
light across the scene.

Mother reaches out to touch it, expression somewhere between wonder and pride.
Both wear their matching Nomi capes — his space-black, hers purple with lightning.

The composition suggests a knight presenting tribute to a queen — but warmer,
more familial. This is a son showing his mother that he did what she asked.

**Style:** Dramatic chiaroscuro lighting focused on the chalice, softer light 
on the faces. Renaissance painting meets family portrait.

**Mood:** "I brought you treasure, Mother. Just like I promised."
