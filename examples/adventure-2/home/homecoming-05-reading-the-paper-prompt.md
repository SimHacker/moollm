## The Moment

Mother and Captain Ashford sit side by side at the kitchen table, the 
postmodern deconstruction paper spread between them. Mother is reading aloud,
eyebrows climbing higher with each sentence.

"The lamp deconstructs ITSELF?"

"It's Derrida, Mother. The lamp gets YOU."

They both burst out laughing.

## Prompt

Two figures seated at a kitchen table, leaning over a manuscript together.
The paper is titled "How to Deconstruct Almost Anything" (visible).

Mother is mid-laugh, one hand on the paper, the other on Ashford's arm.
Ashford is grinning, proud of his academic absurdity.

Their matching capes drape over the chairs. The Jeweled Chalice and gold 
coins are visible in the background, but the focus is on the shared moment
of intellectual silliness.

**Style:** Warm, intimate, the joy of sharing something ridiculous with 
someone who loves you. Reading glasses optional but charming.

**Mood:** "I wrote a PhD dissertation in a mushroom chamber. Mother approves."
