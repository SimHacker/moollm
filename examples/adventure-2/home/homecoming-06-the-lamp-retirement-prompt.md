## The Moment

The lamp — brass, still glowing a soft electric blue — is placed on the 
mantle above the kitchen fireplace. A place of honor. A retirement befitting
a hero.

Mother and Captain Ashford stand on either side, hands gently guiding it 
into position. Their expressions are solemn, grateful.

This lamp never went dark. This lamp kept its promise.

## Prompt

A brass lamp being ceremonially placed on a wooden mantle. The lamp glows 
a soft, ethereal blue — Premium Glow, the color of kept promises.

Two figures in capes — purple and black — stand on either side, hands 
gently supporting the lamp as it finds its resting place. Their expressions 
are reverent, grateful, as if honoring a fallen comrade (who didn't fall).

Firelight from below mingles with the lamp's blue glow.

**Style:** Ceremonial, reverent, the mundane elevated to sacred. A veteran's 
homecoming. A tool becoming a trophy.

**Mood:** "You served well, old friend. Rest now. You've earned it."
