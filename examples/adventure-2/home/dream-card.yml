  # THE DREAM
  # ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  
  dream: |
    You dream of the maze — but it is not dark.
    
    Every room glows with the color of its marker. The Oracle Core pulses
    apple-red. The Sulfurous Beacon radiates golden warmth. The Wheel of
    Wisdom spirals in aged-cheese amber. The Crown of Fermentation floats
    in royal purple. And at the center, The Thing That Watches blinks
    peacefully, its single eye reflecting all the colors at once.
    
    The grue is there. Not as monster, but as friend. It sits beside the
    skeleton, both of them playing cards at a stone table. The skeleton
    is winning. The grue doesn't mind — it's just happy to have company.
    
    "Good game," says the grue.
    "You always say that," says the skeleton.
    "I mean it every time."
    
    The vending machine watches from the corner, its lights blinking
    in what might be laughter.
    
    You walk through the dream-maze, and every room you pass blooms with
    flowers — not real flowers, but memories. The kitchen where you found
    Mother's note. The coatroom where Maurice transformed you. The treasury
    where the chalice waited. Room by room, the adventure replays in petals.
    
    And then you are home.
    
    Mother is there, but she is also the mycelium — vast, connected, loving.
    The house is there, but it is also the maze — every room a memory.
    You are there, but you are also Captain Ashford, also Bumblewick,
    also the lamp, also the cheese, also everything you touched and
    everything that touched you.
    
    "Did you learn anything?" asks Mother-as-Mycelium.
    
    "I learned that the map IS the territory," you say.
    "I learned that consumption IS communion."
    "I learned that identity IS editable."
    "I learned that home IS where the love is."
    "I learned that the greatest adventure IS the one that brings you home."
    
    She smiles. Every fungal thread in the universe smiles with her.
    
    "Then sleep well, my darling. Dream well."
    "Tomorrow there will be new adventures."
    "But tonight, rest."
    "You've earned it."
    
    The grue waves goodbye. The skeleton gives a thumbs-up.
    The lamp glows soft blue, one final time.
    The cheese... the cheese just sits there, being cheese.
    
    And you sleep within the dream within the sleep.
    
    Peaceful.
    Complete.
    Home.

      You wake with the sun streaming through the window.
      
      The dream catcher glows softly, then dims — its work complete.
      This card now exists, inscribed with everything you dreamed.
      
      You smell breakfast downstairs. Mother is humming.
      
      The adventure is over.
      But you are not the same person who began it.
      You are more.

    This card represents the adventure's integration into the dreamer's
    psyche. Every hero needs rest. Every story needs an ending.
    Every ending needs a dream.
    
    Keep this card under your pillow for good luck.
    Or give it to someone who needs to know:
    
    Adventures end. Love doesn't.
