## The Moment

The final photo. The one that will hang on the wall.

Mother and Captain Ashford, seated together, surrounded by every treasure,
every trophy, every artifact of the adventure.

The Jeweled Chalice. The gold. The lamp. The Gorgonzola Glaive. 
The notebook full of letters and songs. The matching capes.

A family portrait. A legacy portrait. A "we did it" portrait.

## Prompt

Formal family portrait composition:

**Center:** Mother (Petunia Fantastipants) and Captain Ashford (Bumblewick),
seated side by side, both wearing their Nomi capes — purple lightning 
and space-black cosmos.

**Surrounding them:**
- The Jeweled Chalice on a stand (left)
- A pile of 108 gold coins (table center)
- The brass lamp, glowing blue, on mantle above
- The Gorgonzola Glaive (displayed on wall, right)
- The open notebook showing letters, photos, songs
- A pie (partially eaten)
- In the very corner: a sink full of dishes (now clean!)

**Expressions:** Pride, contentment, love, a hint of mischief.

**Style:** Renaissance family portrait meets adventure catalog. Every item 
has a story. Every story is visible. This is the complete picture.

**Background:** The Fantastipants kitchen, warm and golden, the window 
showing Wobblebrook-upon-Squiggle at sunset.

**Mood:** "This is us. This is what we did. This is our adventure."
