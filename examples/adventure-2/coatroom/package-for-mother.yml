      contents: |
        Dear Mother,
        
        I did it. Promise #5, kept.
        
        This cape was designed by Maurice — they're a mannequin,
        but they understood you immediately when I described you.
        
        The shoulders are SUPPOSED to be that pointy.
        The lining has maps of caves you've conquered.
        The clasp plays an operatic note.
        
        I have a matching cape now. Space black, star charts.
        When you wear burgundy and I wear black, we rhyme.
        
        Mother, I became someone today. His name is Ashford.
        He's a Belter pirate captain who sings in the face of death.
        But underneath, he's still your Bumblewick.
        
        We're going to conquer dungeons TOGETHER.
        
        I love you.
        
        — Your son (in whatever form he takes)
        
        P.S. There's 8 promises. I've now kept one. Seven to go.
