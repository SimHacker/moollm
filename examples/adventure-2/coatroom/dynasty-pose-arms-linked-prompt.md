## Prompt

The Fantastipants dynasty, arm in arm, as if walking a red carpet to a dungeon opening. Casual confidence. Practiced elegance. A mother and son who have conquered caves and will conquer more.

**Captain Ashford** (left): Space-black Nomi cape draped perfectly, one arm linked through his mother's. Other hand casually resting on his belt near the flask. Slight swagger in his stance. Expression of roguish pride.

**Petunia Fantastipants** (right): Burgundy Nomi cape flowing elegantly, arm linked through her son's. Other hand holding the cape edge, showing off the cave map lining. Head high. Expression of regal confidence.

They're not just walking — they're ARRIVING.

**Style:** Red carpet photography. Fashion editorial. Dynasty portrait.

**Details to include:**
- Arms linked at the elbow, comfortable familiarity
- Both walking forward, mid-stride
- Capes flowing behind them in synchronized waves
- Black and burgundy creating visual harmony
- Both expressions confident but warm
- Matching geometric shoulders creating unified silhouette
- Sense of motion and destination

**Mood:** "We're here. You're welcome."
