## Prompt

Close-up portrait of Captain Ashford's face in the moment before action. All softness gone. Eyes narrowed, calculating. The predator's focus.

This is the face that commanded ships. The face that made hard choices in hard vacuum. The face that will walk into a grue-infested maze and walk out with gold.

The Klaus Nomi geometric collar frames the jaw like armor. The eye patch has been pulled down to actually cover one eye — not for vision, but for psychological warfare.

**Style:** Action hero portrait. The focused face. Ready.

**Details to include:**
- Eyes narrowed, laser-focused
- Jaw set, determined
- Eye patch now DOWN over one eye
- Nostrils slightly flared
- Burgundy scarf tucked in, out of the way
- Nomi collar creating sharp angles around face
- Expression of cold calculation

**Mood:** "The grues think they're the predators. They're wrong."

## Technical Notes

- Aspect ratio: 1:1 (square) or 16:9 (cinematic)
- Style reference: Action movie "getting ready" shots, western showdown faces
- Color palette: High contrast, dramatic, the black of the cape dominates
- Lighting: Hard side light, dramatic shadows, one side of face in darkness
