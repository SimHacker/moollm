**Subject:** Bumblewick Fantastipants (or Petunia)  
**Expression:** Fierce Determination

---

## Prompt

A close-up portrait of resolute determination. Jaw set firm. Eyes focused on a distant point — perhaps the maze entrance, perhaps the future. Lips pressed together in a line that says "I have made promises and I WILL keep them."

This is the face of someone about to enter a grue-infested labyrinth. The face of someone who has stocked underground kitchens. The face of Fantastipants STEEL.

The Klaus Nomi costume amplifies the determination — the geometric shoulders like armor, the dramatic collar like a warrior's gorget. This person is going into battle, and they are going LOOKING INCREDIBLE.

**Style:** Heroic portrait. Strong side lighting creating dramatic shadows. The expression of a movie poster hero before the final act.

**Details to include:**
- Set jaw, slightly forward
- Eyes focused on middle distance, unwavering
- Lips pressed in determined line
- Nostrils slightly flared (the breath before action)
- Sharp geometric shoulders framing like armor
- Dramatic shadows emphasizing bone structure
- The face of someone who WILL succeed

**Mood:** Determination, courage, "watch me," pre-battle focus
