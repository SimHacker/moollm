# Acquired through the Dynasty Photo Session (Move 12)

skill:
  name: PHOTO-SET-8
  learned_by: Maurice the Magnificent
  learned_on: Move 12
  teacher: Captain Ashford (through collaboration)
  
  description: |
    The art of composing a set of 8 visualization prompts, divided into
    two complementary types. This creates a complete "portfolio" of an
    entity, costume, or moment that can later be rendered by image
    generation tools or artists.
    
  structure:
    total_prompts: 8
    types: 2
    prompts_per_type: 4
    
    # Type combinations that work well:
    recommended_pairs:
      - ["pose", "expression"]           # Full body + face close-ups
      - ["portrait", "selfie"]           # Formal + casual
      - ["solo", "duo"]                  # Individual + with others
      - ["static", "action"]             # Posed + dynamic
      - ["wide", "detail"]               # Full scene + focused details

      sources:
        - character_backstory: "player.yml, persona files"
        - costume_details: "cape.yml, accessory files"
        - room_atmosphere: "ROOM.yml"
        - chat_history: "README.md narrative"
        - relationships: "Who else is involved?"

      considerations:
        - "What story are we telling?"
        - "Who is the audience?"
        - "What emotions to capture?"

      template: |
        Each prompt file MUST include:
        
        ## Context References
        - file_references: Links to YAML files (character, costume, room)
        - narrative_context: Quoted text from README, chat, letters
        - relationship_context: Other characters and their files
        
        ## Prompt
        - Subject description (from context files)
        - Pose or expression specification
        
        ## Style
        - Style references (traditions to draw from)
        - Mood/message summary
        
        ## Technical Notes
        - Aspect ratio, lighting, color palette

  invocation: |
    To request a photo set from Maurice:
    
    "Maurice, please create a PHOTO-SET-8 for [subject]
     using [type1] and [type2] prompt types."
    
    Or simply demonstrate by posing and Maurice will learn!

  future_integration: |
    This skill will connect with a Visualizer character who can:
    - Take these prompts and call image generation tools
    - Generate image sidecars next to the prompt files
    - Apply artistic traditions and style filters
    - Create variations and iterations

    Developed through the Dynasty Photo Session with Captain Ashford.
    Inspired by professional portrait photography, fashion editorials,
