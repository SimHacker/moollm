## Prompt

Captain Ashford stands on an imagined bridge, one hand gripping an invisible railing, the other pointing forward with authority. The pose of a captain giving orders — directing the ship, the crew, the future.

The space-black Nomi cape hangs heavy and still, adding gravitas. The geometric shoulders create the silhouette of rank, of authority earned through survival.

This is not the pirate Ashford was. This is the leader he became.

**Style:** Naval command portrait meets sci-fi bridge scene. Authority and vision. A man who has earned the right to point the way.

**Details to include:**
- One hand gripping (invisible railing, or belt)
- Other hand pointing forward, finger extended
- Stance wide, commanding presence
- Cape hanging straight, adding weight and authority
- Expression focused on middle distance — seeing the goal
- Compression suit visible, practical under the drama
- Subtle scars on hands visible

**Mood:** "I know the way. Follow me. We'll get there together."
