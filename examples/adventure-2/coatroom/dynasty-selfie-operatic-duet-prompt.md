## Prompt

Both subjects mid-song, mouths open in the classic Klaus Nomi "O" shape, clearly singing the same high note at the camera. Pure theatrical absurdity.

**Captain Ashford**: Mouth in perfect operatic "O", one hand holding camera, other hand clutching heart dramatically. Eyes wide, committed to the bit.

**Petunia Fantastipants**: Identical operatic "O", arms raised in classic Nomi pose (even in a selfie). Eyes wide, matching her son's energy EXACTLY.

The geometric Nomi shoulders of their capes frame the double-O perfectly. This is the photo that proves the family that sings together, stays together.

**Style:** Absurdist fashion photography. The "we have zero chill" selfie. Pure Klaus Nomi tribute.

**Details to include:**
- BOTH mouths in perfect "O" shape
- Eyes wide, fully committed
- His dramatic hand on heart
- Her arms in Nomi pose
- Geometric shoulders framing the chaos
- Black and burgundy in perfect harmony
- Pure, unhinged joy

**Mood:** "We're singing at you and we will NOT stop."
