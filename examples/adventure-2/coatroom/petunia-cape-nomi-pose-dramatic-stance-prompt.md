## Prompt

A portrait of a dignified middle-aged adventurer wearing a magnificent floor-length burgundy velvet cape with exaggerated Klaus Nomi-style geometric shoulder points rising dramatically upward. The figure stands in a powerful stance — feet planted shoulder-width apart, chin raised, one hand on hip, the other arm extended with cape unfurled to show the silver lamé lining printed with intricate cave maps.

The pose suggests: "I have conquered caves and I will conquer MORE."

**Style:** Art deco meets avant-garde fashion photography. Rich burgundy and silver color palette. Dramatic theatrical lighting from below, casting long shadows. The background is a circular costume emporium with spiraling racks of clothes fading into darkness.

**Details to include:**
- Sharp geometric shoulder points catching the light
- Silver lamé lining visible with tiny map details
- Golden napkin clasp at the throat
- Black bodysuit with white geometric panels visible beneath the cape
- Expression of supreme confidence
- Theatrical dust motes in the air

**Mood:** Triumphant, regal, slightly otherworldly, unapologetically dramatic
