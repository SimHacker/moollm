## Prompt

Two figures stand back to back in the classic "we've got each other's backs" pose.

**Captain Ashford** (left): Space-black Nomi cape, weathered leather coat beneath, burgundy silk scarf visible. Star chart lining catches light as cape drapes. Eye patch on forehead. Expression of determined readiness.

**Petunia Fantastipants** (right): Burgundy velvet Nomi cape with cave map lining in silver lamé. Black bodysuit with geometric panels. Crown of geometric spikes. Expression of fierce maternal pride.

Their capes' geometric shoulders create a unified silhouette — two points becoming four, like a crown of their own. The black and burgundy complement each other perfectly.

**Style:** Dynasty portrait. Power couple energy. Two generations of adventurers ready to face anything.

**Details to include:**
- Backs touching, shoulders aligned
- Both looking outward (covering all directions)
- Capes creating unified dramatic silhouette
- Color contrast: space black vs burgundy
- Star charts visible on his lining, cave maps on hers
- Both expressions fierce but warm
- Geometric shoulders creating crown-like outline

**Mood:** "Come at us. We dare you."
