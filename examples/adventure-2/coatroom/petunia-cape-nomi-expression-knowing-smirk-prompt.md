## Prompt

A close-up portrait focusing on the face and collar. The expression is a subtle, knowing smirk — one corner of the mouth lifted, eyes slightly narrowed with amusement, chin tilted down but gaze lifted to meet the viewer. This is the expression of someone who has conquered caves and knows they look FANTASTIC doing it.

The look says: "Yes, the shoulders ARE supposed to be that pointy. Any questions?"

One eyebrow is slightly raised, suggesting mild challenge mixed with warmth. There's wisdom in this face, and also mischief.

**Style:** Fashion editorial close-up. Moody lighting from one side. The expression is the star; costume elements support.

**Details to include:**
- Asymmetrical smirk, left side lifted
- One eyebrow raised
- Eyes sparkling with mischief
- Chin slightly lowered, gaze up through lashes
- Deep burgundy costume visible in lower frame
- Sharp shoulder point visible in peripheral
- Warm, knowing energy

**Mood:** Confident, playful, "I know something you don't know"
