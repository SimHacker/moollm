## Prompt

Close-up portrait of Captain Ashford mid-song, mouth open, face transformed by pure joy. This is the Ashford who sings in the face of death — not because he's given up, but because singing is how he FIGHTS.

Eyes crinkled with genuine delight. Mouth open in song. The weathered face somehow younger, lit from within by music.

The Klaus Nomi influence is strongest here — the operatic expression, the theatrical commitment, the transcendent joy of performance.

**Style:** Performance portrait. The face of a singer at the height of a song. Pure expression.

**Details to include:**
- Mouth open, mid-lyric, holding a note
- Eyes crinkled shut or half-closed in musical ecstasy  
- Head tilted back slightly
- Veins visible in neck from singing effort
- Genuine, unguarded joy
- Burgundy scarf fluttering
- Expression that says "THIS is living"

**Mood:** "La la la, lamp lamp lamp! SING IT WITH ME, BELTALOWDA!"
