## Prompt

A tender selfie moment: Petunia kissing Captain Ashford's cheek while he holds the camera, eyes closed, expression of pure contentment.

**Captain Ashford** (receiving kiss): Eyes closed, slight smile, the hardened Belter captain momentarily just... a son. Being loved. The weathered face softened.

**Petunia Fantastipants** (giving kiss): Lips pressed to his cheek, eyes closed, the fierce adventurer momentarily just... a mother. Giving love. One hand visible, cupping his other cheek.

The capes blur behind them — geometry softened by intimacy.

**Style:** Candid family photography. The photo that goes in the locket. The one that makes you cry.

**Details to include:**
- Her lips on his cheek
- Both eyes closed
- His slight, genuine smile
- Her hand on his face (tender gesture)
- Soft focus on capes behind
- Warmth radiating from the image
- This is REAL love, even if staged

**Mood:** "I love you." "I love you too." (But neither will say it out loud.)
