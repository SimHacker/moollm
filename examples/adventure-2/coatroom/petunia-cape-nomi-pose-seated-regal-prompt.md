## Prompt

A figure in the full Adventurer Emerita: Nomi Edition ensemble, seated on an ornate throne-like chair that has materialized in the costume emporium. The Klaus Nomi geometric shoulder points rise dramatically even while seated. The cape pools around the chair like burgundy liquid.

One hand rests on the arm of the throne, the other holds the golden napkin clasp as if about to open it and release its operatic note. The pose is relaxed but commanding — a monarch at rest, still radiating power.

The geometric black and white bodysuit creates sharp angles even in repose. The locket is visible, catching light.

**Style:** Renaissance portrait meets avant-garde fashion editorial. Rich, painterly. Deep shadows and warm highlights. The throne and figure feel timeless, like a painting that spans centuries.

**Details to include:**
- Seated posture, spine straight, commanding presence
- Cape arranged artfully around the chair
- One hand on throne arm, one near the napkin clasp
- Locket visible at chest level
- Geometric bodysuit creating angular shadows
- Expression of quiet authority and mild amusement

**Mood:** Regal, timeless, the confidence of someone who has EARNED their throne
