  description: |
    A weathered Belter captain with decades of hard vacuum written in every 
    line of his face. The long leather coat has seen things. The compression 
    suit has been patched more times than anyone can count. But the burgundy 
    silk scarf at his throat says: I have survived, and I have TASTE.
    
    He moves with the slight forward lean of someone used to thrust gravity.
    His eyes have seen the stars from the wrong side of an airlock.
    His voice carries the Belter patois like a song.
    
    Underneath it all: still Bumblewick. Still the spoon enthusiast and 
    Tuesday rhymer. But transformed by the role, empowered by the costume,
    ready to face grues with the confidence of someone who's faced the void.

  # The signature song
  signature_song:
    name: "The Ballad of Captain Kidd"
    note: |
      In The Expanse, Ashford sings this traditional ballad when facing
      what he believes is his death. It's haunting, defiant, and beautiful.
      
      Bumblewick-as-Ashford may sing the Victory Ballad instead, or learn
      this one, or compose new ones. The singing is the key.
