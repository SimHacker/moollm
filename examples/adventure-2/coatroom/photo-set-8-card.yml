  # SKILL DEFINITION
  
  skill:
    name: PHOTO-SET-8
    protocol: VISUALIZE
    
    description: |
      Create a portfolio of 8 visualization prompts for any subject,
      divided into two complementary types (pose/expression, portrait/selfie,
      solo/duo, etc.). Each prompt is a detailed markdown file ready for
      image generation tools.
      
    learned_from: Maurice the Magnificent
    learned_at: The Fantastipants Costume Emporium
    learned_by: Captain Ashford (Bumblewick Fantastipants)
    learned_on: Moves 9, 11, 12 of Adventure 2
    
    # The three stages
    play_learn_lift:
      play: |
        We posed! Maurice snapped! We tried poses, expressions, solos,
        duos, serious faces, silly faces. We PLAYED with image-making.
        
      learn: |
        Patterns emerged: 8 is a good number. Two types create contrast.
        Context matters — pull from YAML files for grounding. Big-endian
        naming clusters related files. Style traditions focus the vision.
        
      lift: |
        Now it's a CARD. Shareable. Teachable. Anyone who holds this card
        can invoke the PHOTO-SET-8 skill. Maurice learned it through us.
        We learned it through Maurice. Now Mother can learn it too.

  # SKILL RECIPE
  
  recipe:
    step_1:
      name: "Gather Context"
      action: "Read relevant YAML files and narrative"
      sources:
        - "Character/player files for backstory"
        - "Costume/accessory files for appearance"
        - "Room files for environment"
        - "Chat history / README for narrative moment"
        - "Skill files for capabilities"
        - "Relationship files for dynamics"
        
    step_2:
      name: "Choose Types"
      action: "Pick two complementary categories"
      pairs:
        - [pose, expression]
        - [portrait, selfie]
        - [solo, duo]
        - [static, action]
        - [formal, casual]
        
    step_3:
      name: "Compose 4 + 4"
      action: "Write 4 prompts for each type"
      structure: |
        Each prompt file MUST contain:
        
        1. CONTEXT REFERENCES SECTION:
           - file_references: Links to YAML files (character, costume, room), comments to modulate or transform the context
           - narrative_context: Quoted/summarized text from README or chat
           - relationship_context: Who else is involved, their files
           
        2. PROMPT SECTION:
           - Subject/costume description (from context files)
           - Specific pose or expression
           
        3. STYLE SECTION:
           - Traditions to draw from
           - Mood/message summary
           
        4. TECHNICAL SECTION:
           - Aspect ratio, lighting, color palette
        
    step_4:
      name: "Name & Organize"
      action: "Big-endian file naming"
      pattern: "{subject}-{type}-{variation}-prompt.md"
      
  # CONTEXT REFERENCE FORMAT
  
  context_reference_format:
    description: |
      Every prompt MUST include a context_references section that grounds
      the image in the microworld state. This creates lineage and allows
      future tools to auto-assemble context.
      
    required_sections:
      file_references:
        description: "Links to YAML files that define the subject"
        format: "Relative paths from prompt location"
        examples:
          - "../player.yml"
          - "./bumblewick-ashford-persona.yml"
          - "./ashford-nomi-cape.yml"
          - "../start/lamp.yml"
          
      narrative_context:
        description: "Quoted or summarized text from chat/README"
        format: "Direct quotes with source attribution"
        examples:
          - "From README Move 10: 'You turn to the mirror. Someone else looks back.'"
          - "Chat context: User requested 'Belter swagger with casual dominance'"
          
      relationship_context:
        description: "Other characters/objects in the scene"
        format: "Links to their files with role"
        examples:
          - "Maurice (photographer): ./mannequin.yml"
          - "Mother (subject of dynasty photo): ./maurice-as-petunia.yml"

  # DETAIL COHERENCE INTERLINKING (Learned Move 26!)
  
  detail_coherence:
    description: |
      When creating sets with OBJECT CLOSE-UPS and SUBJECT PORTRAITS,
      the portrait prompts should REFERENCE the close-up prompts to
      maintain visual coherence across the set!
      
    principle: |
      Close-ups establish canonical visual details (gem colors, surface
      textures, inscriptions, materials). Portrait shots must inherit
      these details so the same object looks CONSISTENT across all 8 images.
      
    technique: |
      In each portrait prompt, add a "Detail References" section linking
      to ALL close-up prompts, summarizing key visual details to maintain:
      
      ### 💎 [Object] Detail References (for visual coherence)
      
      | Close-up | Path | Details to Maintain |
      |----------|------|---------------------|
      | [Type 1] | `./closeup-1-prompt.md` | [Key visual details] |
      | [Type 2] | `./closeup-2-prompt.md` | [Key visual details] |
      | [Type 3] | `./closeup-3-prompt.md` | [Key visual details] |
      | [Type 4] | `./closeup-4-prompt.md` | [Key visual details] |
      
    example: |
      For the Treasury Victory Photos (Move 26), each portrait prompt
      references all 4 chalice close-ups to maintain consistency:
      
      - Gems: Rubies blood-red, emeralds forest-green, alternating
      - Inscription: Worn letters, ancient patina, hints of verdigris
      - Reflection: Polished convex surface, reflects environment
      - Weight: Thick solid gold base, substantial heft
      
      Now all 8 images will show the SAME CHALICE, even if generated
      by different models or at different times!

    learned_by: "Captain Ashford, now shared with all PHOTO-SET-8 holders"
    
    mantra: |
      "Close-ups define truth. Portraits inherit truth.
       Coherence is consistency across the set."
