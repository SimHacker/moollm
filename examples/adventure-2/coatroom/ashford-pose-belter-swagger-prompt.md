## Prompt

A full-body portrait of Captain Ashford in the signature Belter stance — weight shifted to one hip, thumbs hooked in belt, chin raised with casual confidence. The weathered leather coat hangs open, revealing the compression suit beneath. The burgundy silk scarf drapes artfully.

Over his shoulders: a floor-length space-black velvet cape with Klaus Nomi geometric shoulder points lined in burgundy. The cape pools slightly at his feet.

The pose says: "I've survived hard vacuum, pirate wars, and redemption arcs. This maze? This maze is nothing."

**Style:** Sci-fi western meets avant-garde fashion. The Belt meets Klaus Nomi. Utilitarian spacer gear elevated by dramatic couture.

**Details to include:**
- Thumbs hooked in heavy leather belt
- Weight on one hip, relaxed dominance
- Weathered leather coat open, scarf visible
- Nomi cape creating dramatic silhouette
- Eye patch pushed up on forehead
- Silver flask visible at belt
- Expression of earned confidence
- Slight forward lean (thrust gravity habit)

**Mood:** "I've seen things. I've done things. And I look GOOD doing this."
