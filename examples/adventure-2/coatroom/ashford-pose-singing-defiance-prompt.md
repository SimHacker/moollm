## Prompt

Captain Ashford mid-song, head thrown back, arms spread wide, the space-black Nomi cape unfurled behind him like wings. This is the signature Ashford moment — singing when everything is falling apart, because what else is there to do?

The Klaus Nomi geometric shoulders create sharp silhouettes. The silver lamé lining of the cape catches light as it billows. The burgundy scarf streams in an unseen wind.

He's not singing to anyone. He's singing to EVERYTHING. To the void. To the grues. To fate itself.

**Style:** Operatic defiance. The moment before the hero faces impossible odds. Equal parts concert and last stand.

**Details to include:**
- Head thrown back, mouth open in song
- Arms spread wide, Christ-like but defiant
- Cape unfurled, creating wing-like silhouette
- Star chart lining visible as cape spreads
- Eye patch still on forehead (never covers the eye)
- Feet planted firmly, rooted despite drama
- Expression of fierce joy — this is who he IS

**Mood:** "You want to take me? Take me SINGING."
