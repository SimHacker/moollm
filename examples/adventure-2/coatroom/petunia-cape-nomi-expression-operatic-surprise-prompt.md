**Expression:** Operatic Surprise

---

## Prompt

A close-up portrait focusing on the face and dramatic collar of the Nomi Edition costume. The expression is one of theatrical surprise — eyebrows raised high, mouth forming a perfect "O", eyes wide with delighted shock. This is not real surprise; this is OPERA surprise. This is Klaus Nomi hitting that impossible high note.

The art deco collar rises behind the head like a halo, framing the face. The geometric shoulder points are visible at the edges of frame, creating sharp visual anchors.

The expression suggests: "You're telling me there's TREASURE at the end of this maze?!"

**Style:** Close-up fashion portrait with theatrical expression. Sharp focus on the face, softer focus on costume elements. Ring light reflection in the eyes.

**Details to include:**
- Exaggerated theatrical surprise expression
- Eyebrows raised dramatically
- Mouth in perfect "O" shape
- Eyes wide, catching light
- Art deco collar framing face
- Geometric shoulders at frame edges
- Skin catching warm light, suggesting the glow of self-discovery

**Mood:** Theatrical delight, the joy of embracing drama, pure commitment to the bit
