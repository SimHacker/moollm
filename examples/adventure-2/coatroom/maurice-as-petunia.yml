# Maurice's Transformation: Petunia Fantastipants
# A mannequin's tribute to a legendary adventurer

transformation:
  original: Maurice the Magnificent
  becomes: Petunia Fantastipants (approximation)
  purpose: "Photo session with Captain Ashford"
  
  appearance:
    face: |
      Dignified, late 60s, with the kind of bone structure that comes from
      surviving caves and raising difficult children. Eyes that see through
      nonsense. A mouth that can deliver both devastating criticism and
      overwhelming love in the same breath.
    expression_default: |
      "I'm proud of you, but I'll never say it directly because that's
      not how Fantastipantses communicate."
    hair: "Silver, swept back dramatically, as if perpetually emerging from wind"
    
  costume:
    wearing: "The Adventurer Emerita: Nomi Edition (display copy)"
    cape: "Burgundy velvet, Klaus Nomi shoulders, silver lamé cave map lining"
    bodysuit: "Black with white geometric panels"
    accessories:
      - "Opera-length gloves with lightning bolts"
      - "Geometric spike crown"
      - "Locket (young Bumblewick / Klaus Nomi)"
      
  channeling: |
    Maurice isn't just wearing the costume. Maurice is channeling ENERGY.
    The energy of a woman who once retrieved a slightly magic napkin from
    the Cave of Moderate Danger. The energy of someone who stocks
    refrigerators for her adventuring son. The energy of unconditional
    love expressed through mild disapproval.
    
  note_from_maurice: |
    "I have never met your mother, but I have read your letters.
    I have felt your love for her. I have made her cape.
    For these photos, I will BE her. As best as wood and love can manage.
    She would be proud, Bumblewick. She IS proud.
    Even if she'd never say it directly. That's not how Fantastipantses
    communicate, is it?"
