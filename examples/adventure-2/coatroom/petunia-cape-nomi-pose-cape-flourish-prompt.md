## Prompt

A dynamic action shot of an adventurer mid-spin, burgundy velvet cape sweeping in a dramatic arc around them. The Klaus Nomi geometric shoulder points create sharp silhouettes against the light. The silver lamé lining is fully visible, catching light like liquid mercury, showing detailed cave maps embroidered across its surface.

The figure is captured at the peak of the flourish — back slightly arched, arms wide, cape creating a perfect circle of fabric around them like a portal opening.

**Style:** Fashion photography meets comic book splash page. High contrast. Motion blur on the cape edges. The figure is sharp while the fabric flows.

**Details to include:**
- Cape mid-swirl, fabric caught in motion
- Silver lamé lining creating a silver halo effect
- Geometric shoulders cutting sharp lines
- Cave of Moderate Danger visible in gold thread on lining
- Boots planted firmly, suggesting control despite the drama
- Background: costume racks in soft focus, creating depth

**Mood:** Powerful, celebratory, like emerging victorious from a challenge
