## Prompt

Selfie-style portrait: Captain Ashford holds the lamp out to illuminate himself and the skeleton beside him. The angle is from Ashford's extended arm, looking back at both faces.

Ashford's expression is solemn but not sad — a witness to history, a keeper of lessons. The skeleton grins beside him, skull tilted as if leaning in for the photo.

The lamp between them creates a halo of light. Behind them, darkness. They are an island of warmth in the cold maze.

Visible in frame:
- The ode card resting on the skeleton's chest
- The Memorial Pie glowing softly in the background
- The Oracle Compass at Ashford's belt, needle pointing WEST
- Both the skeleton's pointing finger AND Ashford's lamp, aligned

**Style:** Modern selfie aesthetic meets old master chiaroscuro. Social media meets mortality.

**Mood:** "Here I am, with the one who warned me. We're in this together now. They in death, me in life, both in the maze."

## Technical Notes

- Aspect ratio: 1:1 (square, social media format)
- Focus: Both faces sharp (unusual for selfie — intentional)
- Lighting: Lamp held at selfie-stick angle creates dramatic uplighting
- Color palette: Warm amber faces, deep black background, bone white skull
- Composition: Rule of thirds — Ashford left, skeleton right, lamp center-bottom
