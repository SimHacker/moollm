  salutation: "Dearest Mother,"
  
  body: |
    I have found someone who didn't make it.
    
    They sit here in Room I, bones arranged in the pose they fell,
    hand pointing west toward Room J — the lamp oil vendor. They
    were ONE ROOM AWAY from salvation. Their lamp ran out in the
    cold room. They couldn't see. They couldn't run.
    
    I don't know their name. Their note was half-eaten:
    
    "I should have brought more food to mark the rooms. I dropped
    the cheese in room B and the bread in room D but then I got
    confused and—"
    
    That's all. The grue got the rest. Got them, too.
    
    But I know their MISTAKE, Mother. And it's important.
    
    They used GOLD COINS to mark rooms.
    
    Gold. GOLD! Beautiful, shiny, valuable, utterly useless for
    navigation gold. Every coin looks the same. They couldn't tell
    Room B from Room D from Room F. They got lost in their own
    breadcrumb trail — except the breadcrumbs were indistinguishable.
    
    YOUR method — the food — works. Each marker is unique. Each one
    TRANSFORMS and SPEAKS. The Wheel of Wisdom in Room C gives
    different advice than the Eternal Crumb in Room B. The Crown of
    Fermentation in Room E reigns over different territory than the
    Sulfurous Beacon in Room D.
    
    The skeleton had over 100 gold. They dropped most of it in Room F
    when their lamp died. They kept only three coins — all they had
    on them when they ran blind through the darkness.
    
    I've taken those three coins. I'll use them at the vendor. The
    vendor they never reached. One room away. ONE ROOM.
    
    I wrote them an ode. Seven stanzas about their journey, their
    mistake, and their gift to me. I placed it on their chest.
    
    I took photographs. Four close-ups of their final possessions —
    the pointing hand, the unfinished note, the empty lamp, the three
    coins. Four portraits of me honoring them — saluting, reading the
    ode aloud, showing them my compass, and a vigil selfie together.
    
    They're enclosed, Mother. Look at them. Remember this soul.
    
    Their lesson:
    - Bring FOOD, not coins (food transforms, gold stays the same)
    - The cold room drains oil FAST (Room F is dangerous)
    - The vendor is WEST from here (one room that way)
    - Almost isn't enough (they were SO CLOSE)
    
    I won't "almost" make it, Mother. I have your wisdom. I have your
    food markers. I have the Oracle Compass crystallized from my
    prophetic apple vision. And now I have their lesson too.
    
    The skeleton is pointing the way. I'm following their finger.
    WEST to the vendor. I'll buy oil. I'll tell them about this
    adventurer who almost made it.
    
    With love, respect, and a heavier heart,
    
  closing: "Your Bumblewick (Captain Ashford, Still Alive)"
  
  postscript: |
    P.S. — Their skeleton seems SMUG about knowing the way out.
    Skeletons are like that. Lacking lips but full of attitude.
    
    P.P.S. — I named the pie I left here "The Memorial Pie." It's
    watching over them now. Tuesday's shepherd's pie, transformed
    into a tiny mausoleum of mashed potato and lamb. You'd approve.
