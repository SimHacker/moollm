## Prompt

Captain Ashford kneels on the cold stone floor, cape pooled around him like dark water. He holds a card in both hands — the Ode to the Lost Explorer — and reads aloud to the skeleton.

The skeleton sits against the wall, eye sockets seeming to watch. The lamp rests on the ground between them, creating an intimate circle of light. Shadows dance on the walls.

Ashford's expression is soft, vulnerable — not the swaggering Belter captain, but Bumblewick the tender-hearted poet. His lips move around the words:

*"Here lies a soul who ventured deep, Into the maze where grues do creep..."*

The Memorial Pie in the background seems to lean in, listening.

**Style:** Renaissance religious painting meets fantasy adventure. Sacred moment in profane space.

**Mood:** "Words for the dead, from the living. A bridge across the final silence."

- Focus: Sharp on Ashford and card, skeleton slightly soft
- Lighting: Lamp on ground creates low, dramatic lighting
- Color palette: Warm orange on faces, deep blue-black shadows, pale bone
- Composition: Low angle, looking up at Ashford and across at skeleton
