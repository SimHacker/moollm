## Prompt

Medium shot of Captain Ashford crouching beside the skeleton, holding the Oracle Compass toward the skull's face. The compass glows with inner light — the Little Oracle inside pulses with recognition.

Both compass and skeleton's finger point in the same direction: WEST.

Ashford's expression is one of bittersweet connection. He speaks to the skeleton:

*"See? I know the way now. Because of you. Because of your pointing finger. Because of your mistake. You taught me, even in death. The compass holds your lesson: gold cannot guide you. Food can. Always bring oil. Never trust the cold room."*

The skeleton grins its eternal grin. For once, it doesn't seem smug. It seems... proud?

**Style:** Buddy adventure meets memorial portrait. Connection across mortality.

**Mood:** "You showed me the way. Now I carry your wisdom in my pocket. It talks to me."
