## Prompt

Full-body portrait of Captain Ashford in the Skeleton's Chamber. He stands at rigid attention — back straight, chin raised, one hand holding his lit lamp high, the other raised in a formal Belter salute (fist to heart, then extended outward).

Before him, the skeleton slumps against the wall, bathed in the lamp's warm light. The skeleton's pointing hand catches the glow. The Memorial Pie sits nearby.

Ashford's space-black Nomi cape hangs still — there's no breeze here, only solemnity. His expression is respectful, serious. This isn't a joke. This is honor.

The Oracle Compass at his belt glows faintly, needle pointing WEST — the direction the skeleton's finger also indicates.

**Style:** Military portrait meets fantasy adventure. Formal honor in an informal setting.

**Mood:** "I see you. I respect you. I will learn from you. I will not make your mistakes."
