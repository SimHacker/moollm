### Narrative Context
> *"Their bony fingers still clutch a note that reads: 'I should have brought more food to mark the rooms. I dropped the cheese in room B and the bread in room D but then I got confused and—' The note ends there. A cautionary tale."*
> — ROOM.yml

### The Story
The explorer realized their mistake — too late. They were writing a warning, perhaps hoping someone would find it. Something (grue?) ate part of the note along with them.

## Prompt

Close-up of aged, yellowed parchment clutched in skeletal fingers. The note is torn diagonally, edges ragged and discolored — clearly something CHEWED it.

Visible text (in cramped, increasingly desperate handwriting):

```
I should have brought more food
to mark the rooms. I dropped the
cheese in room B and the bread
in room D but then I got confused
and—
```

The writing gets shakier toward the end. The final dash trails off into nothing as the paper is torn away.

Lamplight catches the ink, making some letters glint. Water damage (or tears?) has caused some smudging.

**Style:** Medieval manuscript meets crime scene evidence. Documentary but emotional.

**Mood:** "A warning that arrived too late for its author, but just in time for us."
