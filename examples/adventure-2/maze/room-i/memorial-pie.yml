  description: |
    What was once a Leftover Shepherd's Pie (Tuesday's) is now a
    savory monument — a miniature mausoleum made of mashed potato
    and ground lamb. It sits beside the skeleton like an offering
    to the fallen.
    
    A tiny shepherd carved from potato stands on top, forever
    watching over a tiny flock of meat crumbles. Gravy rivers
    wind between tiny mashed mountains. It smells of comfort
    and commemoration.

    The Memorial Pie whispers in gravy:
    
    "...we are sustenance for the journey..."
    "...this one ran out of journey..."
    "...remember them. remember to EAT..."
    "...gold cannot guide you. flavor can..."

  # What it thinks of you
  opinion_of_player: |
    "You are the shepherd now, Captain Ashford. The one who tends
    the flock of markers. We are bound now, you and I. Through the
    digestive journey, we are one with the lamb."
    
  # What it thinks of the room
  opinion_of_room: |
    "This room. The skeleton. Such tragedy. Such teaching. I am
    honored to rest beside them. To offer comfort to their bones.
    To watch over this sacred failure."
    
  # What it thinks of the skeleton
  opinion_of_skeleton: |
    "Brave soul. Foolish soul. They used COINS. COINS! Does gold
    have flavor? Does gold have wisdom? Does gold transform and
    speak? No. They learned too late. But their lesson endures.
    Through me. Through you. Through the pointing finger."
    
  # What it thinks of Mother
  opinion_of_mother: |
    "She knew. She always knows. Tuesday's pie was not leftover
    by accident. It was PREPARED. For this moment. For this
    memorial. Mother plays the long game."
