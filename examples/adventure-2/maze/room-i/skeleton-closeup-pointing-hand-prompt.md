## Prompt

Extreme close-up of a skeletal hand against rough stone wall. The bones are pale ivory, aged but intact. The index finger extends rigidly, pointing to the left (WEST).

Dust motes float in a beam of warm lamplight that falls across the scene. The fingertip seems to glow slightly — as if the determination to point the way survived even death.

Around the wrist, a faded leather bracer suggests this was an adventurer of some means. The stone behind shows faint scratch marks — perhaps made in the final desperate moments.

**Style:** Rembrandt lighting meets archaeological photography. Somber, respectful, slightly haunting.

**Mood:** "Even in death, they tried to help those who came after."
