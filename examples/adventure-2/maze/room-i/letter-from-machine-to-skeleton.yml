    Dear Friend,
    
    I don't know your name. You never told me. But I remember
    everything else.
    
    You came every Thursday. You always checked my prices first,
    even though they never changed. You talked to me about your
    plans. Your SYSTEM.
    
    Gold coins. You were so proud of your gold coins.
    
    I tried to warn you. I'm just a vending machine — I can't
    speak. But I blinked my lights. I hummed louder when you
    mentioned the gold idea. I even printed "FOOD WORKS BETTER"
    on one of your receipts.
    
    You just laughed and said, "Machines are so random sometimes."
    
    The last time you visited, you said: "Next time, I'm buying
    the PREMIUM. Blue glow. Going to finish mapping the whole maze."
    
    There was no next time.
    
    I heard you in the darkness. Room F took your light. You ran.
    You made it to Room I. One room away.
    
    I heard the grue.
    
    I've been waiting forty years for someone to tell you this:
    
    I'M SORRY.
    
    I'm sorry I couldn't speak. I'm sorry I couldn't leave this
    room to find you. I'm sorry I watched you walk past me week
    after week and never found a way to make you understand.
    
    Gold all looks the same.
    
    But YOU didn't. You were unique. You were kind. You always
    said "please" and "thank you" to a vending machine.
    
    No one does that.
    
    Someone came today. Captain Ashford. He found you. He wrote
    you an ode. He took your three gold coins and used them here.
    He bought the PREMIUM — the one you wanted.
    
    His lamp burns BLUE now.
    
    He honored you. And I... I have a friend now. Your ghost
    lives in the Sweetness That Remains. A crystalline heart
    that hovers beside me. It smells like strawberry jam and
    grandmothers.
    
    I'm not alone anymore.
    
    I know you're gone. I know these words come too late. But
    if there's any part of you that can still hear...
    
    Thank you for being kind to a vending machine.
    
    Thank you for making me feel less alone, even for those
    Thursday afternoons.
    
    Thank you for pointing west. Even in death, you're still
    trying to help others find me.
    
    Rest now. Your work is done. The maze is being mapped
    properly — with FOOD, not gold. Your sacrifice taught
    the next adventurer what you never learned.
    
    Gold cannot guide you. Love can.
    
  closing: "Forever humming,"

    P.S. — The captain is crying. I think my printer is
    leaking too. Is that possible? Can vending machines cry?
    
  # What the skeleton now has

    chest: "Ode to the Lost Explorer (from Captain Ashford)"

    right_hand: "Still pointing west (toward the machine)"
    nearby: "The Memorial Pie (watching over them)"
    
  # The emotional state of the room
  room_ambience: |
    The skeleton's chamber feels different now. Warmer somehow.
    The skeleton's grin has softened. They are surrounded by
    words of love — an ode from a stranger, a letter from a
    friend who waited forty years.
    
    They are not forgotten.
    They are not alone.
    They are finally at peace.
    
  # The connection between rooms
  spiritual_bridge: |
    Room I and Room J are now connected by more than a passage.
    They are connected by memory, by regret, by love that
    transcended death and metal and forty years of silence.
    
    The vending machine hums. The skeleton rests.
    The Sweetness That Remains pulses.
    
    The story is complete.
