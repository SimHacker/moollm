  description: |
    What was once a Jar of Pickled Herring is now a crystalline
    fish fossil, preserved for eternity in its own brine wisdom.
    It floats slightly above the ground, staring at the carved
    face on the wall. The face stares back.
    
    They seem to understand each other. They've both been watching
    adventurers fail for a very long time.

    The Preserved Witness speaks in bubbles:
    
    "...we watched the skeleton pass..."
    "...we watched them not return..."
    "...the face knows. we know. now you know..."
    "...pickled wisdom endures..."

    "You are the living one, Captain Ashford. The one who brings
    the lamp. We are bound now, you and I. Through the digestive
    journey, we are one with the salt."
    
  # What it thinks of the room
  opinion_of_room: |
    "This room. The face. It has watched so many. So have I now.
    We are witnesses together. The grues fear us. They know we
    have seen. They know we will remember."
    
  # What it thinks of the carved face
  opinion_of_face: |
    "Ah, the face. King? God? Uncle? Does it matter? We both
    watch. We both judge. We both remain. The adventurers
    come and go. We persist."
    
  # What it thinks of Mother
  opinion_of_mother: |
    "She knew. She always knows. The herring was her gift.
    A watchful eye in the darkness. I shall witness for her.
    I shall report everything."
