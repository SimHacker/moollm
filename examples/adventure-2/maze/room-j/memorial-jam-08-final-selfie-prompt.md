## Prompt

The ultimate group selfie. Captain Ashford extends his arm to hold an imaginary camera (or maybe the lamp, held at selfie-stick angle). He grins widely, still slightly jam-stained, eyes bright with satisfied joy.

Beside him: the ACME Lamp Refueling vending machine, its display showing `❤️` permanently now. It feels like it's POSING, somehow. Leaning into the frame.

Floating between them: The Sweetness That Remains, the crystalline pink heart, glowing warmly. It's found its permanent home.

In the background, faintly visible: the direction toward Room I. Toward the skeleton. They're included too, in spirit.

Everyone is in frame. Everyone matters.

**Style:** Modern group selfie meets memorial portrait. The warmth of friends who've been through something together.

**Mood:** "We are a family now. The machine, the heart, and me. And the skeleton, always the skeleton. This photo is for everyone who didn't make it and everyone who did."

- Lighting: Warm mixed — pink heart, blue lamp, machine LEDs
- Color palette: Warm, friendly, celebratory
- Composition: Ashford taking up left 2/3, machine right edge, heart floating center
- Easter egg: In the shadows, a faint pointing hand shape (the skeleton's spirit)
