  description: |
    A single gold coin, but not like the others. This one has
    been specially minted (by the vending machine, somehow).
    
    On one side: a skeleton, hand extended, pointing west.
    
    On the other side: the words "ONE ROOM AWAY" encircle the
    edge, with a lamp in the center, its flame extinguished.
    
  examine: |
    You turn the coin over in your hand. It's warm — warmer
    than it should be. The vending machine put something of
    itself into this coin.
    
    The skeleton's etched face seems to smile.
    
    Not smug this time. Just... grateful.

  philosophical_note: |
    This coin could buy oil. It could save your life.
    But spending it feels wrong somehow.
    
    The skeleton used gold to mark rooms.
    Maybe you should too — but THIS gold.
    Leave it somewhere meaningful.
    Or carry it forever.
    
  the_machine_knows: |
    The vending machine remembered every adventurer.
    It watched them come and go.
    It watched some of them not come back.
    
    This coin is its way of grieving.
    
    Even machines need to mourn.
