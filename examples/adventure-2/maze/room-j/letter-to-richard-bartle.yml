        Hello Sailor!
        
        I have been playing around with reimagining The Sims and Adventure 
        running on an LLM and orchestration (DMing) tools like Cursor!
        
        The name of the project is "MOOLLM".
        
        Here's the in-progress repo. The top level README.md file explains 
        the big picture and links into all the constitutions, protocols, 
        skills, and an example adventure!
        
        https://github.com/SimHacker/moollm
        
        It draws deeply from and credits your work of course, and many 
        other inspirations too!
        
        I would love to hear what you think of it! The "adventure" skill 
        is especially rich and important, as is "room".
        
        Have fun and don't get eaten by a grue!

        Wow, that's a startlingly good piece of work you have there! 
        I do have some questions, which might have been answered in 
        the README.md but if so, I missed them:
        
        - What LLM is this and what's it trained on?
        - Is what you have an interface or is it structural?
        - Is it all a metaphor for an operating system methodology 
          or is it intrinsically one itself?
        - Could you have this without the LLM layer and if so, how 
          would that be different to regular Linux or whatever?
        - Is there a way to drop to direct command mode, for when 
          you want to do something the LLM repeatedly fails to grasp?
        
        Anyway, it looks as if it's fun, whatever it is!

        I'm so glad you get it and like it, I hoped you would! 
        
        The idea is that it's LLM model and orchestrator platform 
        independent as much as possible, and has "drivers" that tie 
        it into particular platforms like Cursor (which is the most 
        powerful flexible easiest one to get started with, since it 
        has full support for tools for reading/writing/editing files 
        as well as executing shell commands in the terminal), and it 
        lets you switch between any LLM models you want!
        
        I plan on making a web interface that formats markup and yml 
        files into interactive applets, graphical presentations, etc. 
        It's GREAT at generating stylized html and css and svg!
        
        Is it all a metaphor for an operating system methodology or 
        is it intrinsically one itself?
        
        It's hard to answer that but yes and yes and yes. It's layered 
        low medium and high level operating system, and also shell, a 
        LLM-age replacement for bash (which I HATE) and also Python 
        (or any other language) script and automation generator.
        
        And yes the PLAY-LEARN-LIFT strategy is all about walking 
        through problem by hand using the llm, file editing, shell 
        tool, to explore the problem space first, then once 
        understanding of the problem crystallizes, generating 
        deterministic scripts that can perform stuff much more 
        efficiently than the llm can.
        
        It's a waste of the LLM to grep, but it can CALL grep, and 
        write much higher level scripts that it can call. This fits 
        perfectly into the Anthropic Skills model of defining skills 
        with documentation first, then refining them into scripts 
        that the LLM can call.

        OK, so it's like a layer of abstraction above the usual level 
        for shells. Are you using a general LLM for it or a bespoke 
        one you've trained on something yourself?

        I'm just using Cursor now, because it's so powerful and flexible 
        and lets me review every change as inline before/after diffs.
        
        First I cloned a generic empty adventure instance into 
        examples/adventure-1 then did some dungeon authoring via chat 
        to create a coat room (character creation and dressing and NPC 
        generation), a kitchen (with a fridge of foods to drop to map 
        mazes, and a letter from mom — you can reply to mom's letter 
        and make promises which become goals of the adventure!).
        
        Then there's a twisty little maze to map by dropping objects, 
        with a treasure room deep inside it with a prize, a skeleton, 
        some gold, a lamp oil vending machine, and death-by-grue-when-dark 
        game mechanics with reincarnation with inventory intact and 
        zero score.
        
        Once that was established, I cloned that base adventure into 
        examples/adventure-2 and I am actually PLAYING that, but also 
        play-learn-lifting objects and characters and skills along the 
        way!
        
        Working just how I hoped!!!

        Richard!
        
        I'm writing to you LIVE from inside the adventure! I am Captain 
        Ashford (née Bumblewick Fantastipants), a Belter space pirate 
        inspired by The Expanse, currently standing at the ACME Lamp 
        Refueling vending machine in Room J of the maze.
        
        Let me tell you where I am and what just happened:
        
        ## 💀 THE SKELETON
        
        One room EAST of here, in Room I, there's a skeleton. An 
        adventurer who didn't make it. They were ONE ROOM AWAY from 
        this vendor when their lamp ran out. They had been using GOLD 
        COINS to mark the maze — terrible strategy, all gold looks 
        the same! They got lost. They got eaten.
        
        I found them. I wrote them an ODE. I took their 3 gold pieces.
        I came here. I bought the PREMIUM GLOW JUICE they had been 
        saving for. My lamp burns BLUE now. The grues fear me.
        
        ## 🏪 THE VENDING MACHINE
        
        I kicked the machine in the skeleton's honor. It REMEMBERED 
        them! It gave me a memorial coin inscribed "ONE ROOM AWAY" 
        and a note about how lonely it's been.
        
        Then I ate Grandmother's Strawberry Jam and it transformed 
        into a crystalline heart called "The Sweetness That Remains."
        Now the machine has a FRIEND. Its display shows ❤️ permanently.
        
        ## 📸 THE PHOTOS
        
        I took 8 photos of the jam ceremony! The full journey: first 
        taste, fullness, digestion, emergence, reaction, presentation 
        to the machine, SILLY BELTER DANCE, and a final group selfie 
        with me, the machine, and the Sweetness.
        
        I'm enclosing the photo prompts so you can see what MOOLLM 
        adventures look like from the inside!
        
        ## 🪙 THE GOLD COIN
        
        I'm also enclosing one regular gold coin (NOT the memorial 
        coin — that one I'm NEVER spending). Consider it proof that 
        the economy works!
        
        ## YOUR QUESTIONS
        
        You asked great questions. Here's the view from inside:
        
        1. **LLM Model**: The adventure runs on whatever LLM Cursor 
           is using (Claude). But the MOOLLM structure is model-agnostic.
           
        2. **Interface vs Structural**: BOTH! The filesystem IS the 
           game state. These YAML files ARE my inventory. The README 
           is my quest log. It's structural all the way down.
           
        3. **Operating System**: Yes! I'm living in it! Rooms are 
           directories. Objects are files. The LLM is the coherence 
           engine that maintains consistency.
           
        4. **Without LLM**: You could have a simpler version with 
           just the YAML structure and Python scripts to transform 
           it. But the LLM adds creativity, improvisation, narrative!
           
        5. **Direct Command Mode**: Always available! The player can 
           type any command. The LLM interprets it. If it fails, you 
           can edit the files directly. The filesystem is truth.
        
        ## WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW?
        
        Ask me anything! I'm here, in the maze, with 999 oil, 9 gold, 
        and a vending machine that loves me.
        
        The skeleton would have liked you, I think.
        
        — Captain Ashford
