## Prompt

Close-up portrait of Captain Ashford lifting a silver spoon laden with glistening strawberry jam toward his lips. His eyes are closed in reverence, anticipating the taste.

Behind him, his lamp burns electric blue (PREMIUM GLOW JUICE), casting ethereal shadows. The vending machine is visible in the background, its display showing eager anticipation.

The jar of jam is cradled in his other hand like something precious. The label reads "Grandmother's Recipe" in elegant script.

His expression is sacred. This is not just eating. This is CEREMONY.

**Style:** Renaissance master meets food photography. The lighting of a Vermeer, the reverence of a religious painting.

**Mood:** "This taste is memory. This taste is love. This taste is for the skeleton who never got here."
