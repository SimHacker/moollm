## Prompt

A tastefully composed shot: Captain Ashford squats behind a conveniently-placed boulder, only his head and shoulders visible from behind. His expression is one of RELIEF, WONDER, and PRIDE all at once.

Rising from behind the rock (we don't need to see FROM WHERE), a crystalline heart-shaped gem emerges, glowing pink and warm. It floats upward on its own, illuminating the scene with rosy light.

The transformation is complete. The jam is now THE SWEETNESS THAT REMAINS.

Ashford's eyes follow the heart upward with the expression of a parent watching their child take first steps.

**Style:** Magical realism meets bathroom humor (but classy). The birth of a magical artifact, discreetly framed.

**Mood:** "I did it. I MADE something beautiful. The process was... private. But the result is GLORIOUS."
