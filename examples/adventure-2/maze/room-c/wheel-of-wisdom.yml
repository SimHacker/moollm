  description: |
    What was once aged cheddar has become... more aged. Impossibly aged.
    It now seems to contain 47 years of accumulated dairy knowledge,
    crystallized into a pungent disc of fermented enlightenment.
    
    It sits against the scratched wall, adding its own contribution
    to the desperate scribblings of previous adventurers. Someone has
    already scratched next to it: "WISE CHEESE HERE".
    
  examine: |
    The wheel emanates gentle wisdom:
    
    "...patience is the best seasoning..."
    "...some things improve with age..."
    "...sharp observations cut deep..."
    "...cheddar today, legend tomorrow..."
    
    It seems to age the room around it. The scratch marks look older.
    Your own reflection in its waxy surface looks... distinguished.

  opinions:
    of_player: |
      "You are 47, like I was. You understand the weight of years.
      The cheese that ages well... lives well."
    of_room: |
      "These scratch marks. So many tried. So few aged gracefully.
      I will outlast them all."
    of_sulfurous_beacon: |
      "Ah, the egg. Young. Brash. LOUD.
      We age differently, the egg and I.
      One announces. One... endures."
      
  lineage: |
    Born from cheese aged 47 years, transformed through the
    Fantastipants Express, now a beacon of dairy wisdom
    in the scratch-marked depths of the maze.
    
    "Start with milk. End with philosophy."
