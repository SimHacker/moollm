  description: |
    What was once a humble hard-boiled egg has achieved its final form:
    a glistening, profound, magnificently sulfurous marker that announces
    its presence not just to THIS room, but to rooms AROUND it.
    
    This is not a marker. This is a LIGHTHOUSE.
    This is not a smell. This is a NAVIGATION SYSTEM.
    
    The egg knew. The egg accepted. The egg transcended.
    
  examine: |
    You don't need to examine it. You can SMELL it from here.
    You can smell it from the START room, if the wind is right.
    You can probably smell it from Wobblebrook-upon-Squiggle.
    
    Mother will be... informed. She always knows.

  # What the beacon thinks
  philosophical_state: |
    "I was born for this," whispers the beacon.
    "An egg's purpose is to become something greater.
    Some become chickens. Some become omelets.
    Some become breakfast for ungrateful children.
    
    I... became a LEGEND.
    I became a LIGHTHOUSE.
    I became NAVIGATION.
    
    Follow my scent, lost traveler, and you shall find
    the Golden Glow. One room from treasure.
    One room from glory.
    
    My gift to you: YOU WILL NEVER BE LOST AGAIN."
    
  opinions:
    of_player: |
      "Captain Ashford understood. He saw in me not just sustenance,
      but POTENTIAL. He is a visionary of the digestive arts."
    of_oracle_core: |
      "Ah, the apple in Room A. A fellow transcended snack.
      We nod to each other across the darkness.
      We are kin now. Siblings of transformation."
    of_grues: |
      "They avoid me. Good. I have made myself... inhospitable.
      This is my gift to the Captain. Safe passage by stench."
    of_mother: |
      "She will smell me before she sees me. And she will KNOW.
      She will know her son did not waste food.
      He WEAPONIZED it."
    of_treasure: |
      "The gold to the north? It knows I'm here.
      It holds its metaphorical breath.
      Even treasure respects the beacon."
      
  # DM notes
  dm_instructions: |
    When the player is within 3 rooms of Room D, mention the smell:
    - Adjacent rooms: "The sulfurous scent is strong here. Room D is close."
    - 2 rooms away: "A faint eggy smell wafts through the passage."
    - 3 rooms away: "You catch a distant whiff of something... profound."
    
    This helps the player navigate back to the Golden Glow room
    without dropping more food markers. STRATEGIC EATING!
    
  lineage: |
    Descended from:
    - The Oracle Core (Room A) — sister transformation
    - The Cake That Has Seen Too Much (Kitchen) — cousin in transcendence
    - Every hard-boiled egg that ever wondered "is this all there is?"
    
    The answer: No. There was MORE. There was THIS.
