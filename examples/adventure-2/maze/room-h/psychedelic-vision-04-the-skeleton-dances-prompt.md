## The Vision

The skeleton RISES — not as undead horror, but as pure JOY.
They are dancing, bones clicking in rhythm with the mushroom pulse.

"YOU DID IT! YOU ACTUALLY DID IT!"
"Forty years I waited! FORTY YEARS!"
"And you brought me a GRUE HEAD! Like a cat brings a mouse!"
"I love you! I love your mother! I love your CHEESE!"
"Look! I can dance now! I couldn't dance before!"
"Being dead is actually pretty great once you're AVENGED!"
"Tell Unit #47 I got the letter! TELL THEM!"
"I'm going to dance FOREVER!"
"Want to see my moves? Of COURSE you do!"

The skeleton does the Macarena. Then the Electric Slide.
Then something that might be the Charleston, if bones could Charleston.

The Memorial Pie bubbles in time with the music.

## Prompt

A joyful skeleton dancing in a kaleidoscope of color. They wear the ghostly
echo of explorer's clothes — tattered but celebratory. Around them, fractals
of gold coins spin and scatter, no longer a trap but a celebration.

The background shifts through scenes: the skeleton alive, young, entering the
maze for the first time. The skeleton finding the gold. The skeleton's lamp
flickering. The darkness. And then — light! Joy! Freedom!

Día de los Muertos flowers bloom from the skeleton's eye sockets. 
A disco ball made of Memorial Pie reflects everywhere.
The Thing That Watches applauds with tendrils.

**Style:** Día de los Muertos celebration meets psychedelic disco, 
impossibly joyful despite the subject matter.

**Mood:** "Death is not the end. Vengeance is just the beginning of the party."
