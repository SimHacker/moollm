  # DESCRIPTION
  # ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  
  description: |
    The severed head of a grue — the first ever claimed by an adventurer
    through direct combat. It rests now at the skeleton's feet in Room I,
    proof that the vow of vengeance has been fulfilled.
    
    In death, it has achieved a fixed form: a mass of darkness compressed
    into something almost solid, studded with too many teeth and eyes that
    have gone dark forever.
    
    It is surprisingly light, as if made of condensed shadow.
    
  examine: |
    You look at the grue's head. Its many eyes are closed now, dark
    windows into nothing. The teeth — rows upon rows of them — remain
    sharp, a reminder of what this creature did for forty years.
    
    It smells faintly of blue cheese. Your weapon left its mark.
    
    This was the thing that killed the skeleton. That waited in the
    dark. That thought it was the apex predator of this maze.
    
    It was wrong.

  # PHYSICAL PROPERTIES
  # ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  
  properties:
    weight: "Surprisingly light (condensed shadow)"
    size: "Cantaloupe-sized, roughly spherical"
    texture: "Like touching cold smoke that refuses to dissipate"
    color: "Absolute black with darker patches"
    eyes: "27 (all closed, dark)"
    teeth: "Approximately 340 (still sharp)"
    smell: "Faint blue cheese (from the Gorgonzola Glaive)"
    
  visual_details:
    shape: |
      Not quite round — more like a sphere that couldn't decide
      on its geometry. Bumps and protrusions suggest features that
      were never meant to be seen by light.
      
    eyes_arrangement: |
      Scattered across the surface without pattern. Some clustered,
      some alone. Each about the size of a marble, perfectly black,
      now with a slight film of death over them.
      
    teeth_arrangement: |
      Multiple rows, like a shark's nightmare. Some curved inward
      for tearing. Some serrated for sawing. All designed for one
      purpose: consuming adventurers.
      
    surface_texture: |
      Matte black, absorbing light rather than reflecting it.
      Where the Gorgonzola Glaive cut, there's a pale edge —
      the only part of the grue that ever caught light.

  # THE KILLING BLOW
  # ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  
  death_details:
    killed_by: "Captain Ashford (Bumblewick Fantastipants)"
    weapon_used: "The Gorgonzola Glaive (weaponized blue cheese)"
    method: "Decapitation via single swing"
    location: "maze/room-f/ (The Cold Spot)"
    time: "Move 53, Adventure 2"
    
    critical_factors:
      - "Blue lamp light caused grue hesitation"
      - "Klingon battle opera caused psychological confusion"
      - "Weaponized cheese smell overwhelmed grue senses"
      - "Cold-enhanced cheese edge could cut grue-flesh"
      - "Perfect timing on lamp reignition"
      
    the_moment: |
      The grue was inches away, ready to feed. Captain Ashford
      reignited the blue lamp. The grue FROZE — never having
      encountered blue light before. In that single moment of
      hesitation, the Gorgonzola Glaive swung in a perfect arc
      and severed the head from the body.
      
      The body dissolved. The head remained.
      
      It was over in less than three seconds.
      
  # ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  # HISTORY OF THIS GRUE
  # ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  
  grue_history:
    age: "Unknown (possibly centuries)"
    kills: "Approximately 147 adventurers (estimated)"
    most_recent_victim: "The skeleton in Room I (40 years ago)"
    
    hunting_territory: |
      Primarily Room F (The Cold Spot), though it roamed the
      entire maze. The Cold Spot was its lair — the supernatural
      chill was its doing, weakening adventurers and their lamps.
      
    method: |
      Wait in darkness. Let the lamp oil run low. Approach
      when the light flickers. Consume when it dies.
      Patient. Efficient. Inevitable.
      
      Until now.

  # CURRENT LOCATION

  current_location: "maze/room-i/ — At the skeleton's feet"
  
  placement_significance: |
    The grue's head rests at the feet of its last victim.
    The skeleton waited forty years for this moment.
    The vow of vengeance has been fulfilled.
    
  skeleton_reaction: |
    The skeleton's eternal grin has softened. The pointing finger,
    forever aimed west toward the vendor, seems more relaxed now.
    They can finally rest.
    
  machine_reaction: |
    Two rooms away, ACME Unit #47's display shows:
    "GRUE SIGNAL... TERMINATED."
    Followed by: "THANK YOU, CAPTAIN."
    
  # ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  # LEGACY
  # ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  
  legacy: |
    This is the first grue head ever claimed by an adventurer.
    
    Others have survived grues — by running, by maintaining their
    lamps, by avoiding the darkness. But no one has ever FOUGHT
    one. No one has ever WON.
    
    Until Captain Ashford. With blue fire and blue cheese.
    
    Songs will be sung about this. The Klingon battle opera
    already exists. More will follow.
    
    The grues of this maze will learn: the darkness is no longer
    safe. The prey has teeth. The prey has CHEESE.
