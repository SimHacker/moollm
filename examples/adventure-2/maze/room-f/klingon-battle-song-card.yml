    If Captain Ashford survives this battle, "The Song of Cheese
    and Glory" will become a legendary composition — sung by warriors
    facing impossible odds, by adventurers wielding improvised weapons,
    by anyone who chooses to face their fears with opera and dairy.
    
    If Captain Ashford does NOT survive... well, the grue will have
    the most musically sophisticated dinner of its life.
    
    Either way: the song WILL be remembered.
    
    Today is a good day to... fight a grue with cheese.
    
    QAPLA'!
