## Prompt

A scene of ABSOLUTE DARKNESS. Almost entirely black frame.

In the darkness, barely visible: the suggestion of a human silhouette — Captain Ashford — standing with something raised (the Gorgonzola Glaive, faintly glowing blue from its mold). The Nomi cape is a whisper of movement in the void.

At the edge of perception: SOMETHING ELSE. A mass of darker black. Hints of teeth catching nonexistent light. Eyes that might be there, or might be imagination.

The air itself seems thick with dread. With anticipation. With the moment BEFORE.

**Style:** Horror film still. Desaturated to near-monochrome. High grain. The only "color" is the faint blue glow of the weaponized cheese mold.

**Mood:** "The last moment of being prey. The last moment before becoming the HUNTER."
