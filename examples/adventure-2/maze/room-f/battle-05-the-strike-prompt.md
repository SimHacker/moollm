## Prompt

EXTREME CLOSE-UP of the exact moment of contact.

**THE FRAME:**
The entire image is focused on approximately 4 inches of reality: where the Gorgonzola Glaive's edge is ENTERING the grue's neck.

**THE CHEESE EDGE:**
- Razor-sharp, pale gold from the coin-sharpening
- Blue mold veins glowing INTENSELY at the point of contact
- Smell waves visibly compressing against the grue-flesh
- The texture of aged cheese visible up close

**THE GRUE-FLESH:**
- Darkness being PARTED by the blade
- Like cutting through smoke that doesn't want to be cut
- Void-ichor beginning to spray — not blood, but condensed shadow
- The first wound this creature has EVER received

**THE SPRAY:**
- Void-ichor = liquid darkness
- Spraying outward from the cut
- Droplets catching the blue light
- Beautiful and horrifying

**BACKGROUND (extreme soft focus):**
- Captain Ashford's hand gripping the cheese weapon
- The suggestion of the grue's many eyes, now showing PAIN
- Blue lamp light creating halos around the spray

**Style:** Macro photography of violence. Uncomfortably close. Every detail visible. The moment of truth captured in excruciating detail.

**Mood:** "This is what it looks like when the impossible happens."

## Artifact Details (for coherence)

### The Gorgonzola Glaive Edge
- Color: Pale gold/white where sharpened
- Texture: Still recognizably cheese, but SHARP
- Mold: Blue veins most intense at cutting edge
- Sharpened on: The skeleton's gold coins
- Can cut: "Shadows" — and grue-flesh

### Grue-Flesh
- Texture: Like smoke made reluctantly solid
- Color: Absolute black, absorbing light
- Reaction to cut: PARTING, SPRAYING
- Never been wounded before this moment

### Void-Ichor
- The grue's "blood"
- Liquid darkness, not truly liquid
- Catches light in strange ways
- Sprays outward from wound
- Smells of: ancient darkness, fear made physical
