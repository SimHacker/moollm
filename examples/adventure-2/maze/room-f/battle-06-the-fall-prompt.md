## Prompt

TIME SLOWED DOWN. The grue's severed head tumbles through the blue-lit air.

**THE HEAD:**
- Rotating slowly, tumbling end over end
- 27 eyes frozen in the expression of their last moment
- ~340 teeth visible, some still glistening with void-ichor
- Shape: roughly cantaloupe-sized, not quite spherical
- Color: absolute black, darker patches where features cluster

**THE TRAIL:**
- Void-ichor streams behind the head like ink in water
- Ribbons of darkness that refuse to dissipate
- Creating beautiful, horrifying patterns in the air
- The trail connects the head to where it was severed

**THE DESTINATION:**
- Below the head: the pile of gold coins
- 100 coins, the skeleton's legacy
- Glinting in the blue light
- About to receive their trophy

**BACKGROUND:**
- The headless grue-body, beginning to dissolve
- Captain Ashford frozen mid-follow-through
- Blue lamp light creating god-rays through the void-ichor mist
- The walls of the Cold Spot, frost crystals catching light

**Style:** High-speed photography showing a slowed moment. Poetic, almost beautiful despite the violence. The fall is graceful, inevitable, final.

**Mood:** "This is what endings look like when you slow them down enough to appreciate them."

### The Void-Ichor Trail

- Creates ribbons and streams in the air
- Beautiful in a terrible way
- Will not stain — simply evaporates
- Smells of: ancient hunger, now ended

### The Gold Pile
- 100 coins exactly
- The skeleton's bait, their fatal mistake
