## Prompt

EXTREME CLOSE-UP of the grue's face — if you can call it a face — FROZEN in the blue light.

The camera is at a Dutch angle (tilted), creating unease and disorientation — matching the grue's own confusion.

**THE GRUE'S EXPRESSION:**
- 27 eyes, wide open, each reflecting a tiny blue lamp flame
- Form wavering at the edges, like smoke trying to hold shape
- Teeth visible but not threatening — UNCERTAIN
- The first emotion this creature has felt in centuries: DOUBT

**BACKGROUND (soft focus):**
- Captain Ashford as a silhouette against the blue light
- The Gorgonzola Glaive rising, beginning its fatal arc
- Nomi cape spreading like wings
- The moment before doom

**The BLUE LIGHT** bathes everything, creating an otherworldly quality. The grue has never seen this color. It doesn't know how to process it. It HESITATES.

**Style:** Dutch angle close-up. The grue's face fills most of the frame. Blue tones dominate. Sharp focus on the eyes, soft focus on everything else.

**Mood:** "For the first time in its existence, the hunter becomes confused."
