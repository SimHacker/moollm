## Prompt

The EXACT MOMENT of ignition. Blue fire EXPLODING outward from a brass lamp held in a warrior's grip.

The light rays cut through absolute darkness like swords, revealing:

**CAPTAIN ASHFORD** — Eyes fierce, teeth bared in a Klingon war cry, Nomi cape frozen mid-billow. One hand on the lamp, one hand raising the Gorgonzola Glaive (glowing with blue mold, smell waves visible in the new light).

**THE GRUE** — Caught mid-approach, FREEZING. A mass of darkness given form: too many teeth, too many eyes (27 of them), claws extended, form beginning to waver as the blue light touches it. Expression: pure SHOCK.

Gold coins on the floor catch the blue light, creating starbursts.

The supernatural cold is visible as frost crystals suspended in the air, now illuminated.

**Style:** High-contrast action photography. The blue light is INTENSE, almost nuclear. Deep shadows remain where the light hasn't reached. Dynamic, explosive energy.

**Mood:** "THIS is the moment everything changes."
