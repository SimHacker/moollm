    [ARCHIVED — The grue that lived here was SLAIN by Captain Ashford
    on Move 53, using the Gorgonzola Glaive (weaponized blue cheese).
    
    This is the first time in recorded history that an adventurer
    has killed a grue through direct combat.]

    You are in what was once the Cold Spot — the grue's lair.
    
    The supernatural cold is GONE. It died with the grue.
    The room is now normal cave temperature. Almost... warm?
    
    What remains:
    - Void-ichor stains where the grue's body dissolved
    - The Alchemical Residue (shimmering, whispering scientific marker)
    - 11 Klingon Victory Hors D'oeuvres (on a flat rock altar)
    - Scattered grue bone fragments
    - The overwhelming SMELL
    
    The gold pile is GONE — claimed by Captain Ashford.
    
  description_post_battle: |
    This is the Victory Kitchen now. The site of the first grue
    slaying. A place of legend, of cheese, of conquest.
    
    The smell is... transcendent. Three layers:
    1. Sharp blue cheese (from the Gorgonzola Glaive)
    2. Rotting grue flesh (the unharvested remains)
    3. The absence of gold (a hollow, unfulfilled scent)
    
    Future adventurers will know: something LEGENDARY happened here.
  
  # THE SMELL
  
  smell:
    intensity: "OVERWHELMING"
    radius: "Detectable throughout the maze"
    
    components:
      blue_cheese:
        source: "The Gorgonzola Glaive (used for slaying and cooking)"
        intensity: "Aggressive, sharp, weaponized"
        notes: "The cheese that killed a grue, then cooked it"
        
      grue_flesh:
        source: "Unharvested remains of the slain grue"
        intensity: "Rotting, ancient, dark"
        notes: "Darkness made olfactory"
        
      absence_of_gold:
        source: "The empty spot where 100 coins used to be"
        intensity: "Subtle but distinct"
        notes: "Like potential unfulfilled, dreams deferred"
        
    effect_on_visitors: |
      Anyone entering this room will NEVER forget the smell.
      It is the smell of victory. Of conquest. Of cheese-based violence.
      
    effect_on_maze: |
      The smell permeates outward:
      - Room I: Strong (skeleton doesn't mind)
      - Room J: Moderate (machine sensors overwhelmed)
      - Room E/G: Faint (markers recognize kinship)
      - Start: Whisper (something has changed)

  ambience: |
    The room has been transformed. What was once a place of death
    and cold is now a place of VICTORY and pungent, assertive smells.
    
    The Alchemical Residue whispers formulas.
    The hors d'oeuvres wait on their altar.
    The void-ichor stains tell the story.
    
    This is sacred ground now. The Victory Kitchen.
    
  legacy: |
    Future adventurers who find this room will discover:
    - A shimmering scientific marker
    - Remnants of a legendary feast
    - Void-ichor stains
    - An UNFORGETTABLE smell
    - And the knowledge that the darkness is not invincible
    
    The grue is dead. Long live the cheese.
