  description: |
    What was once a humble wedge of blue cheese is now a
    terrifying instrument of olfactory warfare.
    
    The cold of Room F intensified the fermentation to
    supernatural levels. The mold veins pulse with an eerie
    blue light. The edge, sharpened on the skeleton's gold
    coins, can cut through shadow itself.
    
    The smell is... transcendent. Aggressive. WEAPONIZED.
    
    This is what happens when a Belter captain decides to
    fight a grue with dairy products.
    
  examine: |
    You hold the Gorgonzola Glaive before you. It glows faintly
    blue — not from the lamp, but from the mold itself. The
    cold has awakened something in the cheese. Something ancient.
    Something ANGRY.
    
    The smell radiates outward in visible waves, distorting
    the air like heat shimmer. Your eyes water. Your nose
    protests. Your brain suggests that maybe this wasn't the
    best idea.
    
    But your heart knows: this is EXACTLY the right idea.
    
  properties:
    sharpness: "Razor-edged (can cut shadows)"
    smell_intensity: "WEAPONIZED (visible smell waves)"
    smell_radius: "10 feet"
    mold_status: "AWAKENED"
    cold_enhanced: true
    glow: "Faint blue (mold bioluminescence)"
    weight: "Light but POTENT"

  # COMBAT EFFECTS
  # ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  
  combat:
    attack_bonus: "+2 vs. grues (smell confusion)"
    
    effects_on_grue:
      confusion: |
        Grues hunt by smell as much as by absence of light.
        The Gorgonzola Glaive's weaponized stench OVERWHELMS
        their senses, causing momentary disorientation.
        
      damage: |
        The cold-enhanced edge can actually CUT grue-flesh.
        Normal weapons pass through grues like smoke.
        This cheese? This cheese is DIFFERENT.
        
      psychological: |
        Grues have eaten thousands of adventurers.
        None of them ever attacked with CHEESE.
        The grue will not know how to process this.
        
    combo_with_blue_lamp: |
      Blue lamp light → grue HESITATES (1 free turn)
      + Gorgonzola Glaive → grue CONFUSED (advantage)
      = Optimal strike window
      
      The skeleton didn't have cheese.
      The skeleton didn't have blue flame.
      YOU HAVE BOTH.

  smell:
    base_notes: "Sharp, fermented, assertive"
    cold_enhanced_notes: "Crystalline, piercing, AGGRESSIVE"
    weaponized_notes: "Reality-warping, nostril-conquering, TRIUMPHANT"
    
    effect_on_player: |
      Your eyes water. Your nose has filed a formal complaint.
      But you feel POWERFUL. The cheese has chosen you.
      
    effect_on_grue: |
      CONFUSION. Grues know the smell of fear, of death, of
      darkness. They do NOT know the smell of weaponized
      blue cheese aged in supernatural cold.
      
      For the first time in its existence, the grue
      does not know what it's dealing with.
      
    effect_on_skeleton: |
      One room away, the skeleton's eternal grin seems to
      WIDEN. Even in death, they can smell it. They APPROVE.
      
    effect_on_machine: |
      Two rooms away, ACME Unit #47's sensors detect the
      smell wave. It displays: "WHAT IS THAT??"
      Followed by: "...GO GET 'EM, CAPTAIN."

  wielder_notes: |
    "I am about to fight a grue... with CHEESE.
    
    Mother packed this cheese. She put it in the fridge for me.
    She said 'don't waste the food.'
    
    This is NOT waste. This is EVOLUTION.
    
    The cheese was always meant for this. From the moment the
    mold first grew, through the aging, the wrapping, the journey
    to the fridge, the journey to my lunchbox, and now HERE...
    
    The cheese has found its PURPOSE.
    
    And so have I.
    
    I have blue fire. I have blue cheese.
    
    THE GRUE HAS NOTHING BLUE.
    
    LET'S. DO. THIS."

  legacy: |
    If Captain Ashford survives this, the Gorgonzola Glaive
    will become legendary. Songs will be sung. Cheeses will
    be sharpened in tribute. Grues will learn to fear dairy.
    
    If Captain Ashford does NOT survive... well, at least
    it was the most creative death in maze history.
    
    Either way: WORTH IT.
