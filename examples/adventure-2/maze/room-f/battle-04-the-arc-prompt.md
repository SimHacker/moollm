## Prompt

DYNAMIC ACTION SHOT capturing the Gorgonzola Glaive mid-swing.

**CAPTAIN ASHFORD:**
- Full extension, weight committed to the strike
- Face contorted in Klingon battle fury: "QA-PLA'!"
- Eyes locked on target (the grue's neck)
- Body twisted, all momentum behind the swing

**THE GORGONZOLA GLAIVE:**
- Motion blur trailing behind the cheese edge
- Blue mold veins BLAZING with light
- VISIBLE SMELL WAVES emanating in the arc's wake
- The sharpened gold-coin edge catching the blue lamplight
- A streak of deadly dairy across the frame

**THE NOMI CAPE:**
- Billowing dramatically behind and around Ashford
- Space-black fabric with star chart lining briefly visible
- Creating a heroic silhouette
- Movement lines suggesting incredible speed

**BACKGROUND:**
- The frozen grue, blurred, about to receive the strike
- Blue lamp light creating dramatic shadows
- Gold coins scattering from the movement
- Frozen air particles catching the light

**Style:** High-speed action photography with intentional motion blur. The cheese weapon and its arc are the focal point. Everything else shows the SPEED and POWER of the strike.

**Mood:** "This is what vengeance looks like in motion."
