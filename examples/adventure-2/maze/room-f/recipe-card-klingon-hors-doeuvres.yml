  # TASTING NOTES
  
  tasting_notes:
    grue_meat: |
      Cold and dense, like eating condensed shadow. The flavor
      is subtle — almost absent — like the taste of hunger that
      has finally been satisfied. Surprisingly not unpleasant.
      
    blue_cheese: |
      The cheese IMPROVES with grue-slaying. Notes of victory,
      vengeance, and forty years of darkness made right. Sharp,
      assertive, alive with flavor.
      
    void_ichor: |
      Adds an unexpected umami depth that can only be described
      as "the taste of endings." Deep, complex, final. Use
      sparingly — it's powerful.
      
    overall: |
      The combination is greater than its parts. The absence of
      the grue meat creates a canvas for the assertive cheese.
      The void-ichor ties it together with darkness made edible.

  # CHEF'S NOTES
  
  chef_notes:
    from: "Captain Ashford (Bumblewick Fantastipants)"
    
    notes:
      - "The cheese MUST be the same one used to slay the grue. This is non-negotiable. It adds essential poetry to the dish."
      - "Harvest the meat quickly — grue bodies dissolve within minutes of decapitation."
      - "The bone shards make excellent conversation pieces afterward."
      - "Do NOT serve to vegetarians, pacifists, or anyone who asks 'what's in this?'"
      - "Best enjoyed while still wearing battle-stained clothing."
      
    personal_rating: "Would absolutely eat grue again. 10/10."
