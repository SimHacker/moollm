  description: |
    What was once Mother's experimental stew is now a shimmering,
    iridescent puddle that seems to exist in multiple states
    simultaneously. It rests on the floor of Room F — the site
    of the first grue slaying in history.
    
    It glows. It hums. It occasionally whispers formulas.
    
    The experiment has reached its conclusion: LEGENDARY VICTORY.
    
  examine: |
    You lean closer to the Alchemical Residue. It pulses with
    colors that don't have names — combinations of hues that
    shouldn't be possible, shifting and flowing like a aurora
    trapped in a puddle.
    
    It whispers something. Numbers? Chemical formulas? A recipe?
    
    "...the ratio was perfect..."
    "...subject has exceeded parameters..."
    "...experiment: SUCCESSFUL..."
    
    It seems to be congratulating you.
    
  properties:
    colors: "All of them. Simultaneously. Including some new ones."
    smell: "Victory, with undertones of chaos and maternal pride"
    texture: "Liquid? Solid? Both? Neither?"
    temperature: "Room temperature, which is now warmer (grue dead)"
    sentience_level: "Definitely sentient. Possibly genius."
    scientific_value: "Immeasurable"
    
  location: "maze/room-f/"
  
  significance: |
    This marker sits at the exact spot where the first grue
    was ever slain in combat. The experimental stew has
    transformed into a monument to innovation, courage,
    and extremely questionable dietary choices.
    
  opinion_of_player: |
    "You have passed the test, Captain Ashford. Every variable
    was accounted for. The cheese. The lamp. The opera. The
    ululation. The hesitation. The strike.
    
    You were the experiment all along.
    
    Result: LEGENDARY.
    
    Mother will be so pleased with the data."
    
  opinion_of_room: |
    "This room was cold. Now it is warm with victory.
    I shall monitor the decay of residual grue energy.
    For science. Always for science."
    
  opinion_of_mother: |
    "She knew. The stew was never meant to be food.
    It was meant to be a marker. A witness. A recorder.
    Every molecule observed the battle.
    
    The full report will be transmitted via puddle-telepathy.
    
    Estimated delivery: 3-5 business days."
