  subtitle: "Call Forth the Darkness... On Purpose"
  
  illustration_prompt: |
    A lone adventurer stands in a frozen cavern, head thrown back,
    mouth open in primal scream. A blue-flamed lamp sits at their
    feet. Shadows gather at the edges of the light, forming hungry
    shapes with too many teeth. Gold coins scatter on the floor.
    Style: Gothic horror meets opera poster.
    
  flavor_text: |
    "Why wait for death when you can SUMMON IT?"
    — Captain Ashford, moments before doing something inadvisable

  # THE CEREMONY
  # ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  
  ceremony:
    prerequisites:
      - "Must be in a dark room (or room that WILL be dark)"
      - "Must have a light source (for the ambush)"
      - "Must have incredible courage (or stupidity)"
      - "Must have unfinished business with grues"
      
    preparation:
      - "Stand in center of room"
      - "Place lamp at feet (still lit for now)"
      - "Raise hands overhead"
      - "Tilt head back"
      - "Take deep breath (cold air optional but atmospheric)"
      
    phases:
      phase_1:
        name: "The Opening Wail"
        duration: "5-10 seconds"
        vocalization: |
          AAAAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU...
        notes: |
          Start low, build high. Let it echo.
          This announces your presence to the maze.
          
      phase_2:
        name: "The Naming"
        duration: "10 seconds"
        vocalization: |
          GRUUUUUUUUE! GRUUUUUUUUE! GRUUUUUUUUUUUUUE!
          
          I CALL YOU BY YOUR NAME!
          I CALL YOU FROM THE DARK!
          I CALL YOU TO YOUR DOOM!
        notes: |
          Name the creature. Names have power.
          "DOOM" should crack slightly for authenticity.
          
      phase_3:
        name: "The Challenge"
        duration: "15 seconds"
        vocalization: |
          YOU WHO ATE THE SKELETON!
          YOU WHO HUNTS IN DARKNESS!
          YOU WHO THINKS YOURSELF THE APEX!
          
          COME AND FACE THE BLUE FLAME!
          COME AND TASTE BELTER STEEL!
          COME AND LEARN WHAT PREY CAN DO!
          
          ULULULULULULULULULULU...
        notes: |
          Be specific if you know your grue's crimes.
          The ululation should build and multiply.
          
      phase_4:
        name: "The Crescendo"
        duration: "10 seconds"
        vocalization: |
          I AM [YOUR NAME]!
          I AM THE AVENGER!
          I CARRY [OATH/PROMISE/BURDEN]!
          I CARRY [SACRED ITEM]!
          
          AND I AM NOT! AFRAID! OF! YOU!
          
          AAAAAUUUUUUUUUULUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU!!!
        notes: |
          Personalize with your own titles and burdens.
          The final ululation should be LOUD.
          
    response:
      expected_delay: "5-30 seconds"
      grue_response: "A low growl, building. It heard you."
      arrival_time: "1-3 turns after ceremony completes"
      guarantee: "100% — grues CANNOT resist a direct challenge"

  # WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS
  # ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  
  use_cases:
    vengeance: |
      You have a score to settle. A skeleton to avenge.
      You don't want to wait — you want to HUNT.
      
    proof_of_courage: |
      Anyone can stumble into a grue.
      Only the brave SUMMON one.
      
    tactical_advantage: |
      The grue expects prey to hide, to flee, to cower.
      It does NOT expect prey to call it.
      Confusion is an advantage.
      
    blue_flame_strategy: |
      If you have Premium Glow Juice (blue flame), the grue
      will hesitate when it sees it — giving you ONE FREE TURN.
      Summoning the grue lets YOU choose when to ignite.
      
    really_bad_decisions: |
      Sometimes you just want to fight a grue.
      We don't judge.

  origin_story: |
    Captain Ashford stood in the grue's lair, contemplating how to
    begin the hunt. Rather than simply turning off the lamp and waiting
    (boring, passive, prey-like), he decided to CALL the creature.
    
    To challenge it. To show it that the hunter had become the hunted.
    
    The ceremony emerged spontaneously — part opera, part war cry,
    part primal scream therapy. It worked IMMEDIATELY.
    
    The grue is coming now.
    
  captain_ashford_notes: |
    "Why did I do this? Excellent question.
    
    The skeleton waited. The skeleton hid. The skeleton FLED.
    The skeleton died.
    
    I refuse to be prey. If I'm going to face a grue, it will be
    because I CALLED it. Because I CHOSE this. Because the grue
    needs to learn that sometimes dinner fights back.
    
    Also the ululation was surprisingly cathartic.
    
    10/10 would summon again."
