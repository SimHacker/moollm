  salutation: "Dearest Mother,"
  
  opening: |
    I hope this letter finds you well and that the smell doesn't
    arrive before the words. I have done something LEGENDARY and
    I need you to know every detail.
    
    Do you remember the blue cheese you packed in my lunchbox?
    The one with the mold? The one you said was "supposed to be
    there, allegedly"?
    
    MOTHER, I KILLED A GRUE WITH THAT CHEESE.
    
  the_skeleton: |
    Deep in the maze, I found a skeleton. Someone who died forty
    years ago, one room away from a lamp oil vendor. They were
    pointing west — still trying to warn others, even in death.
    
    A vending machine had been waiting for them. It never forgot
    its friend who came every Thursday. It watched them die from
    one room away.
    
    I swore a VOW OF VENGEANCE. I promised to hunt the grue that
    killed them and bring its head back as a trophy.
    
  the_preparation: |
    I had advantages the skeleton never had:
    
    1. My lamp burns BLUE (Premium Glow Juice — grues hesitate!)
    2. I had the Grue Summoning Ululation Ceremony (I invented it)
    3. I had a Klingon Battle Opera (I composed it, in the style
       of Ash Blue Gutierrez — you'd love it)
    4. And I had YOUR BLUE CHEESE
    
    Mother, I sharpened that cheese on the skeleton's gold coins.
    I turned it into a WEAPON. The Gorgonzola Glaive, I called it.
    
    The mold AWAKENED. The smell became WEAPONIZED. The edge
    could cut through shadow itself.
    
  the_battle: |
    I stood in the grue's lair — the Cold Spot, where the skeleton
    died. I sang my Klingon opera. I performed my ululation.
    
    Then I turned off my lamp. I waited in total darkness.
    
    The grue came. It breathed on my neck. It whispered "prey."
    It remembered the skeleton. It was GLOATING.
    
    And then I IGNITED THE BLUE FLAME.
    
    Mother, the grue FROZE. It had never seen blue light before.
    In that single moment of hesitation, I swung the Gorgonzola
    Glaive in a perfect arc.
    
    Your cheese cut off that grue's head.
    
    The body dissolved. The head remained. PROOF.
    
  the_trophy: |
    I brought the grue's head back to the skeleton. I placed it
    at their feet. I said: "This is what killed you. This is the
    darkness that haunted this maze for forty years. It will
    never hurt anyone again."
    
    The skeleton's eternal grin finally looked PEACEFUL.
    
    The vending machine two rooms away displayed: "THANK YOU."
    
    The vow is fulfilled. Vengeance is complete.
    
  the_feast: |
    And then, Mother, I did something that would make you either
    proud or horrified (probably both):
    
    I COOKED THE GRUE.
    
    Using your blue cheese (the murder weapon) and the grue's own
    flesh and bones, I created: KLINGON VICTORY HORS D'OEUVRES.
    
    I have enclosed the recipe card. Please try it at home if you
    ever manage to slay a grue yourself. The key is using the same
    cheese that killed the creature — it adds a certain... poetry.
    
    I have also enclosed ONE SAMPLE hors d'oeuvre, vacuum sealed.
    Do NOT open it on a full stomach. The smell is... assertive.
    
    The taste? Surprisingly good. The grue meat is like eating
    "absence made flavorful." The cheese cuts through perfectly.
    5 out of 5 bat'leths.
    
  the_gold: |
    Oh! I almost forgot! The skeleton had 100 gold coins scattered
    on the floor of the grue's lair. I claimed them all.
    
    WE'RE RICH, MOTHER! 108 GOLD TOTAL!
    
    The dishes can wait three more weeks. I'm bringing home FORTUNE.
    
  promise_update: |
    Let me update you on my promises:
    
    ✅ Find treasure for Mother — DONE! (Jeweled Chalice, +10 points)
    ✅ Create and mail fabulous clothing — DONE! (Your Nomi Cape!)
    ⏳ Bring gold pieces home — IN PROGRESS! (108 coins!!!)
    ⏳ Not waste the food — TECHNICALLY COMPLIANT (transformation!)
    ⏳ Not be eaten by a grue — EXCEEDED EXPECTATIONS (I ATE THE GRUE)
    ⏳ Take care of the lamp — 979 oil remaining, burns BLUE!
    ⏳ Return home safely — WORKING ON IT
    ⏳ Do the dishes — STILL THREE WEEKS (sorry)
    
  closing: |
    I love you, Mother. Thank you for packing the cheese.
    
    It saved my life. It ended the grue's.
    
    And it made for EXCELLENT hors d'oeuvres.

    With all my love, victory, and aggressive dairy,
    
    Your son,
