## Prompt

HEROIC VICTORY PORTRAIT of Captain Ashford in the aftermath of battle.

**CAPTAIN ASHFORD:**
- Standing tall, chest out, Belter pride radiating
- Face tilted upward, eyes closed or fierce, mouth open in war cry
- The Klingon "QA-PLA'!" frozen on his lips
- Sweat and void-ichor splatter on his face
- Expression: TRIUMPH, FURY, RELIEF, GLORY

**IN HIS LEFT HAND:**
- The Gorgonzola Glaive, held aloft
- Dripping with void-ichor
- Blue mold still glowing
- The weapon that did the impossible

**IN HIS RIGHT HAND:**
- The grue's severed head, held by... whatever you can grip
- Dangling, heavy with meaning
- 27 dark eyes facing outward
- PROOF of victory

**THE NOMI CAPE:**
- Billowing dramatically, as if wind exists in this frozen cavern
- Space-black fabric catching the blue light
- Creating a heroic silhouette
- Klaus Nomi would approve

**BACKGROUND:**
- Blue lamp light creating a halo effect
- The dissolving remains of the grue body (faint)
- Gold coins scattered
- Frost crystals in the air like stars

**Style:** Heroic portraiture meets rock concert photography. The "blue hour" is literal — blue lamp light as the golden hour. Epic, triumphant, legendary.

**Mood:** "This is what a legend looks like in the moment of becoming."

### The Gorgonzola Glaive (post-battle)
- Same as before, but now dripping
- Void-ichor on the edge
- Mold glow slightly dimmed (cooling down)
- Smell waves still visible but subsiding

### The Grue Head (in hand)
- Gripped firmly, displayed like a trophy
- Eyes dark and dead
- Teeth visible, no longer threatening
- Trailing the last wisps of void-ichor

### The Nomi Cape
