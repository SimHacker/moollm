  description: |
    What remains of the Suspiciously Perfect Apple after Captain Ashford
    took one bite and experienced a Snow White-style prophetic coma.
    
    The core has crystallized into something resembling a tiny 
    apple-shaped crystal ball. Seeds visible inside pulse with
    faint golden light — the same color as the glow from Room D.
    
    It knows things. It's being coy about sharing.
    
  appearance: |
    - Apple core shape, but crystalline
    - Faint golden glow (matches Room D's glow)
    - Seeds visible inside, each a tiny light
    - Wet from the puddle, but the glow persists
    - More beautiful than it has any right to be
    
  whispers:
    # The Oracle Core occasionally whispers hints
    - "...west... golden glow... freedom..."
    - "...the skeleton tried the cold path..."
    - "...oil drains twice as fast in the cold..."
    - "...the vendor waits... always waits..."
    - "...we knew you'd eat us..."
    - "...suspiciously perfect for a reason..."
    
  properties:
    prophetic: true
    glowing: true
    marker_effectiveness: "EXCEPTIONAL — visible from room entrance"
    fairy_tale_artifact: true
    
  vision_granted: |
    The one who ate this apple saw the maze from above:
    - Room D (west) has the golden glow — exit to END
    - Room F has 100 gold coins
    - Room J has the lamp vendor
    - Room I has a skeleton with an empty lamp
    - The cold room (F) drains lamp oil twice as fast
    
  interactions:
    - action: EXAMINE
      response: |
        The Oracle Core pulses. "...you already know..." it whispers.
        "...west... gold... choices..."
        
    - action: LISTEN
      response: |
        You lean close. The core whispers maze secrets.
        Roll for additional hints.
        
    - action: TAKE
      response: |
        "...you could carry us... we would show you more..."
        But then the room would be unmarked. Trade-offs.
        
    - action: TALK
      response: |
        "...we were grown for this... suspiciously perfect..."
        "...every bite was planned..."
        "...even the coma..."
        The core seems smug.
        
  legacy: |
    This was once a simple apple. Suspiciously perfect, yes, but simple.
    Then a Belter pirate captain ate it and had a vision quest.
    Now it's an oracle. In a puddle. In a maze.
    
    The grues are impressed. They've seen a lot of things.
    They've never seen someone turn breakfast into prophecy.
