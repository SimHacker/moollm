  # The lyrics themselves
  lyrics: |
    Oh, I've GOT me a LAMP and it's terribly BRIGHT,
    It'll keep me from grues in the DARK of the NIGHT!
    It's made out of BRASS and it weighs quite a LOT,
    But it's all that I've GOT so I'll use what I've GOT!
    
    La la la, lamp lamp lamp,
    La la la, lamp lamp lamp!
    Without you I'm LUNCH for the creatures of DAMP,
    So I'm JOLLY well keeping you, BEAUTIFUL LAMP!
    
    The fuel may run LOW and the darkness may CREEP,
    And the grues will be WAITING for me when I SLEEP,
    But as long as you're BURNING I'll strut like a CHAMP,
    'Cause I've GOT me a LAMP! GOT me a LAMP!

  notes: |
    Composed spontaneously upon acquiring the brass lamp in the 
    Chamber of Commencement. The acoustics were surprisingly good.
    Mother would probably say it needs more verses about proper
    lamp maintenance, but Mother isn't here, is she?
