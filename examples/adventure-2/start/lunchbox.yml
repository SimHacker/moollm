  description: |
    A battered tin lunchbox, the kind spacers carry on long hauls.
    The lid is decorated with a faded sticker that says "BELTER BITES"
    and someone (Maurice?) has tied a burgundy ribbon around the handle.
    
    Inside, it's surprisingly spacious and thermally insulated.
    Perfect for carrying food through grue-infested mazes.
    
    A note taped inside the lid reads:
    "FOR DROPPING IN THE MAZE, NOT FOR EATING — Love, Mother"

  mothers_rule: |
    The food is for DROPPING IN THE MAZE to mark your path,
    NOT FOR EATING.
    
    Each dropped food item becomes a landmark, helping you
    navigate the twisty passages. The grues won't eat it
    (they're picky — they prefer adventurers).
    
  capacity_note: |
    The lunchbox can hold 20 items. The fridge has 20 items.
    This is not a coincidence. Mother planned ahead.

    - Bread crumbs (Hansel & Gretel — didn't work)
    - White pebbles (Hansel & Gretel — worked better)
    - Spray paint (Colossal Cave veterans)
    - Adventurer's rations (every dungeon crawler ever)
