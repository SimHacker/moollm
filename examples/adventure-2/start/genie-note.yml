  description: |
    A tiny note that materialized from the lamp when you rubbed it
    with particular vigor. The handwriting is somehow both ancient
    and bureaucratic.

    The genie you are trying to reach is currently on holiday.
    Your call is important to us. Please try again in approximately
    3,000 years. Current wait time: THREE THOUSAND YEARS.
    
    In the meantime, the lamp still works as a lamp. Which is
    actually quite useful, all things considered.

    P.S. The vigor was appreciated. Most people barely try.

  trivia: |
    The AGANS system was implemented approximately 4,500 years ago
    after too many adventurers complained about unattended lamps.
    The genie union negotiated holiday provisions in the Treaty of
    Brass Vessels (2513 BCE).
