# NAMING.yml — MOVED TO kernel/naming/
#
# This file has evolved from single file to directory (demonstrating the pattern!)
#
# Core: kernel/naming/NAMING.yml
# Sub-files: kernel/naming/NAMING-*.yml
#
# Directory structure (big-endian naming):
#   kernel/naming/
#   ├── NAMING.yml                 # Core principles (this redirects there)
#   ├── NAMING-COMPILATION.yml     # Headed vs headless targets
#   ├── NAMING-CONSTELLATIONS.yml  # Skill groups, inter-skill protocols
#   ├── NAMING-K-LINES.yml         # Virtual parents, dimensional grids
#   ├── NAMING-PATH-VARIABLES.yml  # $SKILLS, $ADVENTURE, etc.
#   └── NAMING-RELATIONSHIPS.yml   # Annotated see-also, tiered resolution

# The directory follows the evolution pattern this file documents:
#   Stage 1: kernel/NAMING.yml (single file)
#   Stage 3: kernel/naming/NAMING.yml (directory emergence)
#   Stage 4: kernel/naming/NAMING-*.yml (sub-object prefixing)

# For quick reference, the core principles:

core_principles:
  big_endian: "Most significant component first"
  prefix_ownership: "Prefix implies belonging"
  same_name_identity: "File named like directory IS the directory"
  directories_as_interests: "ls output IS the semantic index"
  virtual_parent: "Prefixes create implicit parent groups"
