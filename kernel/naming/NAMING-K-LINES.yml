# NAMING-KLINES.yml
# Names as semantic activation patterns — virtual parents, dimensional grids
#
# PAGE IN WHEN: Understanding how naming creates implicit structure,
#               virtual parent activation (no-ai → no-ai-*), coordinate naming
# PARENT: kernel/naming/NAMING.yml

core_insight: |
  Big-endian naming applies not just to FILES and DIRECTORIES,
  but to IDEAS and ACTIVATIONS themselves.
  
  Names create implicit organizational structures.
  The structure is in the naming convention, not in any index file.
  The LLM navigates this semantic space by pattern matching.

# VIRTUAL PARENT K-LINES
# Prefixes define parents that may or may not exist as entities

virtual_parent_klines:
  
  concept: |
    A prefix defines a VIRTUAL PARENT that may or may not exist as an entity.
    
    "no-ai" is understood as the parent of:
      - no-ai-slop
      - no-ai-gloss
      - no-ai-hedging
      - no-ai-sycophancy
      - no-ai-moralizing
      
    There is NO "no-ai" skill. But invoking "no-ai" activates them ALL.
    The prefix IS the parent. The hierarchy is implicit in the naming.
    
  activation: |
    Invoke: "NO-AI"
    
    The LLM understands this activates all no-ai-* skills.
    No dispatch table needed. No explicit registration.
    The naming convention creates the group.
    
  examples:
    - prefix: "no-ai-*"
      virtual_parent: "no-ai"
      meaning: "Activate all AI hygiene skills"
      
    - prefix: "good-ai-*"
      virtual_parent: "good-ai"
      meaning: "Activate all positive AI behavior skills"
      
    - prefix: "bead-*"
      virtual_parent: "bead"
      meaning: "All bead orchestration patterns"
      
    - prefix: "cat-*, dog-*, kitten-*, puppy-*"
      virtual_parent: "animal"
      meaning: "All animal character types"

# SUFFIX GROUPING
# The mirror of prefix grouping

suffix_grouping:
  
  concept: |
    Suffixes ALSO create groups — the mirror of prefix grouping.
    
    "*-slop" could activate everything slop-related:
      - no-ai-slop
      - code-slop (hypothetical)
      - doc-slop (hypothetical)
      
    The SUFFIX is the shared property. The PREFIX is the domain.
    
  examples:
    - suffix: "*-gloss"
      meaning: "All things about glossing/covering up"
      
    - suffix: "*-chat"
      meaning: "All chat/dialogue files"
      
    - suffix: "*-review"
      meaning: "All review documents"
      
    - suffix: "*.yml"
      meaning: "All YAML files — even file extensions are suffixes!"

# PREFIX AND SUFFIX TOGETHER

prefix_and_suffix:
  
  concept: |
    Prefix AND suffix together define an INTERSECTION.
    
    "no-ai-*-slop" doesn't exist, but if it did:
      "no-ai-" (domain) + "-slop" (category)
      
    More powerful: COORDINATE NAMING creates grids.
    
  coordinate_naming: |
    Room naming: room-x-y or room-x-y-z
    
    room-0-0     room-1-0     room-2-0
    room-0-1     room-1-1     room-2-1
    room-0-2     room-1-2     room-2-2
    
    The NAME encodes POSITION. The filesystem is a 2D grid.
    No separate map file needed — the naming IS the map.

# LINEAR INTERSECTIONS (1D STRIPS)

linear_intersections:
  
  concept: |
    Iteration numbers create 1D STRIPS through naming space.
    
    RUN-000-*.yml, RUN-001-*.yml, RUN-002-*.yml
    
    The "-000-", "-001-", "-002-" is a LINEAR SEQUENCE.
    Sort by name = sort by iteration.
    
  patterns:
    iteration: "RUN-{NNN}-description.yml"
    version: "v1-*, v2-*, v3-*"
    session: "2026-01-24-*, 2026-01-25-*"
    
  example: |
    A sequence through naming space:
    
    → RUN-000-init.yml
    → RUN-001-first-attempt.yml  
    → RUN-002-refined.yml
    → RUN-003-breakthrough.yml
    
    This is a 1D strip: linear progression through iterations.

# DIMENSIONAL GRIDS (2D, 3D, n-D)

dimensional_grids:
  
  concept: |
    Naming can encode 2D, 3D, or n-D coordinates.
    Not just files — IDEAS can be organized this way.
    
  2d_grid: |
    room-x-y naming:
    
    room-0-0  room-1-0  room-2-0
    room-0-1  room-1-1  room-2-1
    room-0-2  room-1-2  room-2-2
    
    X increases east, Y increases south.
    The naming convention IS the spatial layout.
    
  3d_cube: |
    room-x-y-z naming:
    
    room-0-0-0 (ground floor, northwest)
    room-0-0-1 (second floor, northwest)
    room-1-2-0 (ground floor, east-south)
    
    The third coordinate is vertical.
    Naming defines the 3D structure.
    
  conceptual_grids: |
    Apply to ideas, not just rooms:
    
    skill-domain-aspect:
      skill-ai-hygiene
      skill-ai-creativity
      skill-human-hygiene
      skill-human-creativity
      
    This is a 2D grid: domain × aspect
    Navigation is implicit in the naming.

# NAMING PATTERNS SUMMARY

naming_patterns_summary:
  
  prefix: "Groups by WHAT IT IS (no-ai-*, bead-*, cat-*)"
  suffix: "Groups by WHAT IT DOES (*-slop, *-chat, *-review)"
  coordinate: "Encodes POSITION (room-x-y, RUN-NNN-*)"
  intersection: "Combines patterns (prefix + suffix + coordinate)"
  
  key_insight: |
    Names define IMPLICIT STRUCTURES.
    The LLM navigates by PATTERN MATCHING.
    No explicit index or dispatch table needed.
    THE NAMING CONVENTION IS THE ORGANIZATION.
