# NAMING-RELATIONSHIPS.yml
# Two-way K-line relationships, annotated see-also, tiered resolution
#
# PAGE IN WHEN: Writing see-also sections, understanding skill relationships,
#               documenting complex inter-skill dependencies
# PARENT: kernel/naming/NAMING.yml

concept: |
  K-lines connect ideas. When two things reference each other,
  that's a TWO-WAY COMMUNICATION CHANNEL.
  
  But relationships have DIRECTION and CONSTRAINTS.
  Comment each side of the link to document this.

# ANNOTATED RELATIONSHIPS

annotated_relationships:
  
  principle: |
    LONG COMMENTS ON SEE-ALSO ITEMS SHOULD BE COMMON AND NUANCED.
    
    The comment isn't decoration — it's semantic metadata that
    MODULATES how the linked item will be understood in THIS scope.
    
    This is powerful: you're not just linking, you're DECLARING
    A COMPLEX RELATIONSHIP and specifying how it applies here.
  
  examples:
    - link: "no-ai-slop → yaml-jazz"
      forward: "no-ai-slop uses yaml-jazz format"
      backward: "yaml-jazz references no-ai-slop as example"
      symmetric: false
      
    - link: "pub ↔ coatroom"
      forward: "Exit from pub leads to coatroom"
      backward: "Exit from coatroom leads to pub"
      symmetric: true
      
    - link: "bead → postal"
      forward: "Beads flow through postal system"
      backward: "Postal system carries beads (and other messages)"
      constraint: "One-way delivery — no return receipt by default"
      
  comment_syntax: |
    see-also:
      - skills/bead        # Reference only — yaml-jazz does not require beads
      - skills/postel      # Core dependency — robustness principle
      - kernel/postal      # One-way — yaml-jazz can be sent via postal
      
    The comment documents the relationship type:
      "Reference only" = soft link
      "Core dependency" = hard link
      "One-way" = directional constraint

# RICH ANNOTATION EXAMPLE

rich_annotation_example: |
  see-also:
    - skills/bead        
      # Beads are a prominent YAML Jazz example
      # but this skill does NOT depend on beads
      # yaml-jazz is the paradigm, beads are one instantiation
      # 
      # WHY THIS MATTERS:
      # Without this annotation, an LLM might think:
      #   "yaml-jazz requires beads" (WRONG)
      #   "I must load bead skill to use yaml-jazz" (WRONG)
      #   "yaml-jazz is about beads" (WRONG — beads are ONE example)
      #
      # With this annotation, the LLM understands:
      #   "beads demonstrate yaml-jazz, but don't define it"
      #   "yaml-jazz applies to MANY file types"
      #   "soft reference, not hard dependency"

# TIERED RESOLUTION
# Don't bloat the CARD — use appropriate level of detail

tiered_resolution:
  
  principle: "DON'T BLOAT THE CARD. Use tiers of detail."
  
  tiers:
    
    tier_1_card:
      location: "CARD.yml advertisements"
      detail: "Brief, activation-focused"
      question: "Why would I want to respond to this ad?"
      format: "One-line hints, not essays"
      example: |
        advertisements:
          SEMANTIC-YAML:
            score: 90
            condition: "Need YAML that LLMs understand deeply"
            
    tier_2_skill:
      location: "SKILL.md see-also"
      detail: "Important relationships with short comments"
      question: "What's the relationship?"
      format: "Enough context to understand the link"
      example: |
        see-also:
          - skills/bead  # Example, not dependency
          - skills/postel  # Core — robustness applies
          
    tier_3_readme:
      location: "README.md K-Lines table"
      detail: "Full explanation in markdown table"
      question: "Full picture?"
      format: "Rich, formatted, linkable with why column"
      example: |
        | K-Line | Relationship | Why |
        |--------|--------------|-----|
        | [bead](../bead/) | Example | Beads demonstrate YAML Jazz |
        | [postel](../postel/) | Core | Robustness principle applies |
        
  resolution_order: |
    Quick activation? → Read CARD advertisements
    Need context? → Read SKILL.md see-also
    Full picture? → Read README.md K-Lines table
    
  recommendation: |
    MATCH DETAIL TO TIER:
    
    CARD.yml: "Why activate?" (one line)
    SKILL.md: "What's the relationship?" (short comment)
    README.md: "Full explanation" (table with why column)
    
    Don't put README content in CARD.
    Don't leave README with bare links.
    
    The LLM reads at appropriate depth for the task.

# PNEUMATIC TUBE METAPHOR

pneumatic_tube_metaphor: |
  Two-way K-lines are like pneumatic tubes:
  
  skills/no-ai-slop ←————————→ skills/yaml-jazz
                     tube
                     
  But tubes can have RULES:
  
  "No food in this tube"
  "One-way — sender cannot receive reply"
  "Priority — urgent messages first"
  "Filtered — only beads, not raw messages"
  
  Comment the see-also to document the tube rules.
