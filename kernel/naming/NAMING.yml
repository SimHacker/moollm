# NAMING.yml — Core Naming & Organization Protocol
# Big-Endian File Naming as Object Binding
#
# This is the CORE file — kept lean for iteration-to-iteration operation.
# Detailed topics are factored into sub-files (page in when needed).
#
# Inspired by: Marvin Minsky's K-lines, LLOOOOMM conventions



# PHILOSOPHY

philosophy: |
  Names cluster related files. The filesystem IS the semantic network.
  Files "belong" to entities through naming prefixes.
  Chats and metadata are ABOUT objects, not INSIDE them.
  
  DIRECTORIES AS INTERESTS:
  When an LLM lists a directory, the filenames serve as VIRTUAL INTERESTS —
  semantic signals about what's available. Well-written filenames are
  LLM-recognizable K-lines. The `ls` output IS the index.
  
  Directories are expandable outlines. The LLM navigates structure.
  Good naming makes filenames themselves guide exploration.



# BIG-ENDIAN NAMING

big_endian:
  principle: "Most significant component first"
  why: "Alphabetical sort clusters related files"
  pattern: "{entity}-{component}-{variant}.{ext}"
  
  examples:
    good:
      - "alan-kay.yml"               # Entity
      - "alan-kay-soul.yml"          # Entity component
      - "2026-01-24-session.yml"     # Date first
      - "RUN-001-experiment.yml"     # Sequence first
    bad:
      - "soul-alan-kay.yml"          # Wrong order
      - "session-2026-01-24.yml"     # Date buried



# FILE EVOLUTION LIFECYCLE

evolution:
  stages:
    1: "thing.yml → single file"
    2: "thing.yml, thing.md, thing-notes.md → prefix clustering"
    3: "thing/ with thing.yml inside → directory emergence"
    4: "thing/thing-part1.yml → sub-object prefixing"
    5: "thing/parts/ → sub-directory grouping"
    
  golden_rule: "File with same name as directory IS the directory"



# OWNERSHIP

ownership:
  prefix_implies_belonging: "don-hopkins-wish-list.md → belongs to don-hopkins"
  directory_containment: "don-hopkins/wish-list.md → same, prefix dropped"
  implicit: "Files inside entity directory belong to entity"



# CANONICALIZATION

canonicalization:
  case: "lowercase with dashes"
  people: "first-last (alan-kay, don-hopkins)"
  things: "descriptive-name (plan-then-execute, yaml-jazz)"
  avoid: "CamelCase, underscores, redundant suffixes"



# PROTOCOL SYMBOLS

k_lines:
  BIG-ENDIAN: "Most significant component first"
  PREFIX-OWNERSHIP: "Prefix implies belonging"
  SAME-NAME-IDENTITY: "File named like directory IS the directory"
  ABOUT-NOT-INSIDE: "Conversations about objects don't live inside them"
  VIRTUAL-PARENT: "Prefixes create implicit parent groups (no-ai → no-ai-*)"



# SUB-FILES — Page In When Needed
# These factor out topics that can stand alone

sub_files:
  
  NAMING-PATH-VARIABLES.yml:
    content: "Symbolic path prefixes ($SKILLS, $ADVENTURE, etc.)"
    page_in_when: "Writing YAML with paths, adventure navigation, room references"
    
  NAMING-K-LINES.yml:
    content: "Virtual parents, suffix grouping, dimensional grids, coordinate naming"
    page_in_when: "Understanding implicit structure, no-ai → no-ai-* activation"
    
  NAMING-RELATIONSHIPS.yml:
    content: "Annotated see-also, tiered resolution, two-way K-line relationships"
    page_in_when: "Writing see-also sections, documenting skill dependencies"
    
  NAMING-CONSTELLATIONS.yml:
    content: "Skill groups that activate together, inter-skill protocols"
    page_in_when: "Understanding skill dependencies, optimizer behavior"
    
  NAMING-COMPILATION.yml:
    content: "Headed vs headless compilation targets"
    page_in_when: "Running cursor-mirror optimize, building for automation"



# ANTI-PATTERNS

avoid:
  - "Generic names inside directories (character/soul.yml → character/character.yml)"
  - "Type-first naming (chat-alan-kay.yml → alan-kay-chat.yml)"
  - "Chats trapped inside subjects (skills/foo/CHAT.yml)"
  - "Mixed case or underscores"



# DIRECTORIES AS INTERESTS

directories_as_interests:
  principle: "Directory listings ARE virtual interests for the LLM"
  
  insight: |
    ls examples/
    → 2026-01-24-mafia-tribute-relationship-management.yml
    → 2026-01-25-register-switch-without-accountability.yml
    
    The LLM instantly understands what violations have been caught.
    No separate index file needed. The directory IS the index.
    
  filenames_as_klines: |
    "2026-01-24-euphemism-laundering-mafia-tribute.yml"
    
    The LLM sees: date, concept, metaphor — before opening.
    This IS a K-line: the name activates related knowledge.
