# Structure and Interpretation of Community Programs

> **A tribute to SICP, teaching MOOLLM/YAML programming the way Abelson & Sussman taught Scheme.**

---

## Status: STUB

**TODO:** This is a placeholder for a future book/design document.

**Dream:** Ask Hal Abelson if he'd be interested in collaborating or advising.

## The Vision

SICP taught a generation how to think about computation through Scheme — not because Scheme was the point, but because it was a **minimal, elegant vehicle** for exploring ideas about abstraction, state, and interpretation.

MOOLLM could be that for a new generation — teaching how to think about **community, simulation, and emergent behavior** through YAML and markdown. Not because YAML is the point, but because it's a minimal, elegant vehicle for exploring ideas about:

- **Microworlds** as learning environments
- **Skills as programs** that compose and inherit
- **Characters as objects** with state, behavior, and relationships
- **Rooms as contexts** that shape what's possible
- **The LLM as eval()** — the interpreter that gives meaning to our programs

## Tentative Chapter Outline

### Part I: Building Abstractions with Skills

1. **The Elements of Skill Programming**
   - YAML as data, YAML as code
   - Comments as semantic content (YAML Jazz)
   - The Skill as the fundamental unit

2. **Skills and the Processes They Generate**
   - Methods as procedures
   - State as accumulation
   - Recursive skill activation

3. **Modularity, Objects, and State**
   - Characters as objects
   - Rooms as contexts
   - The three-tier persistence model

### Part II: Structure and Interpretation

4. **The Semantic Image Pyramid**
   - GLANCE.yml, CARD.yml, SKILL.md, README.md
   - Multi-resolution reading
   - Token economics and attention

5. **K-Lines and Activation**
   - Minsky's Society of Mind
   - Names as semantic activation vectors
   - Skill composition and inheritance

6. **The Cosmic Interpreter**
   - The LLM as eval()
   - Divine acting: omniscience simulating limited minds
   - Constitutional role-fidelity

### Part III: Modularity, Objects, and State

7. **Assignment and Local State**
   - The `.moollm/` scratch space
   - Session state vs persistent state
   - Append-only logs

8. **Streams and Simulation**
   - Speed of Light: many turns, one call
   - Game state as iteration files
   - The Cosmic Dealer pattern

### Part IV: Community and Emergence

9. **The Simulator Effect**
   - Minimal simulation + imagination = emergence
   - The Sims design philosophy
   - Object advertisements

10. **Adversarial Deliberation**
    - Many voices, one context
    - Constitutional disagreement
    - Ensemble inference

11. **Play-Learn-Lift**
    - The constructionist methodology
    - Jazz first, then standards
    - Skill archaeology and evolution

## Why This Matters

SICP wasn't about Scheme. It was about **how to think**.

This book wouldn't be about YAML. It would be about **how to think about communities of minds** — human, artificial, and hybrid — engaging in shared meaning-making.

The LLM is the new Lisp machine. MOOLLM is one way to program it.
