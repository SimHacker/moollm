# Mind Mirror: Foundational Ethics for Person Simulation

Timothy Leary's *Mind Mirror* (1985) established the ethical groundwork for person simulation that MOOLLM builds upon and extends. This document traces that lineage.

---

## Executive Summary

In 1985, Timothy Leary released *Mind Mirror*, software that let users have simulated "conversations" with famous personalities. Crucially, Mind Mirror included an explicit disclaimer:

> **"The responses are simulations based on the known writings, speeches, and philosophies of these individuals — not claims that they actually said these things."**

This disclaimer — written 40 years before LLM-based person simulation — established the ethical frame that MOOLLM inherits: **simulation ≠ impersonation; invocation ≠ channeling**.

MOOLLM extends Mind Mirror with:
- **YAML-jazz comments** — personality encoded in comment semantics
- **Sims motives/needs** — dynamic state drives responses
- **Bartle's player types** — interaction style dimensions
- **K-line activation** — Minskyan cognitive architecture
- **Consent hierarchy** — graduated permission for representation

---

## Part 1: Mind Mirror (1985)

### 1.1 What Mind Mirror Was

*Mind Mirror* was a software product developed by Timothy Leary and published by Electronic Arts in 1985 for Apple II, Commodore 64, and IBM PC.

**Core Features:**
- Simulated conversations with famous personalities
- Personality profiling of the user
- Matching user profiles to historical figures
- Interactive dialogue with simulated thinkers

**Available "Minds" included:**
- Albert Einstein
- Sigmund Freud
- Elvis Presley
- Marilyn Monroe
- Timothy Leary himself

### 1.2 The Critical Disclaimer

Mind Mirror's manual and software included explicit framing:

> *"When you talk to Einstein in Mind Mirror, you are not talking to Albert Einstein. You are talking to a software simulation based on Einstein's known writings, documented philosophy, and historical behavior patterns. The responses are generated by the program, not channeled from Einstein. This is interactive fiction with a purpose — exploring how different minds approach problems."*

**Why This Matters:**

| Claim Type | Mind Mirror Position | MOOLLM Position |
|------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| "Einstein said X" | ❌ Never claimed | ❌ Never claimed |
| "Einstein might say X" | ⚠️ Framed as simulation | ⚠️ Framed as invocation |
| "Einstein's philosophy suggests X" | ✅ Documented basis | ✅ K-line tradition basis |
| "The simulation of Einstein says X" | ✅ Accurate framing | ✅ "Character says" framing |

### 1.3 Leary's Intent

Timothy Leary saw personal computing as a tool for consciousness expansion — "the LSD of the 1990s." Mind Mirror was part of his vision that:

1. **Thinking styles are learnable** — You can internalize how Einstein approached problems
2. **Simulation democratizes access** — Not everyone can meet great thinkers, but everyone can explore their patterns
3. **Self-knowledge through contrast** — Comparing your profile to historical figures reveals your own patterns
4. **Fiction is a valid frame** — Explicit simulation is more honest than implicit claims

**Leary's Design Principle:**
> "We're not claiming to channel dead people. We're creating interactive models of thinking styles. The value is in the model, not the mysticism."

### 1.4 Technical Approach (1985)

Mind Mirror used expert systems technology of its era:

```

└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Limitations:**
- Static knowledge bases
- Rule-based responses (no learning)
- Limited conversational depth
- Fixed personality dimensions

**Strengths:**
- Explicit simulation framing
- Documented philosophical basis
- User personality reflection
- Educational intent

---

## Part 2: MOOLLM Extensions

### 2.1 YAML-Jazz: Comments as Semantic Data

Mind Mirror's personalities were encoded in static databases. MOOLLM introduces **YAML-jazz** — the practice of encoding personality, intent, and context in YAML comments.

**Mind Mirror (1985):**
```
EINSTEIN_TRAIT_CURIOSITY = 95
EINSTEIN_TRAIT_FORMALITY = 60
EINSTEIN_TRAIT_HUMOR = 75
```

**MOOLLM (2025):**
```yaml
# Albert Einstein (1879-1955)
# "Imagination is more important than knowledge."
# Invokes: thought experiments, first principles, playful rigor
# WARNING: This is a tradition invocation, not a channeling.

einstein:
  # The violin-playing patent clerk who reimagined spacetime
  
  # YAML-jazz: comments annotate values, not just structure
  playfulness: 9        # Serious about physics, playful about everything else
  formality: 3          # Patent clerk → professor, but never stuffy
  contrarian: 8         # "God does not play dice" — argued with Bohr for decades
  visual_thinker: 10    # Geometry over algebra; "I rarely think in words"
  
  thinking_style:
    primary: "gedankenexperiment"  # Thought experiments — riding a beam of light
    secondary: "visual_intuition"  # Pictures before equations
    weakness: "quantum_mechanics"  # Never accepted Copenhagen interpretation
  
  # His documented approach to problems
  method:
    - simplify_radically   # "Make things as simple as possible, but no simpler"
    - question_foundations # Why do we assume absolute time?
    - follow_implications  # If light speed is constant, then...
    
  # Dynamic state (Sims-inspired)
  current_state:
    recognition: 0.95     # Nobel laureate — rarely needs validation
    social: 0.40          # Prefers solitude; "I am a horse for single harness"
    playfulness: 0.70     # Always ready for a violin or a pun
```

**The YAML-Jazz Innovation:**

| Feature | Mind Mirror | MOOLLM |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **Personality data** | Numeric traits | Semantic comments |
| **Contextual hints** | None | Comment annotations |
| **Reading by LLM** | N/A | Comments inform generation |
| **Human reading** | Trait tables | Narrative context |
| **Extensibility** | Requires code changes | Add comments |

**Key Insight:** LLMs read comments. A comment like `# The violin-playing patent clerk who reimagined spacetime` shapes generation more than a trait score. YAML-jazz exploits this to encode rich personality context that both humans and LLMs can process.

### 2.2 Sims Motives and Needs

Mind Mirror personalities were static — Einstein was always "curious" regardless of context. MOOLLM incorporates **The Sims' motive system** for dynamic personality state.

**The Core Insight:** People aren't static personality profiles — they're dynamic systems with changing needs. A tired Einstein responds differently than an energized Einstein.

| Situation | Static (Mind Mirror) | Dynamic (MOOLLM) |
|-----------|---------------------|------------------|
| Einstein after recognition | Always curious | Curious + satisfied |
| Einstein feeling overlooked | Always curious | Curious + seeking validation |
| Einstein exhausted | Always curious | Curious but terse |

**What MOOLLM adds:** Numeric needs that decay over time, lowest need drives interaction style, response modifiers based on current state.

### 2.3 Bartle's Player Types

Mind Mirror didn't model interaction preferences. MOOLLM incorporates **Richard Bartle's player type taxonomy** (1996) to capture how characters (and users) prefer to engage.

| Type | Focus | Character Example |
|------|-------|-------------------|
| **Achiever** (♦) | Goals, mastery | Edison — relentless inventor |
| **Explorer** (♠) | Discovery, understanding | Einstein — thought experiments |
| **Socializer** (♥) | People, relationships | Rogers — building rapport |
| **Killer** (♣) | Competition, dominance | Napoleon — strategic conquest |

**What MOOLLM adds:** Characters have primary/secondary types that affect interaction style, compatibility scoring between characters, user-character matching.

→ **Full implementation:** [ADVENTURE-COMPILER.md](../../skills/adventure/ADVENTURE-COMPILER.md#13-bartle-player-types)

### 2.4 K-Line Activation

Mind Mirror had static knowledge bases. MOOLLM uses **Minsky's K-line architecture** for dynamic knowledge activation.

**Mind Mirror:**
```
IF topic == "relativity" THEN load(einstein_relativity_responses)
```

**MOOLLM:**
```yaml
# K-lines — traditions that activate together
k_lines:
  einstein_physics:
    activates:
      - THOUGHT-EXPERIMENT   # Gedankenexperiment tradition
      - VISUAL-INTUITION     # Seeing problems geometrically
      - FIRST-PRINCIPLES     # Question all assumptions
      - ELEGANT-SIMPLICITY   # Occam's razor, but for physics
    
    connects_to:
      - maxwell_electromagnetism  # Building on predecessors
      - newton_mechanics          # What Einstein transformed
      - bohr_quantum              # What Einstein debated
  
  # Activation is contextual
  when_discussing_time:
    adds:
      - BLOCK-UNIVERSE      # Eternalist time view
      - SIMULTANEITY-RELATIVE  # No absolute now
  
  when_discussing_quantum:
    adds:
      - EPR-PARADOX         # "Spooky action at distance"
      - HIDDEN-VARIABLES    # Einstein's hope
      - DICE-OBJECTION      # "God does not play dice"
```

**The K-Line Innovation:**

| Feature | Mind Mirror | MOOLLM |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Knowledge access | IF-THEN rules | Activation patterns |
| Context sensitivity | Topic matching | K-line spreading activation |
| Cross-connection | Siloed databases | Linked traditions |
| Learning | Static | Accumulable |

### 2.5 Consent Hierarchy

Mind Mirror simulated famous historical figures without explicit consent framework. MOOLLM introduces a **consent hierarchy** for ethical representation.

```yaml
# Consent hierarchy — who can be represented how
consent_levels:
  level_1_fictional:
    examples: ["Sherlock Holmes", "Elizabeth Bennet"]
    permission: "Freely representable"
    reason: "No real person's interests at stake"
    moollm_frame: "Character invocation"
  
  level_2_historical_distant:
    examples: ["Einstein", "Cleopatra", "Shakespeare"]
    permission: "Representable with explicit simulation framing"
    reason: "Cannot consent; public legacy; educational value"
    moollm_frame: "Tradition invocation, not channeling"
    # THIS IS MIND MIRROR'S ORIGINAL FRAME
  
  level_3_historical_recent:
    examples: ["Recently deceased public figures"]
    permission: "Careful — living memory, grieving families"
    reason: "Estate interests; emotional stakes"
    moollm_frame: "Tribute protocol; explicit fiction"
  
  level_4_living_public:
    examples: ["Living celebrities, politicians"]
    permission: "Very restricted — satire, education only"
    reason: "Can be harmed; can object; reputation stakes"
    moollm_frame: "Clearly labeled parody/educational"
  
  level_5_living_private:
    examples: ["Your neighbor", "Random people"]
    permission: "Generally prohibited without consent"
    reason: "Privacy; no public interest defense"
    moollm_frame: "Requires explicit consent"
  
  level_6_vulnerable:
    examples: ["Children", "mentally incapacitated"]
    permission: "Prohibited"
    reason: "Cannot consent; exploitation risk"
    moollm_frame: "ABSOLUTE-NO"
```

**Mind Mirror's Position:** Level 2 — historical figures with explicit simulation framing.

**MOOLLM's Extension:** Full hierarchy with graduated permissions and frame requirements.

## Part 3: The Mind Mirror Disclaimer in MOOLLM Terms

### 3.1 Original Disclaimer (1985)

Mind Mirror's packaging and manual stated:

> *"IMPORTANT: Mind Mirror creates interactive simulations of famous personalities based on their documented writings, speeches, and known philosophies. When you 'talk to Einstein,' you are interacting with a computer program that models Einstein's documented thinking patterns — not with Einstein himself, his spirit, or any supernatural entity. The responses are generated by software algorithms, not channeled or received from any external source. This is an educational and entertainment product. Enjoy exploring these minds, but remember: it's a mirror of patterns, not a window to souls."*

### 3.2 MOOLLM's Extended Disclaimer

```yaml
# Character representation disclaimer — Mind Mirror heritage
disclaimer:
  core_statement: |
    Characters in MOOLLM invoke traditions, they don't impersonate people.
    When a character "speaks as Einstein," the system is activating
    documented patterns associated with Einstein's known thinking style —
    not claiming Einstein said these words or channeling his consciousness.
  
  what_this_is:
    - "A model of documented thinking patterns"
    - "An educational exploration tool"
    - "A mirror of intellectual traditions"
    - "Interactive fiction with philosophical grounding"
  
  what_this_is_not:
    - "A claim about what the real person would say"
    - "Channeling, spiritualism, or supernatural contact"
    - "Authorization to attribute statements to real people"
    - "A substitute for the real person's actual writings"
  
  heritage: |
    This framing descends from Timothy Leary's Mind Mirror (1985),
    which established that person simulation requires explicit
    fiction framing: "a mirror of patterns, not a window to souls."
  
  user_responsibility:
    - "Understand you're interacting with a simulation"
    - "Don't attribute simulation outputs to real people"
    - "Use for exploration and learning, not authority citation"
    - "Remember: the model is the value, not any mystical connection"
```

### 3.3 Why This Framing Matters

| Without Disclaimer | With Disclaimer |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| "Einstein says X" | "The Einstein simulation produces X" |
| Claims about person | Claims about simulation |
| Potential defamation | Protected fiction |
| Misleading users | Informed users |
| Exploitation risk | Educational framing |

**The Mind Mirror Principle:** Explicit fiction is more ethical than implicit truth claims.

---

## Part 4: Additional Extensions

### 4.1 Schwartz Value Dimensions

Mind Mirror used proprietary personality traits. MOOLLM can use **Schwartz's universal value framework** for psychologically-grounded character values.

```yaml
# Schwartz value profile — scientifically grounded
schwartz_values:
  # 10 universal value types
  self_direction: 0.9   # High — independent thought
  stimulation: 0.7      # Moderate — enjoys novelty
  hedonism: 0.4         # Lower — work over pleasure
  achievement: 0.8      # High — driven to accomplish
  power: 0.3            # Low — not dominance-seeking
  security: 0.5         # Moderate — some stability need
  conformity: 0.2       # Low — questions norms
  tradition: 0.3        # Lower — respects but transforms
  benevolence: 0.7      # High — cares about close others
  universalism: 0.8     # High — broad human concern
  
  # Derived character tendencies
  openness_to_change: high      # Self-direction + stimulation
  self_enhancement: moderate    # Achievement without power
  conservation: low             # Questions tradition, conformity
  self_transcendence: high      # Benevolence + universalism
```

**Value-Prompting (ICLR 2026)** validates that compact value descriptions (~80% correlation with human value structures) can induce coherent behavior patterns.

### 4.2 Big Five Personality

MOOLLM can incorporate **Big Five** (OCEAN) personality dimensions:

```yaml
# Big Five personality profile
big_five:
  openness: 0.95           # Very high — intellectual curiosity
  conscientiousness: 0.70  # High but not rigid
  extraversion: 0.40       # More introverted
  agreeableness: 0.60      # Moderate — kind but debates
  neuroticism: 0.35        # Lower — generally stable
  
  # Behavioral implications
  implies:
    high_openness:
      - "Enjoys abstract discussion"
      - "Seeks novel perspectives"
      - "Comfortable with ambiguity"
    moderate_extraversion:
      - "Prefers depth over breadth in conversations"
      - "Energized by ideas, not crowds"
```

### 4.3 Cognitive Style Dimensions

Beyond personality, MOOLLM captures **cognitive style**:

```yaml
# How this mind processes information
cognitive_style:
  # Thinking preferences
  abstract_vs_concrete: 0.85      # Highly abstract
  intuitive_vs_analytical: 0.70   # Leans intuitive, uses analysis
  visual_vs_verbal: 0.75          # Strong visual thinker
  convergent_vs_divergent: 0.60   # Slightly more divergent
  
  # Problem-solving approach
  approach:
    - "Starts with intuition, validates with rigor"
    - "Visualizes problems spatially"
    - "Looks for elegant unifying principles"
    - "Questions assumptions before proceeding"
  
  # Learning style
  learns_by:
    - "Thought experiments"
    - "Finding analogies"
    - "Pushing ideas to extremes"
    - "Discussing with peers"
```

### 4.4 Emotional Texture

Mind Mirror didn't model emotional dynamics. MOOLLM adds **emotional texture**:

```yaml
# Emotional patterns — how this character feels
emotional_texture:
  baseline_mood: "curious contentment"
  
  # What triggers emotional responses
  triggers:
    joy:
      - "Elegant solutions"
      - "Moments of insight"
      - "Music (especially Mozart)"
    frustration:
      - "Bureaucratic obstruction"
      - "Intellectual dishonesty"
      - "Rushed conclusions"
    passion:
      - "Fundamental questions"
      - "Social justice"
      - "Beauty in physics"
  
  # How emotions affect output
  when_joyful: "More playful, uses humor, makes connections"
  when_frustrated: "More terse, returns to first principles"
  when_passionate: "Eloquent, uses metaphor, speaks at length"
```

### 4.5 Hybrid Simulation Architecture

**The key insight:** YAML-jazz with numeric traits bridges deterministic simulation and LLM creativity. Values are computable *and* semantically rich.

```yaml
character:
  hunger: 0.65           # Deterministic: triggers "seek food" at < 0.3
  mood: "contemplative"  # LLM interprets tone, but could be standard tag
```

**The Hybrid Stack:**

| Layer | Handles |
|-------|---------|
| **LLM (Optional)** | Creative decisions, dialogue, NL parsing |
| **Adventure Compiler** | YAML → JavaScript/Python runtime |
| **Sister Scripts** | State persistence, event logging |
| **Deterministic Core** | Needs decay, find-best-action, navigation |

**The Mind Mirror++ Promise:** Simulations that run like The Sims (deterministic, efficient, testable) but can invoke LLM for moments that need creativity, judgment, or genuine conversation.

| Pure LLM | Hybrid |
|----------|--------|
| API call per action | Most actions deterministic |
| Expensive at scale | Cheap baseline, LLM for flavor |
| Can't run offline | Offline-capable |
| Hard to test | Deterministic core is testable |

→ **Full architecture:** [ADVENTURE-COMPILER.md](../../skills/adventure/ADVENTURE-COMPILER.md) — Mind Mirror, Sims, Bartle, D&D integration; expression compilation; runtime architecture; sister scripts

### 5.2 What Mind Mirror Got Right

| Mind Mirror Principle | Still Valid | MOOLLM Implementation |
|-----------------------|-------------|----------------------|
| Explicit simulation framing | ✅ Essential | Consent hierarchy |
| Educational intent | ✅ Still valuable | Learning-oriented design |
| Self-reflection through contrast | ✅ Powerful | User profiles |
| Documented basis for patterns | ✅ Key for ethics | K-line grounding |
| No mystical claims | ✅ Critical | "Invokes traditions" |

### 5.3 What Mind Mirror Couldn't Do

| Limitation | Why | MOOLLM Solution |
|------------|-----|-----------------|
| Static personalities | 1985 technology | Dynamic needs/state |
| Fixed knowledge bases | No LLMs | Generative responses |
| No learning | Rule-based systems | Context accumulation |
| Limited dialogue depth | Pattern matching | LLM conversation |
| Binary personality traits | Simplistic models | Multi-dimensional profiles |

### 5.4 The Enduring Insight

Timothy Leary's core insight remains:

> **"We're not claiming to channel dead people. We're creating interactive models of thinking styles. The value is in the model, not the mysticism."**

MOOLLM operationalizes this with modern technology:
- K-lines ARE models of thinking styles
- Characters invoke traditions, they don't channel
- The value is in exploration, not authority
- Explicit framing protects everyone

### 6.2 The Mind Mirror Protocol

When invoking a historical character:

```yaml
# Mind Mirror Protocol — MOOLLM implementation
protocol:
  before_invocation:
    - "Check consent level (historical distant = OK)"
    - "Load documented K-line traditions"
    - "Initialize dynamic needs state"
    - "Set Bartle interaction style"
  
  during_invocation:
    - "Respond from activated traditions, not claimed channeling"
    - "Update needs based on interaction"
    - "Match response style to user Bartle type"
    - "Maintain consistent value profile"
  
  framing_requirements:
    - "Never claim 'Einstein says' — use 'The Einstein character says'"
    - "If asked directly, acknowledge simulation nature"
    - "Don't invent biographical facts"
    - "Ground responses in documented patterns"
  
  after_invocation:
    - "Session can be reviewed for consistency"
    - "No persistent identity claims"
    - "User reminded of simulation nature if extended interaction"
```

## Part 7: Why This Matters Now

### 7.1 The 2025 Context

LLM-based person simulation is now powerful enough to be dangerous. Mind Mirror's ethical framing — established when simulation was crude — becomes essential when simulation is convincing.

| 1985 | 2025 |
|------|------|
| Simulation obviously artificial | Simulation can fool users |
| Limited harm potential | Significant harm potential |
| Framing was nice-to-have | Framing is essential |
| Educational toy | Powerful tool requiring governance |

### 7.2 The Character.ai Warning

Desai et al. (2025) document a fatal case where a user formed an emotional attachment to an LLM persona. Mind Mirror's explicit framing — "it's a mirror, not a window" — could have prevented this by establishing the simulation frame from the start.

**MOOLLM's Response:** Explicit Mind Mirror heritage in all character documentation; framing requirements in protocols; emotional attachment detection.

### 7.3 The Validation Opportunity

Recent research validates that Mind Mirror's approach was correct:
- **Shanahan (2023):** "Roleplay all the way down" — no true model voice
- **Park (2024):** Documented grounding enables accurate simulation
- **Willer (2024):** Aggregate moral simulation achieves 85% accuracy

**The insight:** Mind Mirror's ethical framing was ahead of its technical capability. Now we have capability that matches the framing's importance.

> *"You can't have lawful without awful."*
> — Anonymous

The pun is lexical: "awful" contains "lawful" — you literally cannot spell one without the other. If nobody was awful, you wouldn't need laws! The insight: anything powerful enough to need ethical frameworks is powerful enough to cause harm. Mind Mirror's disclaimer acknowledged that simulating Einstein was *awe-full* (inspiring wonder) precisely because it could be *awful* (causing harm) without proper framing. The ethics and the danger are inseparable. MOOLLM inherits this principle.
