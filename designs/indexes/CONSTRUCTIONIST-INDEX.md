# Constructionist Education Index

For educators, Scratch/Snap! developers, and those continuing
Papert and Kay's vision of learning by building.

## Key Skills for Constructionist Education

| Skill | What It Does |
|-------|--------------|
| [skills/constructionism/](../../skills/constructionism/) | Learn by building principles |
| [skills/play-learn-lift/](../../skills/play-learn-lift/) | Explore → Notice → Share methodology |
| [skills/room/](../../skills/room/) | Directories as explorable spaces |
| [skills/adventure/](../../skills/adventure/) | Room-based learning adventures |
| [skills/micropolis/](../../skills/micropolis/) | SimCity as educational microworld |

## Micropolis: Open Source SimCity

Micropolis is SimCity open-sourced (GPL-3), now being developed as a
constructionist educational platform:

- **WebAssembly** — Runs in browser
- **SvelteKit** — Modern multiplayer frontend
- **AI Tutors** — MOOLLM characters as advisors
- **School-Owned Repos** — Each school runs their own instance
- **GitHub Integration** — Issues as assignments, PRs as submissions

See: [skills/micropolis/](../../skills/micropolis/)

## Snap!/Scratch Integration Vision

| Component | Integration |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Turtles** | Tornados, city agents |
| **Stages** | Cities, neighborhoods |
| **Scripts** | Zoning rules, policies |
| **Sensors** | City simulation data |
| **Agents** | Logo turtles with SimCity editing tools |

Programmable agents like Logo turtles, but with SimCity editing
tools in their mouth as well as pens!

## Logo Adventure: The Predecessor

In the 1980s, Don contributed "Logo Adventure" to the Terrapin Logo
examples disk — a text adventure where the Logo REPL was the parser.

```
? NORTH
You are in a dark forest.
? LOOK TREE
You see an owl.
? TAKE OWL
Owls cannot be taken.
```

This is exactly what MOOLLM does with the Cursor chat interface:
the chat is the adventure.

*Microworlds are the best way to learn about complex systems.
Build the city. Break the city. Understand the city.*
