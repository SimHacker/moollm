# Procedural Rhetoric Index

For game studies scholars, Bogost readers, and those interested
in how simulations make arguments.

---

## The Core Insight

Ian Bogost's "Persuasive Games" established that games can make
arguments through their rules and systems — **procedural rhetoric**.

MOOLLM extends this: what happens when the simulation contains
**multiple arguing agents**? The argument IS the game.

## GitHub as MMORPG: Social Dynamics as Rhetoric

| GitHub Feature | Game Mechanic | Rhetorical Function |
|----------------|---------------|---------------------|
| Issues | Quests, newspapers | Information distribution |
| Discussions | Town halls, debates | Public deliberation |
| PRs | Timeline merges | Consensus building |
| Branches | Parallel universes | Counterfactual exploration |
| Teams | Political factions | Group identity |
| Actions | NPCs that respond | Automated rhetoric |
| Blame | Provenance | Accountability |

The social dynamics of open-source development become the game's rhetoric.

## Debating Experts, Not Averaged Mush

Traditional single-voice LLM: statistical center of all viewpoints.
Hedged. Cautious. Anodyne. The centroid of the cloud.

MOOLLM: **ensembles of perspectives** who argue:

| Character | Rhetorical Position |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Maya | Skeptical critique |
| Frankie | Optimistic advocacy |
| Vic | Data-driven analysis |
| Tammy | Relational ethics |

You get the **range of opinion**, not the mean.
Stories that survive cross-examination are more robust.

## The Simulation Isn't Just Making AN Argument

It's making ARGUMENTS, plural, and watching them fight.

This is procedural rhetoric for the age of LLMs:
- The rules determine which arguments can be made
- The characters embody different positions
- The debate mechanics structure the discourse
- The audience (human or AI) evaluates outcomes

---

## Cow Clicker and Its Lesson

Bogost's "Cow Clicker" proved that people will play anything
if it has the right feedback loops — a satirical procedural argument
about exploitative game design that people played seriously.

MOOLLM makes a different procedural argument:
- Transparency beats opacity
- Many voices beat one voice
- Auditable systems beat black boxes
- The filesystem IS the world (you can see everything)

## LGBTQ+ Representation in The Sims

The Sims has been revolutionary for LGBTQ+ representation in games:

| Feature | Version | Impact |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Same-sex relationships | Sims 1 (2000) | First AAA game with same-sex romance |
| Same-sex marriage | Sims 2 (2004) | "Joined Union" ceremony |
| Gender-neutral create-a-sim | Sims 4 (2016) | Decouple clothing/body/preferences |
| Pronouns | Sims 4 (2022) | Customizable pronouns including they/them |
| Trans representation | Sims 4 | Full gender transition support |

**Why this matters for procedural rhetoric:**

The Sims makes an *implicit* procedural argument that LGBTQ+ relationships
are normal — not through cutscenes or dialogue, but through mechanics.
You can marry who you want. You can be who you are. The rules don't
discriminate.

This is rhetorical work done through *absence of discrimination* in
the simulation model. The argument is: what if the world worked like this?

MOOLLM inherits this philosophy. Characters have relationships, not
*prescribed* relationships. The simulation doesn't police identity.

**Queer Pioneers of Computing:**

LGBTQ+ people are foundational to computing itself:

| Pioneer | Contribution |
|---------|--------------|
| Alan Turing | Father of computing (prosecuted for being gay) |
| Lynn Conway | VLSI revolution (trans woman, fired by IBM 1968) |
| Sophie Wilson | ARM architecture (trans woman) |
| Christopher Strachey | Early computer art (gay) |
| **Dani Bunten Berry** | M.U.L.E., pioneering multiplayer games (trans woman) |

**The Sims was dedicated to Dani Bunten Berry** — a trans woman game designer
whose multiplayer games (M.U.L.E., The Seven Cities of Gold) influenced 
Will Wright's approach to social simulation. This dedication is part of
The Sims' deep LGBTQ+ heritage.

Lambda (λ) is sacred to both Lisp programmers AND LGBTQ+ communities.
Tom Doerr selected it for the Gay Activists Alliance in 1970.
Edinburgh made it official in 1974. Self-awareness across traditions.

## Code of Conduct

**STATUS: IN DEVELOPMENT — UNDER DISCUSSION**

MOOLLM is developing a comprehensive code of conduct covering:

1. **Human participants** — Real people contributing to MOOLLM repos
2. **Bot participants** — AI characters operating in GitHub-as-MMORPG
3. **Representation ethics** — How we simulate real people
4. **Character consent** — Who can be simulated, under what constraints
5. **Parody and satire** — When sockpuppets and commentary are acceptable

**Issues to resolve:**

- What constraints apply to bots that don't apply to humans?
- When can you simulate a real person without explicit consent?
- How do we handle posthumous representation? (see: Lynn Conway)
- What's the difference between parody and puppeteering?
- How do we identify and disclose AI-generated content?

**Track progress:**

See: [GitHub Issue: MOOLLM Code of Conduct](#) (TODO: create issue)

The code of conduct will be explicitly both eyes open stereo "WOKE" (WWOOKKEE) 
in the MOOLLM/LLOOOOMM tradition — not as a pejorative but as a declaration.
We know what we stand for. We say it out loud.

*The argument IS the game. The simulation isn't neutral. The rules are rhetoric.*
*And sometimes the most powerful rhetoric is making discrimination impossible.*
