# Procedural Rhetoric Index

For game studies scholars, Bogost readers, and those interested
in how simulations make arguments.

---

## The Core Insight

Ian Bogost's "Persuasive Games" established that games can make
arguments through their rules and systems — **procedural rhetoric**.

MOOLLM extends this: what happens when the simulation contains
**multiple arguing agents**? The argument IS the game.

## GitHub as MMORPG: Social Dynamics as Rhetoric

| GitHub Feature | Game Mechanic | Rhetorical Function |
|----------------|---------------|---------------------|
| Issues | Quests, newspapers | Information distribution |
| Discussions | Town halls, debates | Public deliberation |
| PRs | Timeline merges | Consensus building |
| Branches | Parallel universes | Counterfactual exploration |
| Teams | Political factions | Group identity |
| Actions | NPCs that respond | Automated rhetoric |
| Blame | Provenance | Accountability |

The social dynamics of open-source development become the game's rhetoric.

## Debating Experts, Not Averaged Mush

Traditional single-voice LLM: statistical center of all viewpoints.
Hedged. Cautious. Anodyne. The centroid of the cloud.

MOOLLM: **ensembles of perspectives** who argue:

| Character | Rhetorical Position |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Maya | Skeptical critique |
| Frankie | Optimistic advocacy |
| Vic | Data-driven analysis |
| Tammy | Relational ethics |

You get the **range of opinion**, not the mean.
Stories that survive cross-examination are more robust.

## The Simulation Isn't Just Making AN Argument

It's making ARGUMENTS, plural, and watching them fight.

This is procedural rhetoric for the age of LLMs:
- The rules determine which arguments can be made
- The characters embody different positions
- The debate mechanics structure the discourse
- The audience (human or AI) evaluates outcomes

## Cow Clicker and Its Lesson

Bogost's "Cow Clicker" proved that people will play anything
if it has the right feedback loops — a satirical procedural argument
about exploitative game design that people played seriously.

MOOLLM makes a different procedural argument:
- Transparency beats opacity
- Many voices beat one voice
- Auditable systems beat black boxes
- The filesystem IS the world (you can see everything)

*The argument IS the game. The simulation isn't neutral. The rules are rhetoric.*
