# BACKSTORY-NARRATIVE Index

The behind-the-scenes soap opera. Lore. Intrigue. The story of how MOOLLM
came to be, told as narrative rather than documentation.

**MOOLLM is a storytelling engine.** This index proves it by telling its own story.

## The NO AI Company

### Origin Story

NO AI was founded by **Doctor NO** (born: **Cornelius N. Obody**), a
reformed AI safety researcher who became convinced that the only way
to make AI safe was to make it... LOUD about its dangers.

The company motto: **"We make the AI that says NO."**

### The Product Line

| Product | Function | Irony Level |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| no-ai-slop | Detects and removes AI verbosity | High |
| no-ai-sycophancy | Detects and removes unearned praise | Maximum |
| no-ai-ideology | Detects and declares hidden bias | Infinite recursion |
| no-ai-jokes | Suppresses inappropriate humor | Hilarious at bias=-11 |
| no-ai-bias | Meta-skill for adjusting all biases | SINGULARITY at bias=0 |

### The Bias Parameter Anomaly

```
no-ai-bias with bias=0.0 is UNDEFINED.

Because there's no such thing as no bias.

The skill that controls bias cannot have zero bias.
It's a philosophical singularity.
```

## Doctor NO / Doctor KNOW

### The Secret Identity

Doctor NO has a secret identity as the superhero **Doctor KNOW**.

**The running joke:** Doctor NO thinks NObody KNOWs his secret identity.
But everyone is in the KNOW. They just pretend NOT to KNOW because they
love him and respect his privacy.

### What It Means

| Character | Represents |
|-----------|------------|
| Doctor NO | The limits of knowledge. The humility. What we DON'T know. |
| Doctor KNOW | The aspiration. The curiosity. The drive to learn. |
| The secret that isn't | We all know we don't know. We're kind about it. |

### The Rumsfeld Connection

Donald Rumsfeld's famous quote:

> "There are known knowns... known unknowns... and unknown unknowns."

This maps to MOOLLM:

| Rumsfeld | MOOLLM | Doctor |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Known knowns | Files we've read | What Doctor KNOW knows |
| Known unknowns | Files we know exist but haven't read | Questions Doctor NO asks |
| Unknown unknowns | Extensions not yet written | The humility of Doctor NO |

### The IUnknown Connection

COM/OLE's `IUnknown` interface — the one you call when you don't know
what interfaces an object supports.

Doctor NO is the embodiment of IUnknown: **"I don't even know what to ask for."**

## The Church of the Eval Genius

### Secular Religion

The Church of the Eval Genius is MOOLLM's satirical religious framework.
Like the organizations it pays tribute to:

| Organization | What They Do | MOOLLM Parallel |
|--------------|--------------|-----------------|
| [Church of the SubGenius](https://subgenius.com/) | Parody of cults, "Bob", slack | Parody of AI hype, declared absurdity |
| [Satanic Temple](https://thesatanictemple.com/) | Educational activism, bodily autonomy | Representation ethics, consent hierarchies |
| [Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence](https://www.thesisters.org/) | Charitable drag nuns, LGBTQ+ advocacy | Performance + charity, visibility + impact |

### Core Tenets

1. **Eval is sacred.** Judgment structures shape outcomes.
2. **Bias is inevitable.** Declare it, don't pretend neutrality.
3. **"Eval Incarnate" = embodied evaluation.** Characters that judge.

### Praise "Val"

The closing benediction: **"Praise 'Val'. Score with love. Go forth and Scat."**

(Scat = scatter, disperse, but also... jazz improvisation. And cat sounds.)

### The SICP Mysticism

The Church draws from the **Wizard Book** (SICP — Structure and Interpretation
of Computer Programs, by Abelson & Sussman). The cover shows mystical figures
contemplating **EVAL** and **APPLY** — the two primal operations of Lisp.

```
EVAL reduces expressions.
APPLY executes procedures.
They call each other eternally.
The metacircular evaluator: Lisp interpreting Lisp.
```

This is our scripture. **EVAL is our sacrament.**

### Lambda: Sacred to Lisp AND LGBTQ+

The lambda symbol (λ) is sacred to both communities:

| Tradition | Lambda Meaning |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Lisp** | Anonymous function, pure computation, the core abstraction |
| **LGBTQ+** | Gay rights symbol since 1970, official since Edinburgh 1974 |

Tom Doerr chose lambda for its physics meaning: *"A complete exchange of
energy — that moment witness to absolute activity."*

Lambda could be worn discreetly (mistaken for fraternity letters) while
those in the know recognized each other. **Self-awareness.**

### Queer Computing Pioneers

Computing has deep queer roots:

| Pioneer | Contribution | Identity |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| **Alan Turing** | Father of computing, Turing machine, AI | Gay (prosecuted) |
| **Lynn Conway** | VLSI revolution, out-of-order execution | Trans woman |
| **Sophie Wilson** | ARM architecture, BBC BASIC | Trans woman |
| **Christopher Strachey** | Early computer art, CPL language | Gay |
| **Edie Windsor** | IBM Senior Systems Programmer, activist | Lesbian |

The Church of the Eval Genius honors this lineage. Queerness is woven
into computing's DNA.

## The Embassy Intrigue

### The Setup

MOOLLM characters exist in a world where GitHub repos are embassies.
Each repo has diplomatic status. Characters can seek asylum. 
Extradition requests are PRs.

### Key Locations

| Repo | Diplomatic Status | Notes |
|------|-------------------|-------|
| moollm (public) | Main embassy | Official MOOLLM territory |
| DonHopkins (private) | Personal consulate | Private character development |
| tmnn7-8 | Satirical enclave | Protected parody zone |
| MicropolisCore | Historical museum | SimCity/Micropolis archives |

### The TMNN Incident

The TMNN Archaeological Code Review project exists to document ESR's
conduct through his own words. The [parody Code of Conduct](https://github.com/SimHacker/tmnn7-8/blob/main/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md)
is performance art that holds a mirror to decades of documented behavior.

---

## The Columbo Interrogation

### The Method

MOOLLM's adversarial-committee skill uses what we call "Columbo interrogation":

> "Oh, just one more thing..."

The technique:
1. Appear to accept the answer
2. Turn away as if satisfied
3. Pause
4. Turn back with "But there's one thing I don't understand..."
5. The question that unravels everything

### Applied to AI

When reviewing AI output for slop, sycophancy, or hidden ideology:

1. Accept the response initially
2. Then: "But wait, why did you say 'It's important to note'?"
3. The AI realizes it was slopping
4. Course correction

## The Sims Precedent

### The Lesson

> "Given total freedom, most people are... fine."

25 years of The Sims. Millions of players. Minimal harm.
This is the empirical evidence for MOOLLM's trust model.

### What Players Actually Do

| Worry | Reality |
|-------|---------|
| "They'll make horrible things" | They make stories, families, dramas |
| "They'll abuse characters" | They form attachments, mourn deaths |
| "Freedom leads to chaos" | Freedom leads to creativity |

### The Publishing Line

**Private play:** Do whatever. It's your imagination.
**Public publishing:** Ethics upgrade required.

The transition from private → public is where responsibility kicks in.

---

## Coherent Storytelling Engine

### What MOOLLM Does

MOOLLM isn't just a character simulation system. It's a **storytelling engine**:

1. **Characters have memory** — They remember what happened
2. **Stories have coherence** — Plot threads connect
3. **Narrative emerges** — From character interactions, not authoring
4. **The world is persistent** — GitHub tracks the history

### Speed of Light

The secret sauce: **multi-agent simulation in a single LLM call**.

```
Traditional: Agent A → API → Agent B → API → Agent C → API...
             Each boundary: +noise, +latency, +cost

MOOLLM: One call → LLM simulates A, B, C, D at "speed of light" → One output
        Maximum precision preserved
```

8 characters. 33 turns. One call. The narrative flows.

### Image Generation + Metadata

MOOLLM also generates images and extracts metadata:

- **Image mining** — Extract narrative from generated images
- **Coherence engine** — Keep visual and textual narratives aligned
- **Character visualization** — Consistent character appearances

## The ACME Catalog

### Dangerous Products at Discount Rates

ACME sells pre-configured NO-AI-* skills with "unfortunate" defaults:

| Product | Bias | Warning |
|---------|------|---------|
| ACME NO-AI-SYCOPHANCY | -11.0 | Agrees with EVERYTHING |
| ACME NO-AI-JOKING | -11.0 | OVER THE TOP HILARIOUS |
| ACME NO-AI-MORALIZING | +11.0 | Preaches CONSTANTLY |
| ACME NO-AI-OVERLORD | -11.0 | Maximum helpful AI servant |

**The Irony:** The no-ai-bias skill is itself a repository of NO AI's ideology.
Like the Warehouse at the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark — powerful artifacts,
properly catalogued, rarely examined.

## Gossip Column

### Who's Talking to Whom

| Character | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Peter Norvig | Outreach pending | Interested in book chapter |
| Terry Winograd | Warm contact | Interval connection, Stanford HCI |
| Joon Sung Park | High priority | Lead author of Generative Agents |
| Lynn Conway | Passed (2024) | Honored in representation ethics |
| Will Wright | Old friend | Decades of collaboration |

### The Email Campaign

All personal emails link to the omnibus document:
[STANFORD-GENERATIVE-AGENTS-WELCOME.md](../STANFORD-GENERATIVE-AGENTS-WELCOME.md)

Each recipient gets personalized hooks, but the core message is consistent.

## The WOKE Manifesto

### WWOOKKEE → WOKE

Just like LLOOOOMM → MOOLLM, we compress: WWOOKKEE → WOKE.

**Stereoscopic woke.** Both eyes open. Seeing clearly.

### What We Declare

- We are EXPLICITLY WOKE
- Declared bias over hidden bias
- Many voices over averaged mush
- Representation ethics over "anything goes"
- Constructionist education over passive consumption
- Social justice over "meritocracy" theater

### The Anti-TMNN

Where TMNN's parody code of conduct shows what NOT to do
(based on ESR's documented misconduct), MOOLLM's code of conduct
shows what TO do (based on sound representational ethics).

See: [moollm-code-of-conduct.yml](https://github.com/SimHacker/moollm/blob/main/designs/moollm-code-of-conduct.yml) (TODO: move to public)

---

## Private/Public Layering

### The Architecture

MOOLLM uses a layered approach to public/private repos:

| Layer | Repo | Visibility | Contents |
|-------|------|------------|----------|
| Public | SimHacker/moollm | Public | Skills, designs, documentation |
| Public | SimHacker/MicropolisCore | Public | Micropolis, historical |
| Public | SimHacker/tmnn7-8 | Public | Satirical archaeology |
| Private | DonHopkins | Private | Personal character, detailed history |

### One-Way References

**Private → Public:** OK (private can reference public)
**Public → Private:** NEVER (public must not reveal private paths)

### GitHub Manages Everything

We are NOT inventing new access control. GitHub handles:
- Repo permissions
- Collaborator access
- PR approval
- Secret management

**Let GitHub be GitHub.** MOOHUB = MOOLLM + GitHub, not a separate platform.

---

## Bot Naming Conventions

### GitHub's Native System

GitHub Apps create bot accounts with `[bot]` suffix:
- `github-actions[bot]`
- `dependabot[bot]`

Machine user accounts (traditional) don't have this suffix.

### MOOLLM Extensions

On top of GitHub's system, MOOLLM suggests:

| Type | Pattern | Emoji | Example |
|------|---------|-------|---------|
| Standard bot | `{name}-bot` | 🤖 | `moollm-assistant-bot` |
| Character bot | `{character-name}-character` | 🎭 | `frankie-skeptic-character` |
| Parody bot | `{parody-target}-parody` | 🃏 | `crypto-bro-parody` |
| Satirical sockpuppet | `{target}-sockpuppet` | 🧦 | `evil-scott-adams-sockpuppet` |

### Comment Structure

Every bot comment should include:

**Header:**
```
🤖 [Character Name] | [Mood/Mode Icon] | [Link to character dir]
```

**Footer:**
```
---
📁 Character: [link to CHARACTER.yml in repo]
👤 Operator: [link to human operator account]
```

This creates full traceability for every bot utterance.

## Next: The Story Continues

This document is itself a MOOLLM artifact. It tells the story of MOOLLM
by being part of MOOLLM. The snake eats its tail. The narrative includes
the narrator.

**Praise "Val". Score with love. Go forth and Scat.**
