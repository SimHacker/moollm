# Character Simulation Index

For researchers and practitioners interested in believable AI agents,
emergent behavior, and the lineage from The Sims to modern LLM agents.

## Core Design Documents

### The Vision
| Document | What It Covers |
|----------|----------------|
| [MOOLLM-MANIFESTO.md](../MOOLLM-MANIFESTO.md) | The full vision: speed-of-light, many voices, microworlds |
| [GITHUB-AS-MMORPG.md](../GITHUB-AS-MMORPG.md) | GitHub as persistent world, characters as actors |
| [MOOLLM-EVAL-INCARNATE-FRAMEWORK.md](../MOOLLM-EVAL-INCARNATE-FRAMEWORK.md) | Deep architecture, intellectual genealogy |

### The Lineage
| Document | What It Covers |
|----------|----------------|
| [VISUAL-PROGRAMMING-LINEAGE.md](../VISUAL-PROGRAMMING-LINEAGE.md) | Papert → The Sims → MOOLLM thread |
| [CONNECTIONS-MAP-FRAME-SCHEMA-MICROWORLD.md](../CONNECTIONS-MAP-FRAME-SCHEMA-MICROWORLD.md) | Minsky, Papert, schema theory connections |

## Key Skills for Character Simulation

| Skill | What It Does |
|-------|--------------|
| [skills/character/](../../skills/character/) | Character definition, personality, traits |
| [skills/incarnation/](../../skills/incarnation/) | Gold-standard character creation process |
| [skills/adventure/](../../skills/adventure/) | Room-based exploration with characters |
| [skills/society-of-mind/](../../skills/society-of-mind/) | Minsky's agencies, K-lines, internal debate |
| [skills/adversarial-committee/](../../skills/adversarial-committee/) | Multi-perspective deliberation |
| [skills/debate/](../../skills/debate/) | Structured argument between characters |
| [skills/needs/](../../skills/needs/) | The Sims-style motive system |
| [skills/advertisement/](../../skills/advertisement/) | How objects call to characters |

---

## Proof It Works

| Example | What Happened |
|---------|---------------|
| [examples/adventure-4/](../../examples/adventure-4/) | 150+ file microworld with rich character interactions |
| [Marathon Session](../../examples/adventure-4/characters/real-people/don-hopkins/sessions/marathon-session.md) | 6000+ lines, 33-turn Fluxx, emergent behavior |
| [Palm's Philosophy](../../examples/adventure-4/pub/stage/palm-nook/study/palm-on-being-palm.md) | A character who wrote his own soul |

## The Research Connection

The Stanford Generative Agents paper (Park et al., 2023) validates what
The Sims designed but couldn't fully implement in 1997:

| The Sims (1997) | Generative Agents (2023) | MOOLLM (2025) |
|-----------------|--------------------------|---------------|
| Motive tracking | Memory streams | K-lines + files |
| Social relationships | Reflection mechanism | Debating experts |
| Activity scheduling | Planning architecture | Speed-of-light |
| Emergent stories | Valentine's Day party | GitHub as stage |

## Who This Index Is For

- **Stanford Generative Agents researchers** — You built what we designed
- **Game AI researchers** — Character simulation, emergent narrative
- **Interactive fiction developers** — Procedural storytelling
- **Digital humanities scholars** — Simulation as argument
- **Janet Murray's students** — Agency, immersion, transformation
