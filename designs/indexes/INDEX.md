## How to Use These Indexes

1. **Identify your audience** — Who are you writing to?
2. **Pick the right index** — Character sim? Ethics? Education?
3. **Customize the highlights** — Pull 3-5 best links for that person
4. **Point to the index** — "For more, see [INDEX]"

*Indexes are K-lines — names that activate the right conceptual cluster.*
