core_ideas:
  method_of_loci: "Ancient Greek memorization — remember things by places linked together"
  memory_palace: "Construct imaginary rooms connected together, remember by walking through"
  rooms_as_data: "Each locus has an image, title, description, URL — a structured data node"
  network_not_hierarchy: "A network of menus, not a tree — kiss nodes together to connect them"
  things_in_rooms: "Rooms contain objects — buttons, links, images, text overlaid on photos"
  publishing_from_play: "Edit on device, upload to server, server publishes browsable website"
  save_file_as_website: "ZIP save file → SQL database → HTML pages indexed by Google"

architecture:
  client: "iPhone app (Objective-C) — map editor, pie menu navigator, built-in web browser"
  server: "Python/TurboGears + SQLAlchemy + Genshi templates"
  protocol: "ioki:// URL scheme — web pages talk to app as if it were another server"
  data_format: "JSON structures passed between app and web via ioki:// URLs"
  upload: "ZIP file containing map + loci → server parses, validates, stores in SQL"
  download: "Browse server content, download ZIP back to device"

construction_tools:
  implemented:
    - "Search Amazon for books (auto-import with image, title, URL)"
  planned:
    - "Search Flickr for photos"
    - "Search YouTube for videos"
    - "Search Google for links/images/videos"
    - "Map locations via Google Maps"
    - "Import RSS feeds"
    - "Import OPML outlines"
    - "Templates for phone calls, emails, contacts"
    - "Import Facebook friends"

key_patterns:
  kiss_to_connect: "Drag two nodes close together to create a link between them"
  drill_down: "Double-tap a locus to open its URL in built-in browser"
  edit_mode: "Multi-touch gesture toggles between browse and edit"
  web_as_extension: "Hard UI stays in Objective-C, content-type-specific editing in web views"
  content_agnostic: "Each locus is a dictionary — any JSON structure works"
  server_as_amplifier: "Upload ZIP → server → browsable website with Google indexing"

heritage:
  dreamscape: |
    Kaleida Labs (Apple + IBM), 1995. ScriptX multimedia language.
    Adventure map editor: rooms connected by bumping them together.
    Web publishing tool: live content previewed as HTML, downloadable as interactive.
  the_sims: |
    Take pictures of gameplay, write stories, save game publishes web pages.
    Go online, read stories, look at houses in a browser, download save files.
    The same pattern: rich interactive state → published HTML → downloadable source.
  hypercard: |
    Flip into edit mode at any time. New button, stick here. New text field, stick there.
    iLoci wants the same: take a photo, overlay buttons linking to Facebook/web/phone.

moollm_descendants:
  memory_palace: "Directories are rooms, files are knowledge items — direct descendant"
  room: "Directory as activation context — iLoci's loci ARE rooms"
  adventure: "Room-based exploration with objects — iLoci's things-in-rooms"
  inventory: "Carry pointers, set down to materialize — iLoci's drag-between-maps"
  postal: "Universal addressing — iLoci's ioki:// URL scheme for app-as-server"
  visualizer: "Each locus has an image — visual generation per room"
  adventure_compiler: "ZIP save file → compiled world.json — iLoci's ZIP → SQL"
  psiber: "Step inside data structures — iLoci's drill-down into any locus"
