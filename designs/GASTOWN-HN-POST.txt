Gas Town vs MOOLLM: Two Approaches to Multi-Agent Orchestration

Steve Yegge's Gas Town and my MOOLLM framework are siblings from the same Eval Empire -- both believe LLMs are universal interpreters, both embrace whimsy, both push boundaries. The difference is resource constraints shaping design.

Gas Town explores "what if tokens were free?" -- 20-30 Claude instances running overnight, hierarchical agent roles, external coordination via mail and nudges. MOOLLM explores "what if tokens were precious?" -- many agents, many turns, one LLM call. Speed of Light instead of Carrier Pigeons.

I wrote a detailed comparison after reading Maggie Appleton's critique and the HN discussion. The analysis covers intellectual lineage (Self, Minsky's K-lines, The Sims, LambdaMOO, ToonTalk), falsifiability (our Amsterdam Fluxx Marathon I just ran tonight: 116+ turns times 4 characters, 94/100 rubric score), and the "vibecoded" problem -- why MOOLLM is LLM-generated but rigorously reviewed, iterated, not ship-and-hope.

Key contrasts:
- Gas Town: external processes, carrier pigeon IPC, "never look at the code"
- MOOLLM: internal simulation, speed of light messaging, constitutional transparency

Both systems have value. Gas Town for throughput when budget is unlimited. MOOLLM for coherence when every token counts.

Happy to discuss tradeoffs, answer questions, or hear where MOOLLM's claims don't hold up. Falsifiable criticism welcome.
