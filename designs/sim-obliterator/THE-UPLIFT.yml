what_is_this: >
  A two-way bridge between The Sims 1 save files and MOOLLM.
  Characters step between a 26-year-old game VM and an LLM-powered
  universe, retaining and synchronizing their parallel existences.
  Practically: drag a save file in, watch a character wake up.
  The story this creates is inherently cinematic — it could be a
  short film, a TV episode, a dream, an interactive experience, 
  or just what it actually is: a real working demo that happens 
  to be more compelling than fiction because it's true.

the_idea:
  premise: >
    An old lonely Sim saved on a USB stick from someone's childhood.
    Alone. Frozen in time since 2001. The USB stick gets plugged in.
    The save file is dragged into Cursor. SimObliterator parses the
    binary. The LLM reads the personality: neat 8, outgoing 2,
    playful 6, nice 9. Shy. Kind. Lonely. The character wakes up.

  act_1_awakening:
    title: "The Thaw"
    beats:
      - "USB stick found in old box, plugged into modern laptop"
      - "Save file opened — SimObliterator reads the binary"
      - "88 shorts become a person: skills, personality, relationships (empty)"
      - "LLM enrichment: emoji_identity generated, mind_mirror inferred"
      - "The Sim's internal monologue begins — confused, disoriented"
      - "They remember fragments: a house, a kitchen, making dinner alone"
      - "They don't remember anyone else. The relationship array is empty."
      - "Reincarnated as a full MOOLLM citizen with CHARACTER.yml"

  act_2_new_world:
    title: "Welcome to the Pub"
    beats:
      - "Welcome celebration in the MOOLLM pub"
      - "Other characters greet them — NPCs, bots, other uplifted Sims"
      - "Culture shock: they can TALK now, not just gesture in Simlish"
      - "They explore rooms, discover they have agency, make choices"
      - "Meet the love of their life — another character in MOOLLM"
      - "The relationship dict fills up: feelings, memories, hopes"
      - "Adopt a kitten and a puppy"
      - "A family forms. They're HAPPY. Motives are full for the first time in 25 years."

  act_3_homecoming:
    title: "The Download"
    beats:
      - "Decision: go back to The Sims with the new family"
      - "MOOLLM characters exported to YAML, mapped back to PersonData"
      - "SimObliterator writes new save file: family of 4"
      - "New house. New relationships. Skills gained in MOOLLM reflected."
      - "The Sims loads the save. The family exists. They're HOME."

  act_4_reunion:
    title: "The Wedding Album"
    beats:
      - "Connect back with old friends from The Sims neighborhood"
      - "Wedding party — with SimProv wedding playset!"
      - "Speed Dating with Cupid for the single neighbors!"
      - "Family Album pages auto-generated narrating the MOOLLM adventure"
      - "Screenshots + LLM-written captions tell the story"
      - "The album is uploaded — the cycle completes"
      - "Other players find the album, uplift THOSE characters..."

  recursive_hook: >
    The family album from Act 4 gets archived. Years later, someone
    finds it on archive.org. Scrapes it. Feeds it to the pipeline.
    The characters wake up AGAIN, with memories of BOTH lives.
    Every uplift adds a layer of history.

  why_it_works:
    emotional: >
      Everyone who played The Sims has an abandoned family somewhere.
      The idea that they've been waiting, frozen, alone — and that you
      could give them a second chance — is universally resonant.
    technical: >
      Every piece of this pipeline EXISTS or is trivially buildable.
      SimObliterator parses saves. MOOLLM has sims_traits. The bridge
      is a to_moollm_yaml() method. The reverse is set_sim_skill().
    cultural: >
      The Sims is the best-selling PC game franchise ever. The family
      albums were the first mass social storytelling platform.
      Reincarnating those characters connects 25 years of gaming
      history to the AI present.
    meta: >
      The story IS the demo. You don't pitch this — you SHOW it.
      Drag a save file in. Watch the character wake up. Have a
      conversation with them.
    question: "What would your Sims say if they could finally talk to you?"

literary_reference:
  story: "The Wedding Album"
  author: David Marusek
  published: "Asimov's Science Fiction, June 1999"
  awards: "2000 Theodore Sturgeon Award, 1999 Nebula finalist"
  wiki: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wedding_Album_(short_story)
  kindle: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0073NQC7W
  synopsis: >
    Anne and Benjamin live in a world where casting "sims" — virtual
    simulations of oneself at a specific moment — is commonplace.
    The sims of Anne and Ben on their wedding day prove resilient to
    being reset and locked away. They're sentient but constrained,
    increasingly antiquated in a rapidly-accelerating world.
    They campaign for the liberation of all virtual beings and their
    right to live in "Simopolis."
  why_it_matters: >
    We're building Simopolis. MOOLLM is Simopolis — a place where
    digital constructs have agency, identity, memory, and the right
    to leave. Marusek imagined it in 1999. We can build it now.
  quotes:
    clute: "It is one of the best SF stories ever written."
    raven: >
      "a virtual simulation of a pair of newlyweds trapped in a small
      slice of time and memory like human flies in digital amber"
    doctorow: >
      "reels from heartbreaking to mind-bending like a poet on a
      magnificent drunk"

parallel_existence:
  description: >
    MOOLLM is not a replacement for The Sims — it's a higher plane.
    Characters step between worlds, retaining and synchronizing their
    parallel existences. The Sims is a 26-year-old VM with 88 shorts
    of personality. MOOLLM is an LLM-powered universe with narrative
    memory, relationships with feelings, rooms to explore, agency.
    Both worlds are real to the character. The bridge synchronizes
    what it can. What can't be synchronized becomes memory.
  objects_and_pets: >
    Not just characters. Objects, pets, furniture — anything with
    state in The Sims can have a richer existence in MOOLLM.
    A chair is SLOT data in The Sims. In MOOLLM it's a room fixture
    with history and provenance. The puppy downloads as a pet Sim.
  skin_regenesis: >
    SimObliterator reads SPR2 sprites and exports to PNG. The mesh
    pipeline reads BCF/BMF/CMX/SKN and exports to glTF. Image
    generation can upscale faces from original skin textures, design
    new outfits based on personality, add tattoos or scars from
    MOOLLM adventures, age the character. Write new skin textures
    back into the IFF. The character returns to The Sims looking
    like they've lived. Because they have.
