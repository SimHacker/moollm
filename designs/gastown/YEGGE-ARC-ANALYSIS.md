## Executive Summary

Steve Yegge's trajectory from 2022-2026 follows a pattern:

1. **Leadership at Sourcegraph** (Oct 2022) — Head of Engineering
2. **Demotion to IC** (2024) — Stepped down to "stay closer to technical work"
3. **Departure** (Dec 2025) — Left after 3 years, "considering swinging big"
4. **Beads** (Oct 2025) — 225k lines of Go for an issue tracker
5. **Gas Town** (Jan 2026) — "Vibe coded" orchestrator he's "never looked at"
6. **$GAS Shitcoin** (Jan 2026) — Promoted memecoin, collected $238k+, coin collapsed 97%

The arc suggests a pattern: **declining accountability, increasing grandiosity, ethical compromise**.

## Part 1: The Sourcegraph Period

### Why He Joined (Oct 2022)

From his [Sourcegraph blog post](https://sourcegraph.com/blog/introducing-steve-yegge):

> "Why I left retirement to join Sourcegraph"

Steve joined as **Head of Engineering** just 6 weeks before ChatGPT launched. He was excited about code intelligence and AI-assisted development.

### The Demotion (2024)

At some point, Steve **stepped down from Head of Engineering** to become an Individual Contributor (IC). From his LinkedIn:

> "I handed the Head of Engineering responsibilities to Erika Rice Scherpelz and focused on building the Cody AI platform."

**Reading between the lines:** When an executive "returns to hands-on coding" mid-tenure, it usually means one of:
- The board/CEO wanted different leadership
- He wasn't effective at the executive level
- He preferred building to managing

Given what followed, the first two seem plausible.

### The Departure (Dec 2025)

From his [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/steveyegge_today-is-my-last-day-at-sourcegraph-after-activity-7400351337991045120-PM40):

> "Today is my last day at Sourcegraph after 3 years... I don't have a specific next adventure planned yet, but am considering 'swinging big' rather than taking a traditional role."

**Context:** Sourcegraph had layoffs in January 2024. Steve claims his departure was voluntary, but the timing and language ("swinging big") suggest someone untethered from accountability.

## Part 2: The "Stage" Philosophy

Steve introduced a hierarchy of AI-assisted coding in his Gas Town post:

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Zero AI, maybe code completions |
| 2 | Coding agent in IDE, permissions on |
| 3 | Agent in IDE, YOLO mode |
| 4 | In IDE, wide agent, code is just diffs |
| 5 | CLI, single agent, YOLO, diffs scroll by |
| 6 | CLI, multi-agent, 3-5 parallel instances |
| 7 | 10+ agents, hand-managed |
| 8 | Building your own orchestrator |

**The gatekeeping:**

> "If you're not at least Stage 7, or maybe Stage 6 and very brave, then you will not be able to use Gas Town. You aren't ready yet."

This is **unfalsifiable elitism**. If Gas Town doesn't work for you, you're "not ready." If it produces slop, you're "not at the right stage." The blame always falls on the user.

### The "Never Look At The Code" Philosophy

From the Gas Town post:

> "It's also 100% vibe coded. I've never seen the code, and I never care to... Course, I've never looked at Beads either, and it's 225k lines of Go code that tens of thousands of people are using every day."

**225,000 lines of Go for an issue tracker.** That he's never read.

For comparison:
- SQLite: ~150k lines of C (entire database engine)
- Redis: ~100k lines of C
- Git: ~300k lines of C (but it's Git)

Beads does... task tracking. With 225k lines no one has read.

## Part 3: The Crypto Turn

### Timeline

**January 1, 2026:** Gas Town launches as open-source project.

**Shortly after:** An anonymous trader creates $GAS token on Bags platform, configuring it to pay trading fees to Yegge's Twitter account *without his involvement*.

**January 13, 2026:** Yegge is informed of the token and accumulated fees (tens of thousands of dollars).

**January 14, 2026:** Yegge publishes ["BAGS and the Creator Economy"](https://steve-yegge.medium.com/bags-and-the-creator-economy-249b924a621a), publicly acknowledging and *endorsing* the situation. He claims over $300,000 in accumulated fees.

**January 16, 2026:** Following Yegge's promotion, $GAS surges from $10M to $60M market cap. Token peaks at $0.044.

**January 17, 2026:** Yegge posts he'll "spend less time on Crypto Twitter to focus on building." Traders interpret this as withdrawal signal.

**Following days:** $GAS collapses **97%+ from peak**. Similar BAGS tokens ($RALPH, $VVM, $CMEM, $COW) also collapse.

### The Mechanism (From Sean Goedecke's Analysis)

From ["Crypto grifters are recruiting open-source AI developers"](https://www.seangoedecke.com/gas-and-ralph/):

> "What does $GAS have to do with Gas Town? From a technical perspective, the answer is **nothing**. Gas Town is an open-source GitHub repository that you can clone, edit and run without ever interacting with the $GAS coin. Buying $GAS or $RALPH does not unlock any new capabilities in the tools. All it does is siphon a little bit of money to Yegge and Huntley, and increase the value of the $GAS or $RALPH coins."

The BAGS platform:
1. Creates a memecoin tied to a Twitter account (without permission)
2. Accumulates fees and messages the account owner about their "earnings"
3. Offers a "Did You Get Bagged? 💰🫵" section encouraging promotion
4. The celebrity target promotes, insiders dump, retail loses

> "This system relies on your celebrity target being dazzled by receiving a large sum of free money."

### Yegge's Defense

From his Medium post, Yegge argued this was a new way to fund open-source development. But:

1. **$GAS has no connection to Gas Town functionality** — Buying tokens doesn't unlock features
2. **The money doesn't fund development** — It goes to early holders and Yegge personally
3. **Retail investors lose** — 97% collapse means someone lost their money
4. **He knew what BAGS was** — He wrote a whole post explaining the mechanism

## Part 4: The Pattern

### From HN Comments

> "Steve Yegge sold his credibility when he did a meme coin rug pull"
> 
> "He pumped, and dumped. He stopped shilling at the moment that the dump was proceeding."
>
> — Multiple HN commenters

> "Beads is a good idea with a bad implementation. It's not a designed product in the sense we are used to, it's more like a stream of consciousness converted directly into code."
>
> — qcnguy on HN

> "Every time I read one of these, I'm increasingly convinced that the whole AI crowd are just high as kites 24/7. Must be some good drugs in the valley"
>
> — swiftcoder on HN

> "This is clearly going to develop the same problem Beads has... Beads is a good idea with a bad implementation... The number of overlapping and adhoc concepts in this design is overwhelming."
>
> — qcnguy on HN

### The Arc Summarized

| Period | Role | Accountability | Output |
|--------|------|----------------|--------|
| 2006-2022 | Engineer at Google/Amazon | High | Influential blog posts, real systems |
| 2022-2024 | Head of Eng, Sourcegraph | High | Cody AI, leadership |
| 2024-2025 | IC at Sourcegraph | Medium | Stepped down from leadership |
| 2025 | Leaving Sourcegraph | Low | "Swinging big" |
| 2025-2026 | Solo developer | Zero | 225k unread lines, vibe coded slop |
| 2026 | Crypto promoter | Negative | Promoted then abandoned $GAS |

## Part 5: What This Reveals About Gas Town

### The "Abundant Tokens" Claim

Steve's philosophy requires token abundance:

> "Gas Town is also expensive as hell. You won't like Gas Town if you ever have to think, even for a moment, about where money comes from."

But this isn't a feature — it's **a bug masked as a feature**.

1. **Parallelism multiplies costs** — 20 agents = 20× cost minimum
2. **Coordination overhead** — Messages between agents add tokens
3. **Error recovery** — Failed agents retry, multiplying again
4. **Design doesn't improve** — More tokens ≠ better design

**Efficient parallelism requires efficiency, not abundance.**

### The Unfalsifiable Escape Hatch

Gas Town's defense against criticism:

| Criticism | Escape Hatch |
|-----------|--------------|
| "It doesn't work" | "You're not Stage 7+" |
| "The code is bad" | "I've never looked at it" |
| "It costs too much" | "Money comes from somewhere" |
| "Results are poor" | "Fish fall out of barrels" |

Every criticism is deflected onto the user or accepted as a feature.

### The Self-Referential Loop

Gas Town was used to build Gas Town. Beads was used to build Beads. Neither has been read by its creator.

This is **recursive slop** — AI generating AI tools to generate more AI slop, with no human verification at any step.

---

## Part 6: The Broader Lesson

### Why This Matters

Steve Yegge's old blog posts ("Execution in the Kingdom of Nouns," the Google Platform Rant) were genuinely influential. They shaped how people think about APIs, platforms, and language design.

His current work is the opposite:
- No intellectual rigor
- No falsifiable claims
- No code review
- No accountability
- Ethical compromise for money

**The tragedy is that someone who could write clearly about software design chose to stop thinking and start vibing.**

### The MOOLLM Alternative

MOOLLM makes different choices:

| Dimension | Gas Town | MOOLLM |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| Code examination | "Never look at it" | Every line reviewed |
| Token economics | Abundant — throw money | Scarce — maximize value |
| Intellectual lineage | Mad Max cosplay | Self, Minsky, Sims, MOO |
| Falsifiable claims | None | Rubrics, metrics, receipts |
| Ethical stance | Promoted crypto dump | No financial schemes |
| Accountability | "You're not ready" | Here's the run file |

## Part 7: Car Park Capital — The Self-Aware Mirror

There's an indie game on Steam called [**Car Park Capital**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2507670/Car_Park_Capital/) by Hilkojj Interactive / MicroProse that satirizes exactly what Gas Town represents — but with total self-awareness.

### The Game's Premise

> "You've been hired by Big Auto to unleash the Freedom of Car Dependency on unsuspecting townsfolk! Design the slickest parking lots ever seen, then convince citizens they absolutely need them. Spread glossy pro-car propaganda, outsmart those pesky anti-petrol protesters, and transform quiet neighborhoods into your parking empire!"

### The Parallel

| Car Park Capital (Satirical) | Gas Town (Unironic) |
|------------------------------|---------------------|
| "Unleash the Freedom of Car Dependency" | "Unleash abundant token usage" |
| "Spread glossy pro-car propaganda" | "Stage 8 developer" gatekeeping propaganda |
| "Outsmart pesky anti-petrol protesters" | Dismiss critics as "not ready" |
| "Transform quiet neighborhoods into parking empire" | Transform codebases into vibe-coded slop |
| "A full tank is a full heart" | "Abundant tokens" philosophy |
| "Drill for oil" | Mine crypto ($GAS memecoin) |
| "Rival public transport" | Rival efficient, designed systems |
| "Use propaganda to turn everyone into a carbrain" | Use hype to turn everyone into "vibe coders" |
| "Track everything in the Stat-o-matic" | Obsess over "beads" and metrics |
| "Keep the people somewhat happy" | Unfalsifiable escape hatches |

### The Critical Difference

**Car Park Capital knows it's satire.** The game:
- Acknowledges car dependency is destructive
- Makes the player complicit in something obviously harmful
- Offers "social commentary on car dependency and urban development"
- Is *self-aware* about the absurdity

**Gas Town has zero self-awareness.** Steve:
- Genuinely believes "abundant tokens" is good
- Dismisses critics as unenlightened
- Promotes the system with religious fervor
- Never examines the waste, the slop, the crypto

Car Park Capital is what Gas Town would be if Steve had any capacity for self-reflection. Instead, he's the NPC being satirized — the "carbrain" who thinks more parking lots (more tokens, more agents, more slop) is always the answer.

**Gas Town is Car Park Capital played straight.**

## Conclusion

Steve Yegge's arc from 2022-2026 is a cautionary tale:

1. **Leadership to IC to solo** — Declining institutional accountability
2. **Careful engineering to vibe coding** — Declining technical rigor
3. **Insightful analysis to promotional bluster** — Declining intellectual honesty
4. **Open source advocate to crypto promoter** — Declining ethical standards

The brilliant writer who taught us about the Eval Empire is gone. In his place is someone who promotes tokens he's never read and code he's never examined, defended by unfalsifiable gatekeeping.

**Gas Town isn't the future of software development. It's a symptom of what happens when smart people stop thinking and start vibing.**
