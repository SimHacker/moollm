# CHANGES: The Complete History of MOOLLM

> *A James Burke-style journey through every commit, tweet by tweet.*
> *Append-only. No conclusions. Just history flowing forward.*

## How to Append (The PUSH Protocol)

**When user says "PUSH" — do this ONCE:**

1. `git log --oneline -20` — see recent commits
2. Find where this file left off (last documented hash)
3. **Retrocon:** Replace any `(this)` with the actual hash you now know
4. **Add entries** for all commits since the last documented one
5. **End with `(this)`** for the commit you're about to make
6. Commit and push — **ONE commit, done**

**CRITICAL — DO NOT:**
- Make a second commit just to fill in `(this)` — that loops forever!
- The `(this)` gets filled in NEXT time someone appends
- Leaving one `(this)` at the end is CORRECT behavior

**Format:** `**\`hash\`** title` followed by `> James Burke tweet`

**Era headers:** OK to add `## Era N: Title` sections thematically

**The file just ENDS. No conclusions. Ready for next append.**

---

## PR Description Protocol

**When creating a Pull Request:**

1. Ask user to paste the GitHub PR comparison page (commit list, files changed)
2. Write a PR description as a **markdown code block** the user can copy
3. Include:
   - **TL;DR** — one-line summary
   - **Key Changes** — grouped thematically with emoji headers
   - **Files Changed** — bullet list of affected files with brief descriptions
4. Use tables where appropriate for invocation/incarnation, mode comparisons, etc.

> THIS document. 490 commits narrated. 19 eras traced. James Burke guiding you through every connection. The history becomes navigable. 📜

**`fc58adf`** README: Link to CHANGES.md history and all session logs
> The top-level README learns to point downward. History accessible. Sessions discoverable. Entry points multiply. 🔗

**`5a37bf5`** QUICKSTART: Recommend adventure-4, frame 1-3 as prototypes
> Adventure-4 is the canonical starting point now. The earlier ones were sketches. Beautiful sketches, but sketches. Start with the best. 🎯

**`67d8d38`** Add James Burke to Television Icons section
> The man himself joins the character roster! "Connections!" His job: narrate K-line traversals. "And THAT brings us to..." 📺

**`e6a6aa5`** Expand fictional characters with hybrid rich/compact format
> Some characters deserve paragraphs. Others need evocative phrases. Blade Runner gets essays. Background characters get signature lines. Hybrid documentation. 📚

**`0d4d076`** Fix PR-K-LINES-SAFARI.md references (uppercase)
> The user uppercased the filename. Every reference must follow. Consistency is love. CASE SENSITIVITY is a harsh mistress. 🔤

**`2d48f9c`** Feature Lem's Constructors: Trurl, Klapaucius, and The Seventh Sally
> SIMCITY'S ORIGIN STORY. Stanisław Lem wrote about a kingdom in a box. Will Wright read it and made SimCity. The Cyberiad becomes canon. Trurl builds. Klapaucius critiques. ⚙️

**`a829a2b`** Expand Gong Show panel with wonderful chaotic judges

> Bob Newbie, tutorial victim. Bella Goth, THE mystery. Don Lothario, the SCOUNDREL. Agnes Crumplebottom, purse-wielding moral enforcer. 👜 The Sims joins the roster. MOOLLM's direct ancestor. 🏠

**`722f587`** Transform characters/ into Grand Central Station of Souls

**`a10ce83`** Add furry fandom acknowledgment to animal characters

**`a8a7047`** Fix K-LINE description to reference Minsky's concept
> K-LINE isn't a "referee." It's Minsky's connector! "I link ideas together — touch me and wake a whole constellation!" The description earns its name. 🧠

**`ff20a31`** Clarify leela-ai slogan: double meaning of Manufacturing Intelligence

> 40+ skill links woven through the session. Every concept clickable. The web of K-lines made visible. 🕸️

**`71dbc89`** Fix Palm directory listing to match actual filesystem
> No fictional directories. Reality over imagination. The monkey's home is what it actually is. 🐒

**`3fe76ac`** Split Palm's Character from Palm's Home in k-line-connections.md
> Soul files vs physical space. CHARACTER.yml vs pub/stage/palm-nook/. The distinction matters. 🏠💫

**`ae0cfba`** Add Invocation vs Incarnation distinction + Annie Hall Protocol
> Summon vs create. Temporary vs persistent. McLuhan materializes to correct misinformation with compassion. 📽️

**`baf8e03`** Polish Annie Hall Protocol references
> Marshall McLuhan as foundational influencer. Real people deserve ethical framing. Tributes, not imposters. 🎭

> Everything visible to both. No hidden state. The microworld is transparent to all observers. 👁️

**`e7c926c`** Layout adversarial committee horizontally, shorten labels
> Many-voiced deliberation rendered clearly. Committee sits side by side, not stacked. 🪑🪑🪑

**`0a4f14c`** Fix lineage diagram: SimCity→Sims→MOOLLM, MOO→MOOLLM
> Historical accuracy matters. LambdaMOO didn't lead to The Sims. Two rivers converge on MOOLLM. 🌊🌊

**`201daef`** Fix consent hierarchy Mermaid diagram wrapping
> Horizontal layout, shortened labels. Consent levels readable at a glance. ✅

**`c0af118`** Fix Mermaid parse error: remove quotes from node label

**`e0b6da9`** Clarify LLM as oracle, not engine
> Compiled worlds run fast without LLM. Call oracle for wisdom, not speed. Engine + Oracle. 🏎️🔮

### Era 24: The Astrillogical Effect

> *"They should call them Astrillogical Signs!"* -- Don Hopkins, 2017. Zero code, maximum perceived effect.

**`e9f462a`** Add sims-astrology.md: The Astrillogical Effect
> 1997: The Sims zodiac had zero behavioral code -- testers reported it was "too strong." 2026: LLM zodiac experiment rediscovers same phenomenon. K-lines explain both. One voice is the wrong number -- adversarial committees beat mode-collapse. Leary's MIND MIRROR meets gwern's critique. Deep links to Palm, Bartender, adventure-uplift. 🔮♐🎭

---

### Era 25: The Full Team

> *Manufacturing Intelligence requires manufacturing intelligences.*

**`36509b6`** Add full Leela AI team to skills
> Henry Minsky (CTO), Cyrus Shaoul (Chief Evangelist), Milan Singh Minsky (VP Product), Sheung Li (VP Applications), Steve Kommrusch (Senior AI Research). Plus Don Hopkins. Society of Mind runs in the company too. 👥🏭🧠

**`7d25b37`** Add SKILL.md front matter, remove FPS claims
> Six SKILL.md files now have proper YAML front matter (leela-ai, manufacturing-intelligence, society-of-mind, simulator-effect, incarnation, logistic-container). Removed specific FPS claims from Leela examples -- no promises we can't keep. 📋✅

**`737ee69`** Add moollm tag to all skills, document PDA three-layer architecture
> Every SKILL.md now tagged with moollm -- 37 files branded. Leela's PDA documented as third LLM layer atop symbolic SQL: generate, perform, interpret, explain, visualize, remember. Neural at the surface, symbolic in the protocol. 🏷️🏭

**`3a05de2`** Add tags to 45 remaining SKILL.md files
> All 83 SKILL.md files now have proper YAML front matter with moollm tag. The skill catalog is complete and greppable. 📋✅

### Era 26: Link Archaeology

> *Dead links are broken promises. Fix all of them.*

**`507428a`** Fix all session log links, verify Medium URLs, enhance return-stack and mind-mirror
> Session logs moved from adventure-4/sessions/ to characters/real-people/don-hopkins/sessions/marathon-session.md -- 47 broken links fixed across 16 files. Fixed link text AND destination (don-session-1.md → marathon-session.md). Medium URLs verified via HTTP 200 checks. PSIBER Space and DSHR blog URLs corrected. Return-stack skill now documents Self language's dynamic deoptimization -- LLM reconstructs causality on demand like Self reconstructs stack traces. Mind-mirror tells Leary's prison escape story: understanding the system grants power to transcend it. Proof links to 33-turn Fluxx with proper hash anchors. 🔗📚🔙🐒

---

### Era 27: The Discourse

> *antirez writes about AI. The internet responds. MOOLLM analyzes both.*

**`(this)`** Add antirez AI hype analysis
> antirez (Redis creator) claims AI changed programming forever. HN explodes: 1227 comments, 1022 points. Skeptics: "70% rewrite after review." Optimists: "hours instead of weeks." The key insight: codebase entropy determines success. MOOLLM's K-lines, rooms, and rubrics are anti-entropy architecture. The debate validates the framework. 📊🔥💬
