# Visual Programming Lineage: From Smalltalk to MOOLLM

A trail of ideas connecting constructionist education, visual programming,
character simulation, and modern LLM orchestration.

## The Thread

### 1970s-80s: Foundations

**Smalltalk** (Alan Kay, Xerox PARC)
- Objects all the way down
- Live editing environment
- Kids as target audience

**Logo** (Seymour Papert, MIT)
- Microworlds for learning
- Turtles as thinking tools
- "Learning by making"

**HyperCard** (Bill Atkinson, Apple)
- Stacks and cards metaphor
- Direct manipulation editing
- Scripting for everyone (HyperTalk)

### 1980s-90s: NeWS Era

**NeWS** (James Gosling, Sun)
- PostScript as code, graphics, AND data
- Networked extensible window system
- Architecturally similar to what became AJAX

**HyperLook** (Arthur van Hoff, Turing Institute)
- HyperCard for NeWS
- PostScript scripting
- Property sheets as editable stacks
- [HyperLook Article](https://medium.com/@donhopkins/hyperlook-nee-hypernews-nee-g...)

**PSIBER Space Deck** (Don Hopkins)
- Visual PostScript debugging
- "Consensual hallucination" of data structures
- [PSIBER Space](https://donhopkins.medium.com/the-shape-of-psiber-space-oct...)

### 1990s: Interval Research Era

At Interval Research Corporation (Paul Allen's "PARC for the 90s"),
several threads converged:

**Bounce / Body Electric** (David Levitt)
- Visual data flow programming
- Real-time music and animation
- Lessons: pure data flow is unwieldy for complex state

**MediaFlow** (Marc Davis)
- Visual programming for video processing
- Semantic annotation (before AI vision)
- "Professional video by hobbyists with camcorders"
- [MediaFlow Design Discussion](https://donhopkins.com/home/interval/mediaflow-design.html)

**Embedded Constraint Graphics** (Tom Ngo)
- Create interactive graphics from target examples
- Interpolate between states on simplicial complexes
- Patent US5933150

**Component Technology Survey** (Don Hopkins)
- [Pluggers Survey](https://donhopkins.com/home/interval/pluggers) — snapshot of 1996
- [IFC vs Bongo](https://donhopkins.com/home/interval/ifc-vs-bongo.html) — Java frameworks compared

Key insight from Richard Gabriel's *Patterns of Software*:
> "Data and control abstractions are generally best when they are codesigned,
> and this is rarely done any more."

### 1996-2000: The Sims Era

**SimAntics** (Maxis/EA)
- Character simulation visual programming language
- Simple local rules → complex global behavior
- Players as authors, not just consumers

Will Wright's progression:
- SimAnt: Too simple
- SimEarth: Too complex  
- SimCity 2000: Just right
- The Sims: EVEN SWEETER — simple for kids, complex for artists

Don's contributions:
- SimAntics documentation and cleanup
- Mac to Windows UI rewrite
- Pie menu interaction system
- Extensive testing and exploration

### 2000s-2010s: Constructionist Platforms

**Scratch** (Mitchel Resnick, MIT Media Lab)
- Block-based visual programming
- Seymour Papert's constructionism realized
- Millions of young programmers

**Snap!** (Brian Harvey, Jens Mönig)
- First-class procedures and data
- Build Your Own Blocks
- Connects to Berkeley CS curriculum

### 2020s: MOOLLM

MOOLLM synthesizes these threads:

**From Minsky's Society of Mind:**
- Debating experts, not single-voice averaging
- K-lines as tradition activation
- NO-AI-* suite prevents pathologies

**From constructionism:**
- Microworlds for exploration
- Learning by building
- Students as researchers

**From The Sims:**
- Character simulation with emergent behavior
- Speed-of-light: 8 characters × 99 turns in ONE call
- Memory + reflection + planning (realized with LLMs)

**From GitHub as MMORPG:**
- Social collaboration features as game mechanics
- Characters as bots in discussions, reviews, flame wars
- Branches as parallel universes

## The Connection to Generative Agents

The Stanford Generative Agents paper (Park et al., 2023) finally builds
what we designed in 1997 but couldn't implement without LLMs:

| The Sims (1997) | Generative Agents (2023) |
|-----------------|--------------------------|
| Motive tracking | Reflection mechanism |
| Social relationships | Memory streams |
| Activity scheduling | Planning architecture |
| Emergent behavior | Valentine's Day party |

MOOLLM extends this with:
- Multiple debating perspectives (not averaged)
- GitHub as persistent world state
- Composable Anthropic skills
- Real-world AIOps applications

*This document traces the intellectual lineage from Papert and Kay through
The Sims to modern LLM-based agents. The thread is continuous: microworlds,
direct manipulation, character simulation, constructionist learning.*
