# Designs

> *Raw source material and historical archives.*

Where ideas are born before they crystallize.

> [!NOTE]
> **This is the PLAY archive.** Raw material that crystallized into kernel and skills. Read for context, not for current specs.

## Purpose

This directory contains:

- **Early drafts** before crystallization
- **Chat transcripts** with valuable ideas
- **Design explorations** that informed the system
- **Historical context** for archaeology

These files are **not polished documentation**.  
They're the messy workshop where ideas are forged.

## The PLAY-LEARN-LIFT Journey

```
PLAY (here, in designs/)
  ↓
LEARN (extract patterns)
  ↓
LIFT (crystallize into kernel/, skills/)
```

These files are the **PLAY** phase — messy exploration.

The refined results live in [kernel/](../kernel/) and [skills/](../skills/).

## Mining for Ideas

When you find something valuable here:

1. **Don't delete it** — preserve the journey
2. **Extract the insight** — what's the core idea?
3. **Crystallize it** — add to appropriate kernel/ or skills/
4. **Link back** — reference the origin for archaeology

Per [PRESERVE-JOURNEY](../PROTOCOLS.yml): the path to the solution IS the value.

## Key Insights Extracted

| From | Became |
|------|--------|
| MOOLLM-MANIFESTO.md | [PROTOCOLS.yml](../PROTOCOLS.yml) symbols |
| kilroy-ideas.md | [ITS-ABOUT-TIME](../PROTOCOLS.yml), [PLAY-LEARN-LIFT](../PROTOCOLS.yml) |
| constitution-design | [kernel/constitution-core.md](../kernel/constitution-core.md) |

## The Intertwingularity

Designs are the attic. Raw material before crystallization.
