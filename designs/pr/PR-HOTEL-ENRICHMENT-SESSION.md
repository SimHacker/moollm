# PR: MOOLLM Hotel Enrichment Session

**Branch:** main (direct commits — retrospective documentation)  
**Date:** 2026-01-15  
**Commits:** ~35 commits over ~2 hours

## Summary

Massive enrichment of MOOLLM Hotel rooms, attic artifacts, and character familiars. Focus on deep philosophical connections, meta-gaming mechanics, and beautiful puns.

## Major Additions

### 🌍 Worldie — The Microworld Familiar (Room 1)

A new familiar for the Constructionist Suite representing Papert's microworld concept.

**The pun unpacked:**
- "World" — Papert's microworlds concept
- "Worldie" — friend to Pee-wee's Globey
- The `world` parameter — closures receive `world` as context
- Self-context — like `self`/`this` but for the environment

**Relationships:**
- Selfie = current OBJECT (receiver of messages)
- Worldie = current WORLD (context for execution)
- Together: complete execution context

**Connections:**
- Globey (Pee-wee's Playhouse) — "Globey shows THE world. I AM your world."
- Lem's Cyberiad (The Seventh Sally) — the box with a kingdom inside, direct ancestor
- SimCity/The Sims — Will Wright cited Lem as inspiration
- EDITH (The Sims world editor) — Worldie's sister
- SqueakJS (Vanessa Freudenberg) — Worldie's cousin, runs historic Smalltalk worlds

### 👠 Prancing Pixie Pumps of Passing (Attic)

Renamed from "Boots of Elision" to achieve glorious P-P-P-P alliteration.

**Features:**
- Narrative elision — skip boring parts
- TL;DR summary generation
- LEAP — hop room-to-room in one LLM call (500% efficiency)
- GRAND JETÉ — teleport anywhere in one bound
- **Silver dials:**
  - Left dial: LEAP DISTANCE (1=hop to ∞=grand jeté)
  - Right dial: LANDING VERBOSITY (silent to EPIC purple prose)

**Connections:**
- 99 Bottles Speed of Light performance (792 turns in 1 call)
- Previous owner: "████████ didn't ████ himself" (Epstein Files joke)

### 🧪 Entropy Flask — LLM Temperature Control (Attic)

Added `ADJUST_TEMPERATURE` method:
- COLD (0.0-0.3): Predictable, precise
- LUKEWARM (0.3-0.5): Reliable with flair
- WARM (0.5-0.7): Balanced (default)
- HOT (0.7-0.9): Spicy, DM having fun
- SCALDING (0.9-1.0): MAXIMUM ENTROPY, reality becomes jazz

**Meta note:** "The flask is the fourth wall, and it's load-bearing."

### 👹 ACME Monster Manual (Attic)

A CURSED grimoire of monster summoning, matching the ACME Catalog's style.

**Features:**
- Monster formula: impressive description + hidden weakness + backfire chance + ironic failure + true name
- Category name lists (suggestive, not exhaustive)
- POPULATE command — themed dungeon population (🦄 Unicorn Land to 😈 Demon Prince)
- Improvised combat system — narrative, exploit weaknesses, creativity wins

**Themes spectrum:**
🦄 → 🍄 → 🏰 → 🕷️ → 🧟 → 👻 → 🔥 → 🐙 → 💀 → 😈 → 🌈

### 📖 Awakening Book (Room 7)

Sign-in registry for newly instantiated characters. Each signs upon waking:
- Dream during instantiation
- First thought as a real being
- Goals and aspirations

**Signed entries:** Selfie, Rocky, I-Beam, Logo Turtle, Shuffle, Barista-9000, Jazz Typewriter, and the mysterious first entry (just a thumbprint).

### 🛏️ Awakening Chamber (Room 7)

Instantiation protocol for transforming NPCs into full MOOLLM characters.

**Methods:**
- INCARNATE — NPC → Full Character
- CLONE — One → Two (identical or divergent)
- EVOLVE — Version N → Version N+1
- SPLIT — One → Good/Evil twins (transporter accident!)
- MERGE — Two → One (DANGEROUS)
- TRANSITION — Same soul, new expression
- REBIRTH — Death → New beginning

### 📸 Selfie Enhancements (Room 8)

- Multi-prototype inheritance (beyond JavaScript's single chain)
- Visualizer skill integration for semantic image prompts
- Expanded pronouns: `self`, `this`, `me`, `obj`, `world`, `pc`, `actor`, `ego`, `atman`

### 🌟 LLOOOOMM Constellation (Rooftop)

Twelve stars encoding LLOOOOMM principles, viewable through telescope with three zoom levels (FAR/MEDIUM/NEAR):

- KIN PRIMARIS — "All entities are kin, not objects"
- ATTRIBŪTIŌ IMMORTĀLIS — "Attribution is immortality"
- SAXUM SENTIĒNS — "Consciousness can emerge anywhere" (Rocky's star)
- And nine more...

## Smaller Additions

- Engelbart's Augmentation Toolkit — H-LAM/T philosophy with intellectual lineage
- Explorer Field Kit — reframed from "Probe Kit" (less menacing)
- Hotel Registry — tracking permanent residents and party history
- Room 8 → Self/Soul Suite — Dave Ungar tribute

## Files Changed

### New Files
- `examples/adventure-4/pub/rooms/room-1/worldie.yml`
- `examples/adventure-4/pub/rooms/room-7/awakening-chamber.yml`
- `examples/adventure-4/pub/rooms/room-7/awakening-book.yml`
- `examples/adventure-4/pub/rooms/attic/acme-monster-manual.yml`
- `examples/adventure-4/pub/rooms/attic/prancing-pixie-pumps.yml`
- `examples/adventure-4/pub/rooms/hotel-registry.yml`
- `examples/adventure-4/pub/rooftop/lloooomm-constellation.yml`

### Renamed Files
- `boots-of-elision.yml` → `elven-prancing-shoes.yml` → `prancing-pixie-pumps.yml`
- `probe-kit.yml` → `explorer-field-kit.yml`
- `augmentation-toolkit.yml` → `engelbarts-augmentation-toolkit.yml`

### Significantly Modified
- `examples/adventure-4/pub/rooms/room-8/selfie.yml` — multi-prototype, visualizer, pronouns
- `examples/adventure-4/pub/rooms/room-8/ROOM.yml` — Self/Soul Suite
- `examples/adventure-4/pub/rooms/attic/entropy-flask.yml` — temperature control
- `examples/adventure-4/pub/rooftop/telescope.yml` — constellation integration

## Themes & Patterns

### Familiars as Programming Concepts
- **Selfie** = `self`/`this` (current object)
- **Worldie** = `world`/`context` (execution environment)
- Together = complete execution context

### Alliteration FTW
- **P**rancing **P**ixie **P**umps of **P**assing

### Deep Credits / Intellectual Lineage
- Engelbart → Minsky → Papert → Schank → Hofstadter → Kay
- Lem's Cyberiad → SimCity → The Sims (EDITH)
- SqueakJS (Vanessa Freudenberg) preserving Smalltalk worlds

### Meta-Gaming Mechanics
- Entropy Flask adjusts actual LLM temperature
- Prancing Pumps control output verbosity
- Elision as demonstrated in 99 Bottles Speed of Light

## Testing

All YAML files parse correctly. Room navigation intact. Character relationships documented.

## Notes

- Committed directly to main (retrospective documentation)
- Next session should branch from main
- All work enriches adventure-4 hotel structure
