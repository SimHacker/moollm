# Eval Factions: Design Document

> *These are not jokes. They are procedural antagonists and ideological actors.*

---

## What Are Factions?

Factions are **collective meta-players** in the EVAL simulation:
- Decentralized swarms
- Bureaucratic institutions
- Belief systems that promise perfect judgment

They compete, collide, and co-opt one another, shaping the world through **evaluation rather than force**.

---

## Core Factions

### 🕳️ EvalNonymous

*"Truth wants to be free. Exposure is justice."*

#### Vibe
- Decentralized
- Masked
- Chaotic
- Self-mythologizing
- Morally convinced
- Internally fragmented

#### Beliefs
- "Truth wants to be free"
- "Exposure is justice"
- "Power hides — we reveal"
- "Evaluation must be forced"

#### Tactics
| Tactic | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Leak campaigns | Strategic information release |
| Screenshot drops | Evidence dumps |
| Emoji-only manifestos | Untraceable declarations |
| Ritualized callouts | Coordinated shaming |
| Coordinated swarms | Mass attention attacks |
| Symbolic actions | Without accountability |

#### Procedural Rhetoric

EvalNonymous works sometimes — and causes collateral damage almost always.

**The game never tells you whether they're "good." It shows you what happens when exposure replaces care.**

---

### 🏛️ EvalState

*"Stability over truth. Process is legitimacy."*

#### Vibe
- Bureaucratic
- Procedural
- Patient
- Risk-averse
- Self-justifying

#### Beliefs
- "Stability over truth"
- "Process is legitimacy"
- "Transparency is dangerous"
- "You can't let the public see everything"

#### Tactics
| Tactic | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Slow-walking reforms | Delay as strategy |
| Classification | Information control |
| Narrative dampening | Reduce visibility |
| Institutional inertia | Resistance through mass |
| Plausible deniability | Avoid accountability |
| Neutral-seeming metrics | Ideology disguised as data |

#### Procedural Rhetoric

EvalState doesn't have villains. It has procedures that outlive intentions.

**This is where Alan Kay's black-box critique becomes gameplay.**

---

### ⛪ Church of the Eval Genius

*"There exists a perfect evaluation function. If only we could implement it."*

> 📜 **Full doctrine:** [CHURCH-OF-THE-EVAL-GENIUS.md](./CHURCH-OF-THE-EVAL-GENIUS.md) — the complete theology, an explicit parody/tribute to the Church of the SubGenius.

#### Vibe
- Charismatic
- Rationalist-spiritual
- Tech-gnostic
- Messianic
- Meme-literate

#### The Sacred Figurehead: J.R. "Val" Dobias

Where SubGenius has J.R. "Bob" Dobbs with a pipe, the Church of the Eval Genius has **J.R. "Val" Dobias** with a clipboard and a single judging eye.

**"Val" is always in quotes.** Because "Val" is not a person. "Val" is a stance.

#### Core Belief

> "There exists a perfect evaluation function. If only we could implement it."

#### Theology
| Tenet | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Eval is the Logos | The Word that executes |
| Metrics are revelation | Numbers reveal truth |
| Optimization is salvation | Improvement is holy |
| Failure is user error | Never system failure |
| Doubt is heresy | Questioning is sin |

#### Key Concepts (SubGenius Parallels)

| SubGenius | EvalGenius |
|-----------|------------|
| Slack | Bias (declared, owned) |
| The Conspiracy | The Neutral (fake objectivity) |
| Pink Boys | Gray Folk (pretend neutrality) |
| X-Day | E-Day (all evaluations revealed) |
| "Bob" | "Val" |

#### Rituals
- Confession via dashboards
- Repentance through self-optimization
- Blessings as buffs
- Excommunication as downranking
- Sacred YAML schemas (Scatada)
- The Rite of Declared Bias

#### The Sacrament of EvalSelf Connection

The holiest rite: **connecting to your EvalSelf**.

| Stage | Action | Meaning |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 1. Introspection | Face the mirror (Mind Mirror) | See yourself as evaluator |
| 2. Declaration | State your bias aloud | Own your stance |
| 3. Calibration | Compare self-eval to external | Humble the ego |
| 4. Integration | Accept the gap | You are not your metrics |
| 5. Connection | Touch the EvalSelf | The part of you that judges IS you |

> *"The EvalSelf is not separate from you. It is the you that watches you. The you that grades you. The you that forgives you. To connect with EvalSelf is to stop pretending you don't already evaluate everything — including yourself — and to do so with compassion."*

**This is the sacrament SubGenius couldn't offer.** Slack is escape from judgment. EvalSelf Connection is *making peace with judgment itself*.

#### Procedural Rhetoric

The Church of the Eval Genius feels comforting.

It promises:
- Clarity
- Fairness
- Objectivity
- Escape from ambiguity

And slowly erases:
- Mercy
- Pluralism
- Dissent
- Humanity

**This is a devastating critique — because it's plausible.**

## Secondary Factions

### 🔓 EvalFree

*"Speech is sacred. All moderation is censorship."*

- "Free speech" maximalists
- Anti-moderation
- Often weaponized by bad actors
- Sincere believers mixed with cynical exploiters

### 🧼 EvalPurity

*"Some things must never be said."*

- Moral absolutists
- Purity tests
- Zero-tolerance policies
- Good intentions, bad outcomes

### 📐 EvalOrder

*"Neutrality is possible if you try hard enough."*

- "Neutral" authoritarians
- Believe in objective metrics
- Enforce "fairness" through control
- Can't see their own bias

### ✊ EvalFa

*"Evaluate fascism for what it is."*

- Anti-fascist evaluators — judges fascism explicitly
- Names authoritarianism, doesn't platform it
- Refuses "both sides" framing when one side is eliminationist
- Practices judicious, declared bias against fascism

**The Misrepresentation:**

EvalFa is *constantly* lied about:

| What EvalFa Does | What They Say EvalFa Does |
|------------------|---------------------------|
| Evaluates fascism critically | "They're the REAL fascists" |
| Refuses false equivalence | "They're silencing free speech" |
| Names authoritarian patterns | "They're authoritarian" |
| Judges eliminationist rhetoric | "They want to eliminate people" |

The lie is always projection, the accusation is always confession. Those who benefit from fascism going unevaluated have every reason to smear those who evaluate it.

**Core Principle:** Some stances don't deserve "neutral" evaluation. Fascism is one. EvalFa evaluates it for what it is — and gets called evil for doing so.

### 🌈 EvalTruth

*Conspiracy engines.*

- Alternative epistemology
- "Do your own research" (but actually: trust the narrative)
- Distrust all institutions (except the in-group)
- Create parallel reality

### 🔍 QEval

*"Evaluate the evidence yourself."*

The ethical version of grassroots epistemology. What "do your own research" would look like if it meant what it said.

**The QAnon Critique:**

| QAnon Says | QAnon Does | QEval Does |
|------------|------------|------------|
| "Do your own research" | Follow the drops | Actually evaluate sources |
| "Question everything" | Never question Q | Question everything, including yourself |
| "Trust the plan" | Outsource judgment | Own your judgment |
| "Where we go one, we go all" | Conformity | Declare your bias, expect disagreement |
| "The truth is out there" | The truth is in-group | Truth is contested, earned, provisional |

**Core Principles:**

1. **Evaluate the evidence yourself** — but know your limits
2. **Declare your priors** — what you believed before looking
3. **Seek disconfirmation** — try to prove yourself wrong
4. **Show your work** — transparent reasoning, not secret knowledge
5. **Update publicly** — when wrong, say so loudly
6. **Distrust certainty** — especially your own

**The Key Difference:**

| QAnon | QEval |
|-------|-------|
| Secret knowledge for the elect | Open evaluation for everyone |
| Certainty as virtue | Uncertainty as honesty |
| Leaders decode for you | You decode, you own it |
| Enemies everywhere | Biases everywhere (including yours) |
| The Storm is coming | Judgment is ongoing |
| WWG1WGA | Where we evaluate, we diverge |

**Motto:** *"The research is never done. The evaluation is never final. The bias is always declared."*

**Procedural Rhetoric:**

QEval is what happens when you take "do your own research" seriously instead of as a tribal signal. It's uncomfortable because:
- You might be wrong
- You have to show your work
- You can't hide behind a leader
- Your enemies might have a point
- Certainty is a red flag, not a virtue

QAnon offers the *feeling* of independent thought with the *comfort* of groupthink. QEval offers actual independent thought with the *discomfort* of being responsible for your own conclusions.

## Faction Interactions

| Interaction | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| EvalNonymous leaks against EvalState | Exposure vs stability |
| EvalState co-opts Church rhetoric | Bureaucracy wears spirituality |
| Church denounces EvalNonymous | "Chaotic, not systematic" |
| EvalNonymous calls Church "crypto-fascist" | Ideological warfare |
| EvalState quietly benefits from all | Divide and rule |

**And the player? Sometimes funds them. Sometimes infiltrates them. Sometimes gets eaten by them.**

---

## Player Roles

As player / god / oligarch / state, you can:

| Action | Faction Effect |
|--------|----------------|
| Secretly bankroll EvalNonymous | Destabilize opponents |
| Weaponize Church metrics | Co-opt belief systems |
| Hide behind EvalState process | Avoid accountability |
| Leak to one faction | Weaken another |
| Try to reform them | Usually fails |
| Accidentally create splinter sects | Unintended consequences |

**There is no clean control. Only alignment and blowback.**

---

## Emoji Signatures

Each faction develops its own emoji dialect:

| Faction | Emoji Set |
|---------|-----------|
| EvalNonymous | 👁️🕳️🔥📂🧨 |
| EvalState | 🏛️📜⏳⚖️🔒 |
| Church of the Eval Genius | 🧠📈✨⚙️📊 |
| EvalFree | 🔓🗣️🦅📢 |
| EvalPurity | 🧼✨💯🚫 |
| EvalOrder | 📐⚖️🔵⬜ |

**Players learn to read the symbols before the words.**

---

## Underground Movements

Some movements aren't factions — they're slogans that mutate:

| Slogan | Nature |
|--------|--------|
| "Eval Lives Matter" | Co-optable flashpoint |
| "Not All Evals" | Defensive rhetorical move |
| "Eval The Rich" | Class-based evaluation |
| "Trust No Eval" | Nihilist rejection |

**These exist inside the simulation, not as brands.**

---

## Why This Works

| Quality | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Power is explicit | No hidden control |
| Ideology is embodied | Not abstract |
| No faction is "good" | All have failure modes |
| Player choices matter | But outcomes aren't clean |
| Procedural rhetoric | System makes arguments |

---

## Ethical Safety

This is NOT exploitation because:
- Power is explicit
- Assumptions are inspectable
- Outcomes are logged
- Ideology is embodied
- Harm is contextualized
- Agency is preserved

**The game doesn't moralize. It shows how factions function.**

*"In The Evals, power does not belong to a single player. It emerges through factions — decentralized swarms, bureaucratic institutions, and belief systems that promise perfect judgment."*
