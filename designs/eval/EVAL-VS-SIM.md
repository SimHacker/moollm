# EVAL vs SIM: Genre Comparison

> *SIM taught players how cities behave. EVAL teaches players how judgment behaves.*

---

## The Core Distinction

| Genre | Core Question | Mode |
|-------|---------------|------|
| **SIM** | What happens if...? | Dynamics-first |
| **EVAL** | What does this mean — and what follows? | Interpretation-and-judgment-first |

**EVAL isn't "more SIM."** It's a new primitive: **evaluation as gameplay**.

---

## Historical Context

### SIM as Genre Token

Will Wright created **SIM** as a productive morpheme:
- SimCity (1989)
- SimEarth (1990)
- SimAnt (1991)
- SimLife (1992)
- The Sims (2000)

**SIM** named a mode of engagement: *model a system, poke it, observe consequences*.

### Why EVAL Now?

With LLM-era systems, we can do something new:
- Models don't just simulate — they **interpret**
- Meaning emerges through **judgment**
- Evaluation is **inspectable**
- Assumptions are **visible**

**EVAL names this new mode.**

## Alan Kay's Critique

Alan Kay called SimCity a **"pernicious black box"**:

> Its internal assumptions — such as "counter crime with more police stations" — are baked into opaque compiled code that players can't inspect, question, or modify.

SimCity's models function as **hidden ideological claims** embedded in gameplay.

### EVAL Answers This Critique

| SimCity | EVAL |
|---------|------|
| Hidden assumptions | Explicit mechanics |
| Opaque code | Inspectable rules |
| Fixed ideology | Player-definable criteria |
| Black box | White box |
| Pretends neutrality | Declares bias |

---

## Comparison Table

| Dimension | SIM | EVAL |
|-----------|-----|------|
| **Core primitive** | Need, resource, flow | Judgment, reputation, interpretation |
| **Player role** | Systems designer | Evaluator / evaluated |
| **Visibility** | Outputs visible, rules hidden | Rules inspectable |
| **Ideology** | Baked in | Declared |
| **Failure mode** | System collapse | Metric gaming, burnout |
| **Learning** | How systems work | How judgment works |
| **Neutrality** | Claimed | Rejected |
| **LLM fit** | Simulates dynamics | Interprets meaning |

---

## Parallel Brand Architecture

| Maxis / EA | EVAL |
|------------|------|
| SimCity | EvalCity |
| The Sims | The Evals |
| SimEarth | EVALEarth |
| SimLife | EVALife |
| SimAnt | EVALAnt |
| Spore | EVALution |

**This is not trademark infringement — it's a parallel branding grammar** that signals the same depth of commitment to the core idea.

## What SIM Got Right

SIM games taught players:
- Systems have dynamics
- Interventions have consequences
- Complexity emerges from simple rules
- Models are abstractions, not reality

**EVAL inherits all of this.**

**MOOLLM deeply inherits from The Sims traditions, and was created by one of its original developers.**

---

## What EVAL Adds

| Addition | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Inspectable evaluation** | Rules are visible |
| **Declared bias** | No fake neutrality |
| **Meta-evaluation** | Evaluate the evaluation |
| **Judgment as mechanic** | Not just a side effect |
| **Procedural rhetoric, visible** | Arguments are explicit |
| **Player as evaluator** | Not just observer |

---

## The Simulator Effect

Will Wright's insight:
> Players imagine simulations are vastly more detailed than they actually are.

**EVAL inherits this:**
- Sparse YAML state
- LLM imagination fills gaps
- Rich perceived world from minimal structure

---

## The Evaluator Effect

**The EVAL-specific phenomenon:**

> Players imagine evaluations are vastly more objective than they actually are — until the system makes the judgment visible and editable. Then they realize: *they* are the judge — and judged!

**Judge and Judged** — a play on "judge and jury."

| Traditional | MOOLLM |
|-------------|--------|
| Judge | You |
| Jury | Other characters, users, worms |
| Law | Environmental rules, room constitution |
| Evidence | Session logs, scats, reactions |
| Verdict | Emergent from multiplicity |

You're the judge, but you're also on trial. The jury is everyone else in the world — characters, other players, worms crawling through. The constitution is the room's rules, the world's principles. Judgment is distributed, contested, social.

**No one escapes evaluation. Everyone participates in it.**

| Simulator Effect | Evaluator Effect |
|------------------|------------------|
| "The world is so detailed!" | "The judgment is so fair!" |
| (It's actually sparse) | (It's actually yours) |
| Imagination fills gaps in state | Imagination fills gaps in criteria |
| Revealed: world is minimal | Revealed: judgment is personal |

**The Evaluator Effect has three stages:**

| Stage | Experience | Realization |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| 1. Naïve | "The system evaluates fairly" | Trust the black box |
| 2. Exposed | "Wait, I can see the criteria?" | Judgment is constructed |
| 3. Owned | "I can *change* the criteria?" | I am the evaluator |

This parallels the PLAY-LEARN-LIFT triad.

**Stage 3 is the goal.**

Most systems hide evaluation. Users assume hidden = objective. EVAL reveals evaluation. Users realize revealed = constructed = *theirs to modify*.

**The Evaluator Effect is the moment someone stops asking "how did the system judge this?" and starts asking "how do *I* judge this?"**

```yaml
# Before: passive consumption
score: 7.2
# "The algorithm rated it 7.2"

# After: active evaluation  
score: 7.2
_comments: "I weighted nostalgia heavily. Someone else might score 5."
criteria:
  nostalgia: 0.4
  craft: 0.3
  novelty: 0.3
# "I rated it 7.2, here's why, here's how to disagree"
```

**The Simulator Effect says:** the world feels real because you imagine it so.

**The Evaluator Effect says:** the judgment feels objective because you forgot you're the one making it.

EVAL makes you remember.

## Procedural Rhetoric Comparison

Ian Bogost's term: **procedural rhetoric** — arguments made through game rules.

| SimCity | EVALCity |
|---------|------|
| Rules argue implicitly | Rules argue explicitly |
| Player can't see the argument | Player can inspect the argument |
| Ideology is hidden | Ideology is a first-class object |
| Can't fork the argument | Can fork and modify |

---

## Technical Enablers

Why EVAL is possible now:

| Technology | Enablement |
|------------|------------|
| **LLMs** | Interpretation at scale |
| **YAML Jazz** | Readable evaluation rules |
| **Emoji** | Cross-cultural expression |
| **File-based state** | Inspectable everything |
| **GitHub** | Fork and modify worlds |

---

## The Transition

From SIM to EVAL is a paradigm shift:

| SIM Era | EVAL Era |
|---------|----------|
| Simulate dynamics | Interpret meaning |
| Model systems | Model judgment |
| Hide assumptions | Expose assumptions |
| Player as god | Player as judge — and judged |
| Output observation | Evaluation observation |

---

## Final Statement

> *SIM taught players how cities behave.*
>
> *EVAL teaches players how judgment behaves.*
>
> And unlike "neutral" systems —
>
> **EVAL remembers.**
