## What Is The Evals?

**The Evals** is the EVAL version of The Sims — a social life simulation where **judgment, not needs, is the core mechanic**.

| The Sims asks | The Evals asks |
|---------------|----------------|
| What happens if you give agents needs, objects, and time? | What happens if you give agents opinions, judgments, reputations, and memory? |

The core simulation primitive is not **need**. It is **evaluation**.

---

## Core Fantasy

You don't control people directly.

You control:
- norms
- reputation systems
- metrics
- visibility
- forgiveness
- shame
- attention
- moderation policies

**You don't move characters. You shape how they judge and are judged.**

---

## Core Loop

### Traditional Sims Loop

1. Needs decay
2. Player satisfies needs
3. Skills increase
4. Objects unlock
5. Stories emerge

### The Evals Loop

1. Agents encounter situations
2. Agents evaluate each other
3. Judgments propagate socially
4. Reputation shifts
5. Behavior adapts
6. Norms drift
7. You intervene (or don't)
8. Consequences accumulate

**The player isn't God. The player is the scoring system.**

## What Are "Evals" (The Beings)?

An Eval has:

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Beliefs** | What they think is true |
| **Values** | What they think matters |
| **Biases** | Systematic distortions |
| **Memory of judgments** | What they've decided about others |
| **Social graphs** | Who they know and how |
| **Performative identity** | How they present themselves |
| **Coping strategies** | How they handle judgment |
| **Capacity for hypocrisy** | Gap between stated and actual values |

They:
- Talk about each other
- Judge silently
- Signal publicly
- Perform virtue
- Defect privately
- Rationalize later

---

## Needs → Pressures

Instead of hunger / bladder / sleep, Evals feel:

| Pressure | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Social approval | Need to be liked |
| Status anxiety | Fear of falling |
| Moral dissonance | Conflict between actions and values |
| Reputation debt | Accumulated judgment against them |
| Visibility pressure | Stress of being watched |
| Shame / pride balance | Emotional accounting |
| Belonging vs authenticity | Conformity tension |

**You don't feed them. You expose them.**

---

## Objects → Instruments of Judgment

| In The Sims | In The Evals |
|-------------|--------------|
| Couch = comfort | Feed = visibility |
| Toilet = bladder | Like button = endorsement |
| Fridge = hunger | Block = exclusion |
| | Report = sanction |
| | Algorithm = fate |
| | Moderation flag = existential threat |

**Furniture becomes infrastructure.**

---

## Homes → Platforms

Lots aren't houses. They're:
- Group chats
- Forums
- Offices
- Schools
- Newsrooms
- Group DMs
- Meme factories

**Walls are audience boundaries. Doors are access controls.**

---

## Mobile Interface: The Feed

The primary interface is a **simulated social feed** — like Instagram/TikTok/Twitter.

### What You See

Posts look like:
- Selfies with captions
- Passive-aggressive subtweets
- Celebration posts
- Breakdown posts
- Call-out threads
- Apology videos
- "I'm logging off" announcements
- Screenshots of DMs
- Inside jokes you half-understand

**All generated. All contextual. All persistent.**

### Generated Media

Each Eval can post:
- AI-generated photos (consistent identity)
- Stylized selfies
- Memes
- Short looping videos
- Reaction clips
- "Story" snippets

Content is motivated by:
- Their traits
- Their current reputation
- Recent judgments
- Media incentives
- **What you did or didn't do**

---

## Two-Way Interaction

### You Can:

| Action | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Like | Signal approval |
| React | Emotional response |
| Reply | Public engagement |
| Quote | Amplification with commentary |
| DM | Private influence |
| Ghost | Silence as judgment |
| Mute | Personal filtering |
| Block | Exclusion |
| Report | Sanction request |
| Screenshot | Evidence collection |
| Forward | Information spread |

**Each is an evaluative act. The system remembers.**

### They Can:

Evals can:
- DM you
- Ask for advice
- Ask for judgment
- Ask for intervention
- Ask for validation
- Ask for silence

**The soap opera knows you're watching.**

---

## Prayer as Mechanic

Sometimes an Eval messages:
> "I don't know what I did wrong."

**That's prayer.**

Sometimes they say:
> "Everyone hates me. Is it over?"

**That's prayer.**

You are not required to answer. But **your silence is also an answer**.

---

## Public Suggestion Channels

Players can:
- Propose plot interventions
- Suggest character actions
- Predict outcomes
- Argue ethics
- Rally votes

**Most popular ideas get translated into the simulation** as:
- Rumors
- Environmental changes
- Character impulses
- Media trends
- Institutional responses

**The crowd doesn't write the script. The crowd changes the weather.**

---

## Blessings, Curses, Buffs

All "supernatural" mechanics are delivered through **ordinary communication**:

| Mechanic | Delivery |
|----------|----------|
| Blessing | DM with positive attachment |
| Curse | Public call-out |
| Buff | Reputation boost |
| Debuff | Scrutiny increase |
| Confession | Private DM to priest |
| Repentance | Public or private ritual |

**Nothing supernatural. Just reputation physics.**

---

## Media as Ideological Actors

In-game newspapers, TV, influencers each have:
- An agenda
- A worldview
- Incentives
- Blind spots
- Preferred villains
- Sacred cows

They:
- Frame events
- Select narratives
- Amplify conflicts
- Ignore inconvenient facts
- Shape reputations

**They are not neutral relays. They are active evaluators.**

---

## Power Modes

As player / god / oligarch / state, you can:

| Action | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Fund bot networks | Influence operations |
| Buy social platforms | Rule changes |
| Manipulate media | Narrative control |
| Change algorithms | Attention allocation |
| Fire moderation | Chaos unleashed |
| Restore banned accounts | Signal to extremists |

**And immediately experience blowback.**

---

## Why This Works

| Quality | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Short interactions | 2-5 minute sessions |
| High emotional payoff | Drama, connection, guilt |
| Asynchronous play | World runs without you |
| Persistent world | Consequences accumulate |
| Social hooks | Share, discuss, compare |
| No grind | Just judgment |
| No twitch skill | Just attention and care |

---

## Pedagogical Power

This teaches, without preaching:
- Media literacy
- Algorithmic influence
- Social pressure
- Moral injury
- Performative identity
- Why moderation is hard
- Why "just asking questions" is never neutral

**By letting players feel the system working.**

---

## Final Framing

> The Sims revealed the hidden labor of domestic life.
>
> **The Evals reveals the hidden violence of social judgment.**

And like The Sims:
- It's funny
- It's cruel
- It's empathetic
- It's emergent
- It's unforgettable
