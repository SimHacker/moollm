# EVAL Design Documents

> *SIM asked: "What happens if...?" EVAL asks: "What does this mean — and what follows from that?"*

This directory contains design documents for the **EVAL** game genre and philosophy — a new simulation paradigm where **evaluation is the core mechanic**, not just a side effect.

| [EVAL-TAXONOMY.md](./EVAL-TAXONOMY.md) | Entity types, autonomy levels, dialects, code-switching |

---

## Systems & Actors

| Document | What It Covers |
|----------|----------------|

## Lineage & Connections

| Ancestor | EVAL Inheritance |
|----------|------------------|
| **SimCity** | Urban systems → EvalCity (but transparent) |
| **The Sims** | Social life → The Evals |
| **Simlish** | Universal expression → Emoji YAML Jazz |
| **Ian Bogost** | Procedural rhetoric → Eval as staged argument |
| **Alan Kay** | Black box critique → All assumptions visible |

---

## Key Insight

> *SimCity's hidden assumptions are EVAL's explicit mechanics.*

Alan Kay criticized SimCity as a "pernicious black box" — its ideology is baked into opaque code. EVAL answers this directly:

- Evaluative assumptions are **inspectable**
- Players can **define or rewrite** evaluation mechanisms
- Evaluation is **part of the play mechanics**
- Values and judgments are **first-class constructs**

---

## Source Material

The documents in this directory crystallize ideas from:

- [EVAL-INCARNATE-FRAMEWORK.md](./EVAL-INCARNATE-FRAMEWORK.md) — **The master framework document** (Skills are programs. The LLM is eval(). Empathy is the interface.)
- [eval-incarnate-design-chatgpt.txt](./eval-incarnate-design-chatgpt.txt) — 8500+ line conversation with ChatGPT developing these concepts
- [../MOOLLM-MANIFESTO.md](../MOOLLM-MANIFESTO.md) — Core MOOLLM philosophy

## Character Suggestions

Fictional characters that embody EVAL themes — evaluation, authenticity, judgment, consciousness:

| Character | Source | Emoji Identity | Why They Fit |
|-----------|--------|----------------|--------------|
| **🦉🤖✨ Owl Robot** | *Blade Runner* (1982) | 🦉 owl, 🤖 robot, ✨ artificial shimmer | The first question in Blade Runner: "Is it real?" The owl is artificial — and beautiful. EVAL asks: does authenticity matter, or does the performance? |
| **🤖👁️ Roy Batty** | *Blade Runner* | 🤖 replicant, 👁️ Tyrell eye | "I've seen things you people wouldn't believe." Evaluation through witnessed experience. |
| **🧬🔍 Deckard** | *Blade Runner* | 🧬 human(?), 🔍 detective | The evaluator who may himself be evaluated. |
| **🔴🤖 HAL 9000** | *2001* | 🔴 red eye, 🤖 robot | Evaluation gone wrong — or right? |
| **🐑⚡ Philip K. Dick** | Author | 🐑 android dreams, ⚡ electric | The original asker: do androids dream of electric sheep? |

### The Owl's Question

> "Is it artificial?"  
> "Of course it is."  
> "Must be expensive."  
> "Very."

The owl doesn't need to be "real" to be valuable. EVAL games explore this: **what we evaluate as meaningful may be constructed, performed, artificial — and still matter.**

---

## The Mantra

> Meaning arises through judgment.  
> Agency requires evaluation.  
> Execution is incarnation.  
> Evaluation is performance art.
>
> **Eval Incarnate.**  
> **The Show Is the Verdict.**

*"EVAL is the next game genre designing token since SIM — now with LLMs we can EVALuate instead of SIMply SIMulating."*
