# EVAL Design Documents

> *SIM asked: "What happens if...?" EVAL asks: "What does this mean — and what follows from that?"*

This directory contains design documents for the **EVAL** game genre and philosophy — a new simulation paradigm where **evaluation is the core mechanic**, not just a side effect.

---

## Core Philosophy

| Document | What It Covers |
|----------|----------------|
| [EVAL-INCARNATE-PHILOSOPHY.md](./EVAL-INCARNATE-PHILOSOPHY.md) | The foundational thesis: meaning arises through judgment |
| [EVAL-VS-SIM.md](./EVAL-VS-SIM.md) | How EVAL differs from SIM as a genre token |

## Language & Expression

| Document | What It Covers |
|----------|----------------|
| [SCATS-DESIGN.md](./SCATS-DESIGN.md) | Scats: emoji-rich YAML Jazz expressions |
| [EMOJI-ANCHORS.md](./EMOJI-ANCHORS.md) | Outline anchors, eye zones as syntax |
| [EVAL-DOM-SPEC.md](./EVAL-DOM-SPEC.md) | MOOLLM DOM, reserved keywords (_anchors, _comments, etc.) |
| [EVAL-TAXONOMY.md](./EVAL-TAXONOMY.md) | Entity types, autonomy levels, dialects, code-switching |

---

## Systems & Actors

| Document | What It Covers |
|----------|----------------|
| [EVAL-WORMS.md](./EVAL-WORMS.md) | Two-ended interpretive worms, scat castings |
| [EVAL-FACTIONS.md](./EVAL-FACTIONS.md) | EvalNonymous, EvalState, QEval, EvalFa, Church of the Eval Genius |

| [EVAL-TAXONOMY.md](./EVAL-TAXONOMY.md) | Entity types, autonomy levels, personas, dialects, code-switching |

## Lineage & Connections

| Ancestor | EVAL Inheritance |
|----------|------------------|
| **SimCity** | Urban systems → EvalCity (but transparent) |
| **The Sims** | Social life → The Evals |
| **Simlish** | Universal expression → Emoji YAML Jazz |
| **Ian Bogost** | Procedural rhetoric → Eval as staged argument |
| **Alan Kay** | Black box critique → All assumptions visible |

---

## Key Insight

> *SimCity's hidden assumptions are EVAL's explicit mechanics.*

Alan Kay criticized SimCity as a "pernicious black box" — its ideology is baked into opaque code. EVAL answers this directly:

- Evaluative assumptions are **inspectable**
- Players can **define or rewrite** evaluation mechanisms
- Evaluation is **part of the play mechanics**
- Values and judgments are **first-class constructs**

---

## Source Material

The documents in this directory crystallize ideas from:

- [eval-incarnate-design-chatgpt.txt](./eval-incarnate-design-chatgpt.txt) — 8500+ line conversation with ChatGPT developing these concepts
- [../MOOLLM-EVAL-INCARNATE-FRAMEWORK.md](../MOOLLM-EVAL-INCARNATE-FRAMEWORK.md) — Technical framework (the master document)
- [../MOOLLM-MANIFESTO.md](../MOOLLM-MANIFESTO.md) — Core MOOLLM philosophy

---

## The Mantra

> Meaning arises through judgment.  
> Agency requires evaluation.  
> Execution is incarnation.  
> Evaluation is performance art.
>
> **Eval Incarnate.**  
> **The Show Is the Verdict.**

*"EVAL is the next game genre designing token since SIM — now with LLMs we can EVALuate instead of SIMply SIMulating."*
