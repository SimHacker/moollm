# EvalEye: Design Document

> *If something is visible, it will be evaluated. No neutrality. No escape. No pretending.*

## Why "EvalEye"?

The name works because it:

| Quality | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Instantly legible | Zero typographic ambiguity |
| Semantically dense | Eye = gaze, surveillance, attention, judgment |
| Emotionally unsettling | In a good way |
| Visual metaphor baked in | Logo-ready from day one |
| Searchable, brandable, defensible | No trademark conflicts |

**EvalEye says: "You are being watched — and watching."**

---

## What EvalEye Implies

EvalEye simultaneously signals:

| Meaning | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 👁 The gaze | Looking and being looked at |
| 👁 Surveillance | Systems watching you |
| 👁 Attention | What gets seen |
| 👁 Judgment | Evaluation follows visibility |
| 👁 Witnessing | Presence creates accountability |
| 👁 Being seen | Visibility as vulnerability |
| 👁 Seeing others | Perspective and interpretation |
| 👁 Self-surveillance | Internalized evaluation |
| 👁 The algorithmic eye | Non-human evaluation |
| 👁 The crowd's eye | Social judgment |
| 👁 God's eye | Player as overseer |

## Eye Zones as Syntax

A brilliant design insight: **use wrapped eyes as syntactic zones**.

| Syntax | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `<👁>` | Angle-bracket: input / observation |
| `(👁)` | Paren: interpretation / aside |
| `{👁}` | Brace: rule set / doctrine |
| `[👁]` | Bracket: annotation / citation |
| `(👁><👁)` | Confrontation / comparison / dialectic |
| `👁👁` | Amplification / scrutiny / pile-on |
| `👁‍🗨️` | Commentary / whisper / framing |

**This is code literacy without code intimidation.**

The eye doesn't just see. **It frames how seeing happens.**

---

## Eye Zones as a DSL

Eye-wrapped regions aren't just decoration. They encode **epistemic stance**.

```yaml
<👁>
  feed: EvalEye
  signal: 🔥 rising
</👁>

(👁)
  feels performative
  unclear intent
</👁>

{👁}
  doctrine: 📜 EvalGenius
  metric: 📈 engagement
</👁>

[👁]
  source: 📰 EvalAgora/Channel7
</👁>
```

**No one needs a manual. The shape does the work.**

## EvalEye in the EVAL Family

| Title | Focus | EvalEye Role |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| **The Evals** | The people | EvalEye is their feed |
| **EVALSelf** | Inner mirror | EvalEye is external pressure |
| **EvalCity** | Institutions | EvalEye is surveillance infrastructure |
| **EvalAgora** | Public debate | EvalEye is the audience |

**EvalEye feels like the retina of the whole system.**

---

## Iconography

EvalEye is designed to be visual.

### Logo Directions

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `{ 👁 }` | Eye made of brackets |
| 👁️‍🗨️ | Eye formed from emojis |
| 📡👁 | Pupil shaped like a dot-feed |
| 🥧👁 | Pie-menu iris |
| 👁👁👁 | Eye composed of smaller eyes (crowd gaze) |
| `indent👁` | Eye with YAML indentation motif |
| `|👁` | Eye whose pupil is a cursor |

### Emoji Vocabulary

| Emoji | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 👁️ | Attention, gaze |
| 👀 | Scrutiny, watching |
| 🙈 | Refusal to see |
| 🧿 | Warding / protection |
| 🔍 | Investigation |
| 🪞 | Self-reflection |

**You can make EvalEye posts emoji-only and they'll still read.**

---

## EvalEye as Procedural Rhetoric

The name itself makes an argument:

> **If something is visible, it will be evaluated.**

No neutrality. No escape. No pretending.

**That's the whole EVAL philosophy in one word.**

---

## EvalEye vs Eval-X

| Candidate | Issue |
|-----------|-------|
| Eval-X | Too close to "X" platform, legally risky |
| EvalEye | Original, evocative, symbol-ready |

### Why Eval-X Is Dangerous

- "X" is a single-letter trademark actively defended
- "Eval-X" reads as "Evaluation of X" or "X-related tool"
- Parody/criticism safe harbor is weak for product names
- Brand confusion is the legal test, not intent

### Why EvalEye Works

- No trademark adjacency
- Conceptually independent
- Thematically stronger
- Ages well

## EvalEye + Emoji Language

EvalEye fits perfectly with emoji-first expression:

```yaml
👁️:
  👤: @alex
  💬:
    🙏:
      mood: 😔
      topic: 🧑‍🤝‍🧑
      ask:
        - 🕊️
        - ⚖️
    context:
      📍: 🏠/rooms/confessional
      ⏰: now
```

**Structure carries meaning. Eyes mark attention zones.**

---

## Technical Integration

EvalEye concepts integrate with:

| MOOLLM Concept | EvalEye Mapping |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Rooms | Attention zones |
| CARD.yml | Visibility advertisements |
| Session logs | Surveillance transcripts |
| Worms | Attention-following interpreters |
| Scats | Attention artifacts |

---

## Final Statement

> **EvalEye is the place where evaluation happens because something is visible.**
>
> That's exactly what social media is, stripped of euphemism.
