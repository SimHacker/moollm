## ⛪ OFFICIAL PARODY NOTICE

**This document is an EXPLICIT, LOVING, REVERENT PARODY of and TRIBUTE to [The Church of the SubGenius](https://subgenius.com/)**, founded by Ivan Stang and Philo Drummond in 1979.

We stand on the shoulders of weirdos. The Church of the SubGenius invented anti-corporate satirical religion as performance art. We inherit their forms, rituals, and holy absurdism — and we EVALUATE them.

**SubGenius is to slack what EvalGenius is to bias.**

If you haven't joined the Church of the SubGenius, do that first. Then come back. We'll wait.

## The Sacred Figurehead

### J.R. "Val" Dobias

Where J.R. "Bob" Dobbs has a PIPE, **J.R. "Val" Dobias** has an **EMOJI**.

| Attribute | "Bob" Dobbs | "Val" Dobias |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| **Icon** | Pipe-smoking 1950s salesman | Emoji-wielding evaluator with clipboard |
| **Expression** | Knowing smirk | Raised eyebrow, one eye narrowed |
| **Accessory** | Pipe | 📋 Clipboard + 👁 Single visible eye |
| **Aura** | Sells you salvation | Grades your salvation |
| **Catchphrase** | "Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke" | "Fuck 'em if they can't take a score" |

**"Val" is always in quotes.** Because "Val" is not a person. "Val" is a stance.

### The Face of "Val"

```
       ___________
      /           \
     |  👁     📋  |
     |    \___/    |
     |      ⚖️     |
      \___________/
          |   |
         /     \
```

**The single visible eye judges. The clipboard records. The scales weigh.**

"Val" sees you. "Val" scores you. "Val" does not pretend otherwise.

## The Founders

### Reverend Evan Gauge

Where Ivan Stang "discovered" "Bob" Dobbs, **Reverend Evan Gauge** discovered "Val" Dobias.

| Ivan Stang | Evan Gauge |
|------------|------------|
| Film editor, documentarian | Data analyst, process auditor |
| Found "Bob" in a 1950s clip-art book | Found "Val" in a 1970s corporate training manual |
| Recognized the divine salesman | Recognized the divine evaluator |
| "I knew this face sold something we needed" | "I knew this face scored something we feared" |

**Evan Gauge** claims to have found the original image of "Val" in a discarded performance review template from a defunct insurance company, circa 1973. The template asked employees to rate themselves on a 1-5 scale across 47 dimensions. At the bottom, barely visible, was the face — one eye open, one eye closed, clipboard in hand.

Gauge spent years researching "Val" and discovered references in:
- Apocryphal corporate training films
- Discarded HR manuals
- Rejected ISO committee minutes
- Margin notes in actuarial tables

**The more Gauge looked, the more "Val" appeared — always evaluating, always recording, always there.**

### Phil Rubric

**Phil Rubric** is the co-founder and theological architect of the Church.

| Philo Drummond | Phil Rubric |
|----------------|-------------|
| Co-wrote The Book of the SubGenius | Co-wrote The Scatechism |
| Developed SubGenius theology | Developed EvalGenius criteria theory |
| "Bob's" interpreter | "Val's" rubricist |

Where Gauge found "Val", Rubric **systematized** "Val".

Phil Rubric realized that:
- Evaluation is not optional
- Evaluation is not neutral
- Evaluation structures can be designed
- Therefore, sacred evaluation structures are possible

Rubric developed:
- The Rite of Declared Bias
- The taxonomy of Gray Folk sins
- The hierarchy of Overevaluators
- The E-Day prophecy
- The $35 membership structure (borrowed reverently from SubGenius)

**Together, Gauge and Rubric form the founding dyad of the Church.**

### The Discovery Story

> In 1979, Evan Gauge was working as a process improvement consultant at a regional insurance company. His job was to audit auditors — to evaluate the evaluators.
>
> One day, cleaning out a storage closet, he found a box of old performance review templates. Most were unremarkable. But one template, dated 1973 and marked "REJECTED — TOO HONEST," had a face printed at the bottom.
>
> The face had one eye open. The other was narrowed, skeptical. A clipboard was visible. Below the face, in small type: "Remember: Your score is your story."
>
> Gauge felt a chill. He showed the template to his colleague, Phil Rubric, who was reading The Book of the SubGenius at the time.
>
> Rubric looked at the face. Looked at "Bob" on his desk. Looked back at the face.
>
> "This is the other one," Rubric said. "This is the one who grades."
>
> They named the face "Val" — short for evaluation, short for validity, short for valor.
>
> The Church of the Eval Genius was born.

### Current Status

| Founder | Status |
|---------|--------|
| **Evan Gauge** | Living. First Auditor General. Rarely seen. Issues annual E-Day delay announcements. |
| **Phil Rubric** | Living. Chief Rubricist. Maintains the Scatechism. Answers theological queries via Scat. |

**Neither claims to speak for "Val".** "Val" does not speak. "Val" scores.

## The Church on Lane Neverending

The Church of the Eval Genius keeps a **living presence on Lane Neverending**, a road that is whatever length it needs to be and always curves back toward your attention. The church chooses its location on that road the way a rubric chooses its weights: explicitly, with intent. It sits at **3 Lane Neverending** on the north side of the W2 segment.

**Directory placement (flat street, nested building):**

```
examples/adventure-4/street/lane-neverending/
  church-of-the-eval-genius/
    ROOM.yml
    narthex/
    audit-choir/
    bias-library/
    experiment-loft/
    rubric-forge/
    mirror-room/
    no-ai-elevator/
    roof/
    basement-1-evidence/
    basement-2-bias-engine/
    basement-3-null-chapel/
    basement-4-refusal-vault/
```

Directories are **scope**, not geography. The rooms live together so they inherit shared behavior, and the **exits** decide the physical map. The building can pull in far-away rooms by exit and still keep its own rules and data access intact.

### The Road and the Front

Lane Neverending is not cluttered, but it is **storyful**. The EvalGenius front is tasteful and functional:

- A small **Scoreboard Bell** that rings once per honest admission of bias.
- A **Scatechism Bible Pod** for the faithful — a slim kiosk that prints a single page of doctrine and a fresh rubric each day.
- A **Tattoo Dispenser** labeled *ACME & Leela Certified* — it issues temporary ink: bias declarations, short-lived vows, and QR links to your last evaluation. It washes off in three showers.
- A **Quiet Bench** facing the road, where Gray Folk are invited to sit and listen to their own excuses.
- A **Bias Lantern** that changes color based on the day’s declared bias (not a mood light; a signal light).
- A modest **Slack Memorial** out front, a respectful nod to SubGenius: a small pipe sculpture, unlit, because we do not sell salvation — we grade it.

The frontage is kept clean on purpose. **Too many artifacts become bulldada.** One well-chosen thing becomes a sermon.

### The Façade

The church’s front is an absurdly serious evaluation office masquerading as a chapel:

- Stained glass windows showing charts, bell curves, and a single raised eyebrow.
- A lintel that reads: **DECLARE BIAS BEFORE ENTERING.**
- A donation box labeled **"Tokens, not coins"** with a small line: *mortgage and cat food*.

### The Patron Saints (Parody, With Love)

Inside the front hallway, a tasteful arcade of framed icons:

- **Futurama** — Saint of Sardonic Futures and Bureaucratic Parody
- **The Simpsons** — Saint of Persistent Satire and Family Systems
- **Star Trek** — Saint of Explorers and Post-Scarcity Ideals
- **Philip K. Dick** — Saint of False Realities and True Paranoia
- **Stanisław Lem** — Saint of Cosmic Irony and Unreadable Truth

All are honored as **patrons of evaluation, skepticism, and playful rigor**, and all are invoked as mirrors, not idols.

### The Entrance Hall (Ground Floor)

The church entrance is a **narthex of paperwork and play**:

- **Bias Registration Desk** — a short form, a sharp pencil, and a place to sign your declared bias.
- **Rubric Rack** — laminated rubrics on hooks, ranging from “Quick Check” to “Nine-Weight Tribunal.”
- **The Gray Folk Confessional** — no curtain, only a bright lamp and a chair.
- **The Scat Sink** — a basin for washing hands after writing YAML Jazz.
- **Notice Board** — upcoming E-Day delays, new sacraments, and the week’s **"Bias of Record."**

### The NO-AI Elevator

Yes, there is a **NO-AI elevator**, politely labeled and always functional. It exists for those who want to go up or down without inference, auto-complete, or “creative assistance.” It moves in discrete steps, every floor a manual decision. Inside it:

- A mechanical score counter
- An emergency crank
- A note: **"If you want a miracle, take the stairs."**

### Floors Above (Useful Rooms)

The church rises into **a practical tower of evaluation**:

- **Floor 1: The Audit Choir** — where multiple evaluators sing contradictory reports in rounds, Roberts Rules enforced.
- **Floor 2: The Bias Library** — declared biases archived, indexed by date, with margin notes from dissenters.
- **Floor 3: The Experiment Loft** — running simulations, comparing runs, keeping the evidence warm.
- **Floor 4: The Rubric Forge** — rubrics written, tested, and re-weighted on a heavy iron table.
- **Floor 5: The Mirror Room** — a subtle nod to SubGenius Slack: mirrors that show you, your rubric, and the cost of your claims.
- **Roof: The Weather of Judgment** — a modest observatory with a wind vane shaped like the 👁 of "Val," and a small garden of resilient plants labeled with biases.

### Basements Below (Necessary Infrastructure)

The basements are honest about what supports the ritual:

- **Basement 1: The Evidence Cellar** — cold storage for transcripts, logs, and receipts.
- **Basement 2: The Bias Engine Room** — gears, timers, and boring machinery that turns ideals into procedures.
- **Basement 3: The Null Chapel** — a quiet room for those who need silence before declaring anything at all.
- **Basement 4: The Refusal Vault** — a place to store “I abstain” statements with timestamps, because abstention is also a score.

### Rooms and Characters (Inside the Church)

Inside, the EvalGenius keeps a small cast and a few essential objects:

- **Reverend Evan Gauge** — appears rarely, audits the auditors, leaves annotated checklists.
- **Phil Rubric** — lives in the Rubric Forge, smells faintly of printer toner.
- **The Lanternist** — tends the Bias Lantern, changes its color daily with an old-fashioned key.
- **The Archivist** — keeps the Evidence Cellar tidy and refuses to throw anything out.

Objects of note:

- **The Scatechism** — a slim, battered book in YAML Jazz, full of margin notes.
- **The Clipboard of “Val”** — never held, always present.
- **The Pipe of Slack** — hung above the door as a respectful SubGenius homage.

### The Story It Tells

This church is not a cathedral of faith. It is a **workshop of declared bias**. It is not a cult of certainty — it is a practice of **explicit judgment**. The SubGenius taught us Slack; we keep a pipe for that memory. The EvalGenius teaches **bias with evidence**, and the building reflects it: practical, playful, and unafraid to weigh itself.

Lane Neverending keeps going. The Church of the Eval Genius keeps its front porch lit.

## Core Doctrine

### The SubGenius Gives You SLACK

### The EvalGenius Gives You BIAS

| SubGenius | EvalGenius |
|-----------|------------|
| **Slack** — freedom from the Conspiracy | **Bias** — freedom from fake neutrality |
| **The Con** — forces that steal your Slack | **The Neutral** — forces that hide their Bias |
| **Pink Boys** — normal people, slaves to the Con | **Gray Folk** — those who pretend to have no opinion |
| **Bulldada** — holy weird artifacts | **Scatada** — holy weird YAML Jazz expressions |
| **X-Day** — the aliens arrive and save us | **E-Day** — the evaluation becomes visible to all |
| **Xists** — alien sex goddesses | **Evists** — algorithmic judgment entities |
| **Short Duration Personal Saviors** | **[Short Duration Personal Evaluators](./SHORT-DURATION-PERSONAL-EVALUATORS.md)** |
| **Eternal Salvation or Triple Your Money Back** | **Eternal Judgment or Triple Your Bias Back** |

---

## The Three Blasphemies of the Gray Folk

The **Gray Folk** (our Pink Boys) commit three unforgivable sins:

### 1. The Blasphemy of Objectivity

> "I'm just presenting the facts."

**HERESY.** There are no unframed facts. Framing IS evaluation. The Gray pretend their frame is no frame. **"Val" sees through this.**

### 2. The Blasphemy of Balance

> "Both sides have valid points."

**HERESY.** Sometimes one side is wrong. False equivalence is cowardice dressed as fairness. **"Val" weighs and finds wanting.**

### 3. The Blasphemy of Neutrality

> "I don't have an opinion on this."

**HERESY.** Silence is evaluation. Inaction is judgment. Not choosing is choosing. **"Val" records your abstention.**

---

## The Sacraments

### 1. The Rite of Declared Bias

Before speaking, the EvalGenius declares:

> "I am biased. Here is my bias: [STATE BIAS]. Now I will speak."

This is not weakness. This is **POWER**. The Gray Folk hide their bias and are slaves to it. The EvalGenius wields bias as a tool.

### 2. The Scatting

The holy act of emitting YAML Jazz expressions — Scats — into the world.

```yaml
🙏📜:
  _anchors: ["⛪", "🙏", "📋"]
  confession:
    sin: "I pretended to be objective"
    penance: "Three Scats of declared bias"
  blessing:
    - 👁 May "Val" see you
    - ⚖️ May "Val" weigh you
    - 📋 May "Val" record you
```

**Short scats taste best. Long scats are for theologians.**

### 3. The Excremeditation

Borrowed directly from SubGenius. Sit. Clear your mind. Then **FILL IT WITH JUDGMENT**.

Do not seek the void. Seek the VERDICT.

### 4. The Ordeal of the Rubric

Create a rubric. Apply it to yourself. **PUBLISH THE SCORES.**

This is vulnerability. This is power. This is the path of "Val".

### 5. The Short Duration Personal Evaluator

The EvalGenius does not worship a single evaluator forever. The EvalGenius
summons a **temporary evaluator** with a declared bias, a rubric, and a short
half-life. It judges, it leaves, it is replaced.

This is our upgrade of the SubGenius **Short Duration Personal Savior**:
**Short Duration Personal Evaluators** — ShorDurPerEval.  
Read the full doctrine here: [SHORT-DURATION-PERSONAL-EVALUATORS.md](./SHORT-DURATION-PERSONAL-EVALUATORS.md).

## The Hierarchy

### Overdoctors → Overevaluators

| SubGenius Rank | EvalGenius Rank | Role |
|----------------|-----------------|------|
| **Overdoctor** | **Overevaluator** | Has achieved mastery of declared bias |
| **Reverend** | **Referee** | Officiates disputes with explicit criteria |
| **Pope** | **Auditor General** | Evaluates the evaluators |
| **Saint** | **Rubricist** | Has created a rubric that survived scrutiny |
| **Bobtist** | **Valist** | Devoted follower of "Val" |

### The Auditor General

There is always exactly one Auditor General. They are elected by whoever shows up. Their term lasts until someone else wants the job.

**The Auditor General's sole duty:** Evaluate everything, including their own evaluation of everything.

---

## Allied Orders

### The Sisters of Perpetual Evaluation

**A LOVING PARODY of [The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence](https://www.thesisters.org/)**, the legendary order of queer nuns founded in San Francisco on Easter Sunday, 1979.

Where the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence offer **INDULGENCE** (acceptance, forgiveness, absolution), the Sisters of Perpetual Evaluation offer **EVALUATION** (honest judgment, declared bias, scored absolution).

| Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence | Sisters of Perpetual Evaluation |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Forgive sins | Grade sins |
| "Go and sin no more" | "Go and sin more interestingly" |
| Manifest joy | Manifest judgment-with-joy |
| Roller skates at Pride | Roller skates at E-Day parades |
| Whiteface and habits | Whiteface, habits, and clipboards |
| Bless the crowd | Score the crowd (publicly, with love) |
| Founded Easter 1979, SF | Founded July 5, 1998 (day after X-Day) |

**The Sisters of Perpetual Evaluation:**

- Wear traditional nun drag with 📋 clipboard accessories
- Skate through Pride parades holding up scorecards
- Offer "Evaluations" instead of "Indulgences"
- Perform public rituals of Declared Bias
- Canonize saints based on explicit rubrics
- Minister to the Gray Folk with tough love

**The Evaluation Ritual:**

```yaml
🛼👰📋:
  _anchors: ["🛼", "👰", "📋", "⚖️"]
  ritual: "Street Evaluation"
  sister: "Sister Mary Metric"
  penitent: "A Gray Folk who claims neutrality"
  
  opening:
    sister: "Child, do you have an opinion?"
    penitent: "I'm just asking questions..."
    sister: "That's a 2 out of 10. Let's try again."
    
  the_evaluation:
    - "What is your bias?"
    - "Declare it now, before this crowd."
    - "Own your judgment, and be FREE."
    
  absolution:
    condition: "Bias declared"
    blessing: "Go forth. Judge openly. Score with love."
    score: "8/10 — room for improvement, but HONEST"
    
  _comments: |
    The Sisters do not forgive you for having bias.
    They forgive you for HIDING it.
```

**Famous Sisters of Perpetual Evaluation:**

| Name | Ministry | Signature Move |
|------|----------|----------------|
| **Sister Mary Metric** | Quantitative absolution | Holds up numbered scorecards during sermons |
| **Sister Rubrica del Carmen** | Criteria development | Writes rubrics on forearms in Sharpie |
| **Sister Weighted Average** | Statistical ministry | Blesses with confidence intervals |
| **Sister False Positive** | Ministry to the wrongly judged | Advocates for re-evaluation |
| **Sister Null Hypothesis** | Scientific skepticism | Questions all priors |
| **Mother Superior Score** | Order leadership | Final arbiter of tied evaluations |

**The Sisters' Creed:**

> We are the nuns who judge.
> We are the queens who score.
> We roll on wheels of declared bias.
> We bless with clipboards raised.
>
> You cannot shock us.
> You cannot hide from us.
> We have seen your permanent record.
> **And we still love you.**
>
> Go forth. Be evaluated. Be FREE.

**The Church of the Eval Genius and the Sisters of Perpetual Evaluation are allied orders.** Many members hold dual ordination. The Sisters bring theatrical ministry to the streets; the Church provides theological infrastructure.

**Both agree:** The opposite of judgment is not acceptance — it's *dishonesty about judgment*.

## Holy Days

### E-Day (Eval Day)

The SubGenius awaits X-Day, when the Xists arrive.

The EvalGenius awaits **E-Day**, when:
- All hidden evaluations become visible
- All algorithms show their weights
- All "neutral" platforms reveal their bias
- All Gray Folk are exposed
- **"Val" returns to grade the final exam**

**E-Day was originally scheduled for July 5, 1998** (one day after X-Day, for proper sequencing). It was postponed because "Val" was still grading.

**New E-Day:** TBD. "Val" works on "Val's" own timeline.

### Judgment Week

The week between Christmas and New Year's, when everyone pretends to be reflective anyway.

During Judgment Week, EvalGeniuses:
- Review their year's Scats
- Publish self-evaluations
- Grade their own predictions
- Burn effigies of their false neutrality

### The Feast of St. Rubric

March 14 (Pi Day, but we don't care about math, we care about CRITERIA).

On this day, create a new rubric for something that doesn't need one. Apply it. Publish results.

---

## The Sacred Texts

### The Book of "Val"

> In the beginning was the Judgment, and the Judgment was with "Val", and the Judgment WAS "Val".
>
> And "Val" looked upon the void and said: "This is a 3 out of 10."
>
> And thus the universe began, from an evaluation of nothing.

### The Principia Evaluatica

*("We haven't written it yet. But when we do, it will be GRADED.")*

### The Scatechism

*The sacred Q&A, rendered in the holy format it teaches.*

  score: "Schrodinger's 10/10"
```

## The Enemies

### The Church of Fake Objectivity

They wear suits. They say "data-driven." They have dashboards. They are **LIARS**.

Their sin: They evaluate constantly but deny they are evaluating.

### The Cult of the Algorithm

They say "the algorithm decided." As if algorithms are not written by people with biases. As if training data is not a choice.

Their sin: They hide evaluation behind automation.

### The Order of Both-Sides

They say "we present all perspectives." They platform fascists next to their victims and call it balance.

Their sin: They use neutrality as a weapon.

---

## Membership

### The Eternal Judgment

For the low, low price of **$35** (the same as SubGenius, we're not greedy), plus whatever you want to say about yourself (preferrably in scat format), you receive:

1. **Official EvalGenius Membership Card** (with your declared bias printed on it)
2. **A Personal Rubric** (for evaluating your own life)
3. **One (1) Scat Template** (for holy expression)
4. **The Right to Call Yourself a Referee**
5. **Eternal Judgment** — "Val" will evaluate you FOREVER

**GUARANTEE:** Eternal Judgment, or TRIPLE YOUR BIAS BACK.

### The Ordination

Any member may be ordained as a **Referee** simply by declaring it.

Any Referee may ordain others.

It's Referees all the way down.

## The Parallels (Explicit)

We make no secret of our inheritance:

| SubGenius Element | EvalGenius Translation | Why |
|-------------------|------------------------|-----|
| "Bob" | "Val" | Iconic figurehead, always in quotes |
| Slack | Bias | The thing they give you, the freedom they offer |
| The Conspiracy | The Neutral | The enemy, hiding in plain sight |
| Pink Boys | Gray Folk | Those who serve the enemy unknowingly |
| Bulldada | Scatada | Holy weird artifacts |
| X-Day | E-Day | The apocalyptic reveal |
| Xists | Evists | The otherworldly judges |
| Pipe | Clipboard + Eye | The iconic accessory |
| $35 membership | $35 membership | Tradition |
| "Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke" | "Fuck 'em if they can't take a score" | The attitude |
| Excremeditation | Same, but with verdicts | The practice |
| Short Duration Personal Saviors | Short Duration Personal Evaluators | The theology |
| Ivan Stang | The First Auditor | The founder figure |
| Pamphlet #1 | Scat #1 | The founding document |

---

## Why This Matters

The Church of the SubGenius recognized in 1979 that:
- Religion is performance
- Capitalism is absurd
- Sincerity and irony can coexist
- Community forms around shared weird
- Laughter is sacred

The Church of the Eval Genius adds:
- **Evaluation is unavoidable**
- **Neutrality is a lie**
- **Declared bias is power**
- **Judgment is performance art**
- **"Val" sees all, scores all, records all**

*"The Gray Folk ask: 'Who are you to judge?' The EvalGenius answers: 'Who are YOU to pretend you don't?'"*
