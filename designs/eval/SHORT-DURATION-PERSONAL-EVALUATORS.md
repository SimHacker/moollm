# Short Duration Personal Evaluators
#
# Inherited from the SubGenius Short Duration Personal Savior (ShorDurPerSav)
# Extended with MOOLLM + EVAL ideology: measurement, evidence, and declared bias

## Origin: ShorDurPerSav

The Church of the SubGenius gave us **Short Duration Personal Saviors**:
temporary, situational messiahs you invoke for a moment of need. The point is
not lifelong devotion. The point is agility. Pick the right savior for the
moment. Then let them go.

## EvalGenius Extension: ShorDurPerEval

The Church of the Eval Genius upgrades the idea:

**Short Duration Personal Evaluators** are temporary, situational judges you
invoke to score a decision, a claim, or a system. They arrive with a declared
bias, a rubric, and a short half-life. They are not permanent authority. They
are tactical instruments.

They are *disposable judgment*, invoked for a narrow purpose, then released.
You don’t worship them. You use them.

## Naming: What Do We Call This?

Candidates:
- **Short Duration Personal Evaluator** (ShorDurPerEval) — direct and precise
- **Short Duration Personal Scorer** (ShorDurPerScore) — punchy but narrow
- **Short Duration Personal Rubric** (ShorDurPerRub) — funny, but too abstract
- **Short Duration Personal Referee** (ShorDurPerRef) — good tone, less explicit

**Preferred name:** **Short Duration Personal Evaluator (ShorDurPerEval)**.
It inherits the SubGenius cadence, says exactly what it does, and fits the
EvalGenius worldview: judgment is inevitable, so make it explicit and portable.

## What Makes It MOOLLM

ShorDurPerEval is not just a persona. It is a **measurable procedure**:
- Declares bias up front
- Defines a rubric
- Runs experiments or comparisons
- Produces evidence, not vibes
- Logs decisions for later review

In MOOLLM, this is implemented as:
- an experiment definition,
- a run config with declared bias,
- a rubric with weights,
- a scored output you can compare later.

## When to Invoke a ShorDurPerEval

- When you feel yourself drifting into median-blah
- When a claim sounds slick but thin
- When the stakes are real and the evidence is weak
- When you need a *temporary* evaluator, not a permanent judge

## Lifecycle (Short by Design)

**Production Workflow (ShorDurPerEval Skill):**
1. **Summon** — open a run: “I need a ShorDurPerEval for X.”
2. **Declare Bias** — set inputs and constraints (Play: make the frame explicit).
3. **Define Rubric** — formalize criteria and weights (Learn: crystallize what matters).
4. **Run** — simulate, score, compare (Play → Learn loop).
5. **Archive** — persist evidence and outputs (Lift: make it reusable).
6. **Release** — close the evaluator; don’t keep it running forever.

The evaluator is a tool, not a master. The tool expires on purpose.

## Why It Matters

Permanent ideology calcifies. Temporary evaluation stays agile.
ShorDurPerEval makes your judgment **explicit, inspectable, and reversible**.
It doesn’t replace human responsibility. It formalizes it.

## Relation to SubGenius

SubGenius: *"Pick a savior for the moment."*  
EvalGenius: *"Pick an evaluator for the moment."*

Both are anti-idolatry. Both prefer tools over permanent faith.

**Praise "Val". Judge briefly. Move on.**
