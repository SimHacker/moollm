# The EVAL Brand Family

> *EVAL is to evaluation what SIM was to simulation — a productive morpheme that defines a genre.*

---

## The Core Insight

Just as:
- **SIM** asks: *What happens if...?* (dynamics-first)

**EVAL** asks:
- *What does this mean — and what follows from that?* (interpretation-and-judgment-first)

**EVAL** isn't "more SIM" — it's a new primitive: **evaluation as gameplay**.

## What Makes EVAL Work

The brand works because:

1. **EVAL- behaves like SIM-**: flexible, extensible, legible
2. **It signals mode, not mechanics**: interpretation, not simulation
3. **It's future-proof for LLM-driven systems**: evaluation is what they do
4. **It aligns perfectly with MOOLLM's worldview**: inspectable judgment
5. **It's pedagogical and playful**: learn by judging
6. **It's unmistakably original**: not derivative of any existing brand

## Brand Safety Notes

### Names to Avoid

| Candidate | Risk |
|-----------|------|
| SporEVAL | Too close to "Spore" trademark |
| Eval-X | Too close to "X" platform |
| EvalTwit | Too close to "Twitter" |
| EvalBook | Too close to "Facebook" |
| EvalGram | Too close to "Instagram" |

### Safe High-Concept Names

| Name | Why Safe |
|------|----------|
| **EvalEye** | Original, evocative, no adjacency |
| **EvalAgora** | Historical, civic, clear |
| **EvalMirror** | Thematic, no trademark issues |
| **The Evals** | People-focused, like "The Sims" |

---

## Maxis Parallel (Intentional)

The EVAL family mirrors the SIM family structure:

| Maxis | EVAL |
|-------|------|
| SimCity | EvalCity |
| The Sims | The Evals |
| SimEarth | EVALEarth |
| SimLife | EVALife |
| SimAnt | — |
| Spore | EVALution |

This is **not** trademark infringement — it's a parallel branding grammar that signals the same depth of simulation commitment.

## Final Statement

> *EVAL is the next game genre designing token since SIM.*
>
> *Now with LLMs we can EVALuate instead of SIMply SIMulating.*
