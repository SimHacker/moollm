## Artifacts in MOOLLM

MOOLLM simulations produce **artifacts** — persistent outputs that can be inspected, edited, and evolved.

### The Full Artifact Ecology

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Structure** | Directories, files, indices, links |
| **Narrative** | Session logs, dialogue, stories, essays |
| **Data** | YAML Jazz, configs, registries, caches |
| **Space** | Rooms, maps, zones, paths |
| **Objects** | Furniture, items, tools, vehicles |
| **Beings** | Characters, NPCs, animals, spirits |
| **Collections** | Inventories, libraries, archives |
| **Process** | Logs, transcripts, histories |

Artifacts are **simulation output** — they emerge from play, get dynamically edited, persist across sessions, and serve as input to future simulation.

## This Document: EvalSelf Artifacts

This document focuses on a specific constellation: **artifacts for self-evaluation**.

These are NOT:
- A PDA or productivity app
- A dashboard or metrics tracker
- A todo list or project manager
- External optimization tools

These ARE:
- Instruments for seeing yourself
- Objects that encode evaluative stances
- Familiar forms (diary, map, list) recontextualized
- Part of the **EvalSelf** framework — connecting with the part of you that judges

The EvalSelf artifacts help you externalize judgment, make it inspectable, and build a relationship with your own evaluative processes.

### This Catalog as Prototype Library

These artifact descriptions are **prototypes** — not just documentation.

| Action | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| **Incarnate** | Instantiate an artifact in your world |
| **Personalize** | Adapt it to your context, voice, needs |
| **Simulate** | Run it, interact with it, let it evolve |
| **Evolve** | Watch it grow through use, fork it, merge it |
| **Orchestrate** | Compose artifacts together, build systems |

Your Diary is not THE Diary — it's YOUR Diary, incarnated from this prototype, shaped by your entries, alive in your simulation.

The catalog seeds. You grow.

## What Are EvalSelf Artifacts?

Artifacts are **externalized thinking** — each one encodes a stance toward time, value, and agency.

They are not "features." They are objects you already understand, recontextualized as **evaluative instruments**.

---

## Design Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Not dashboards** | Objects, not metrics |
| **Not coercive** | Optional, revisable |
| **Not hidden** | Inspectable, editable |
| **Not judgmental** | Observational, not punitive |
| **Familiar forms** | Diary, list, map — not custom UI |

---

## Core Reflective Artifacts (Inner Life)

### 📓 Diary

- Session log of lived experience
- Narrative + timestamps
- Interpretive, not factual
- Supports reflection without optimization

**"What happened, as I experienced it."**

### 📜 Wish Book

- Desires without justification
- No feasibility checks
- Wishes ≠ goals
- Wishes are signals, not commitments

**"What I want, without defending it."**

### 🧰 Hope Chest

- Deferred selves
- Paused dreams
- "Not now" identities
- Gentle storage, not abandonment

**"What I'm not ready for, but refuse to discard."**

---

## Direction & Intent

### 🎯 Goal Book / Intentions

**Naming matters.** Avoid "Goal" as coercion.

Better names:
- Intentions
- Trajectories
- Experiments
- Commitments (soft)
- Directions

Structure:
- Proposals, not mandates
- Can expire without failure
- Can be withdrawn with dignity

**"What I'm willing to try next."**

### 🗺️ Map / Catalog

- Conceptual territory, not a plan
- Interests, skills, ideas, places
- No ordering implied

Variants:
- Interest Map
- Value Map
- Skill Constellation
- World Catalog

**"What exists in my world."**

---

## Action Without Moral Weight

### ✅ TODO List (Defanged)

In EVAL, TODOs are:
- Contextual
- Time-bounded
- Non-moralized

**Key rule:** An undone TODO is not a failure, just an observation.

Optional renames:
- Next Small Things
- Possible Actions
- If-Energy-Allows

### 🛒 Shopping List

Brilliantly humble:
- Concrete
- Finite
- Forgiving
- No identity attached

Used for:
- Supplies
- Experiences
- Emotional needs
- Social asks

**"Things that would help."**

### 🛒 Shopping Basket

Present-tense desire:
- Immediate
- Comparative
- Tense
- Charged

The basket is where:
- Indecision lives
- Anxiety spikes
- Projection happens
- Values collide

**"Things I'm considering right now."**

---

## World & Time Artifacts

### 🌍 World Map

Spatial or social:
- Places, platforms, communities
- Who you're connected to
- Where pressure comes from

In The Evals:
- Your social graph
- Visibility zones
- Safe vs risky spaces

**"Where things happen."**

### 📆 Calendar

Calendar ≠ obligation. Calendar = temporal terrain.

In EVAL:
- Events can be tentative
- Time blocks can be labeled "unknown"
- Rest can be scheduled
- Gaps are intentional

**"Where time is already spoken for — and where it isn't."**

### 🧭 Timeline

The anti-scoreboard:
- Narrative ordering
- Causality exploration
- "This led to that"
- No ranking

Supports:
- SpoorEVAL
- Burnout diagnosis
- Pattern recognition
- Biographies and life tracking
- Video timeline synchronization
- Series season, episode, timestamp tracking

**"How I got here."**

---

## Meta-Evaluative Artifacts

### ⚖️ Criteria Ledger

- What standards are currently active
- Where they came from
- Who benefits from them
- When they were adopted

**"By what rules am I judging myself right now?"**

### 🔁 Precedent Book

- Past judgments
- Decisions you regret or affirm
- Patterns you repeat

Prevents:
- Amnesia
- Gaslighting (internal or external)

### 🪞 Mirror Notes

Short reflections on:
- How evaluation felt
- When judgment hurt
- When mercy helped
- Timothy Leary's Mind Mirror
  - evaluations, reflection
  - comparisons, tracking
  - role playing games

**This is the anti-burnout module.**

---

## Social Artifacts (The Evals)

### 💬 Message Threads

- DMs as action surfaces
- Advice, gossip, care
- Power flows through tone

### 🗳️ Suggestion Board

- Player/community proposals
- Voting
- Debate
- Collective pressure

**"What the crowd wants the world to become."**

### 📰 Feed Archive

- What you saw
- What you amplified
- What you ignored

**This is ethical memory.**

---

## Market Artifacts

### 💝 Relationship Catalog

- Social options, not people
- Traits, compatibility, risks
- Not objectification — externalized evaluation

### 🧩 Content Bazaar

- Skills, rituals, buffs, spells, media
- User-created content
- Forkable, remixable

### 📦 Acquisitions Log

- What you chose and why
- History of consumption
- Pattern recognition

---

## Why This System Works

| Quality | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Replaces hidden metrics | With visible objects |
| Makes evaluation optional | Revisable, contextual |
| Supports agency | Without coercion |
| Scales | From inner life to civic |
| Feels familiar | Not clinical |
| Legible | To non-experts |

**And crucially:**
- You can throw artifacts away
- You can ignore them
- You can come back later
- **No artifact is mandatory**

---

## Integration Across EVAL

| **EvalCity** | Institutional artifacts (Policies, Reports) |
| **EvalMarket** | Market artifacts (Basket, Catalog) |
| **SpoorEVAL** | Trace artifacts (Timeline, Precedent Book) |
