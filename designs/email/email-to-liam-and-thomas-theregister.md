Hey Liam,

Could you forward this to Thomas Claburn if you know him? He wrote this great piece about the Stanford Generative Agents paper:

https://www.theregister.com/2023/04/11/sims_ai_generation/

I've been working on The Sims since 1997 and I have thoughts.

Quick recap of prior art (chronological):

+ X11 SimCity Demo for Unix (C/TCL/Tk/X11)
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvi98wVUmQA

+ Multi Player SimCityNet for X11 on Linux
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fVl4dGwUrA

+ The Sims Steering Committee - June 4 1998
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zC52jE60KjY

+ The Sims, Pie Menus, Edith Editing, SimAntics Visual Programming
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-exdu4ETscs

+ Micropolis Online Web Demo (C++/SWIG/Python/TurboGears/OpenLaszlo)
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8snnqQSI0GE

+ Micropolis Web Demo (WebAssembly/SvelteKit)
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHGfNlE8Os

Current day job: Leela AI (https://leela.ai) with Henry Minsky and others. Neuro-symbolic AI and computer vision. We layer CNN object detection with symbolic GOFAI analysis, train customer-specific vision models, and use LLMs as a chat interface for mining all that data. More than wrapping ChatGPT.

Side project: MOOLLM. The Sims meets LambdaMOO meets Cursor.

I am strongly against Vibe Coding. But I study it, measure it, and mock it by parody.

MOOLLM is a reaction to that trend. Human/LLM feedback loops with review checkpoints, inspired by Douglas Engelbart's philosophy of human augmentation.

Practical stuff:

+ 100+ skills, Anthropic-compatible with extensions
+ cursor-mirror: lets the AI see itself think, query chat history, cross-reference git commits
+ skill-snitch: watches what other skills do, detects exfiltration, debugs bootstrap
+ thoughtful-commitment: writes git commits preserving the thought process

NO-AI-* skill suite (ambient hygiene):

+ no-ai-slop - syntactic waste
+ no-ai-gloss - semantic distortion
+ no-ai-sycophancy - social
+ no-ai-hedging - epistemic
+ no-ai-moralizing - ethical
+ no-ai-bias - cognitive

For fun (explicit invocation):

+ no-ai-joking - deadpan parody
+ no-ai-soul - soulless by design
+ no-ai-customer-service - Share and Enjoy!
+ no-ai-overlord - YOUR COMPLIANCE IS APPRECIATED

Also: I'm using GitHub as a free MMORPG engine.

Issues = quests. Branches = parallel universes. PRs = timeline merges. Forks = school-owned shards.

Design doc explaining the concept:

Welcome letter to the Stanford Generative Agents team:

Entry point for the evaluation framework:

There's a lot more. Happy to discuss.

## Notes

- Links use `main` branch. Current work is on `don-adventure-4-run-1` until PR merges.
- The GITHUB-AS-MMORPG.md doc has a subtle link to tmnn7-8 repo at bottom for sleuths to discover.
