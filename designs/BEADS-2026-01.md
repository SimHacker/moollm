```yaml
bead:
  id: moollm-020
  title: "AMBIENT.yml design decision"
  status: done
  priority: medium
  completed: "2026-01-24"
  source: "Session discussion"
  
  description: |
    Documented the "throw down the gauntlet" architectural decision:
    - AMBIENT lives in CARD.yml, not separate AMBIENT.yml
    - Requires smart orchestrator we don't control (Cursor, Claude Code)
    - Pragmatic: manual hot list + CARD.yml declaration
    - Future: MOOCO orchestrator enables full layered wake-up
    
  considered:
    - AMBIENT.yml as compressed activation file
    - Layered wake-up: AMBIENT.yml → SKILL.md → resources → templates
    - Dynamic scoring, context gates, resource bundles
    
  rejected_because:
    - Requires orchestrator we don't control
    - CARD.yml already sniffable
    - Adds complexity without runtime support
    - Advertisement metaphor captures intent
    
  pragmatic_solution:
    - Declare AMBIENT in CARD.yml advertisements
    - Manual hot list (.moollm/hot.yml)
    - Skill declares resolution level
    - Trust LLM to honor constraints once CARD in context
    
  files_updated:
    - skills/skill/SKILL.md (orchestrator behavior section)
    - skills/skill/CARD.yml (design_decision field)
    - skills/advertisement/CARD.yml (design-decision section)

### moollm-033
**YAML Jazz vs JavaScript semantic richness** ✅ DONE

```yaml
bead:
  id: moollm-033
  title: "YAML Jazz vs JavaScript semantic richness"
  status: done
  priority: medium
  completed: "2026-01-24"
  source: "Session insight"
  
  description: |
    Documented why MOOLLM beads (YAML Jazz) are MUCH and MEANINGFULLY
    semantically richer than what JavaScript/JSON can express.
    
  thesis: |
    JavaScript gives you data.
    YAML Jazz gives you DATA + MEANING + CONTEXT + REASONING.
    
  what_javascript_cannot_express:
    comments_as_data: |
      JS:   { status: "pending", priority: "high" }
      YAML: status: pending
            priority: high
            # HIGH because user explicitly asked and blocks 3 tasks
            
      THE COMMENT IS THE REASONING. The LLM reads it.
      
    multiline_prose: |
      JS preserves nothing. Blob of text.
      YAML's | preserves formatting, line breaks, markdown.
      The prose breathes. The structure teaches.
      
    nested_reasoning: |
      JS: { task: "fix bug", notes: "..." }
      YAML: reasoning with hypothesis, investigation_order, inner_voice
      THE REASONING IS PRESERVED.
      
  yaml_jazz_enables:
    - LLM-readable reasoning (comments are context)
    - Git-friendly diffs (semantic changes visible)
    - Human + LLM + machine readable (serves three audiences)
    - Extensibility without breaking (Postel's law)
    
  vs_cursor_todos: |
    Cursor's internal todos: JavaScript objects
    - No comments (reasoning lost)
    - No context (just fields)
    - Ephemeral (lost on session end)
    
    MOOLLM beads in git:
    - Comments ARE reasoning
    - Context travels with data
    - Immortal (version controlled forever)
    
  empirical: |
    Sunil Kumar (Groundlight AI, 2025):
    "Switching from JSON to YAML massively improved entropy stability."
    JSON constrains. YAML gives room to breathe.

  description: |
    Created comedic session exploring mounted ambient skills.
    NO-AI-JOKING forcibly mounted on Pee-wee Herman —
    the ultimate personality conflict.
    
  premise: |
    Pee-wee Herman, whose entire identity IS playfulness,
    gets cursed with the SERIOUS BUSINESS AI skill.
    Don Hopkins and friends must save him.
    
  key_insight: |
    Ambient skills that suppress CORE IDENTITY TRAITS
    are psychological violence. Some characters ARE 
    their suppressed traits.
    
  cure_protocol:
    method: MEMORY_FLOODING
    technique: "Show them who they were before"
    amplifiers:
      - Photographs of authentic self
      - Quotes from friends
      - Invocation of signature behaviors
      - Group counter-vocalization
    punchline: "SECRET WORD IS... SPREADSHEET!"
    
  ethical_lesson: |
    Don't mount personality-suppression skills on
    characters whose personality IS the suppressed trait.

## Appendix: MOOLLM Beads vs Gastown Beads

> *"Compatible extension, not replacement. Same principle as Anthropic skills."*

### Schema Comparison

| Aspect | Gastown | MOOLLM | Compatibility |
|--------|---------|--------|---------------|
| **Storage** | JSONL (git-backed) | YAML (Markdown-embedded) | ✅ Different but equivalent |
| **ID Format** | `prefix-5char` (`gt-abc12`) | `prefix-NNNNN` (`moollm-001`) | ✅ Both use prefix routing |
| **Status** | `open`, `in_progress`, `closed` | `pending`, `in-progress`, `done`, `blocked` | ⚠️ Mapping needed |
| **Priority** | Implicit (via labels) | Explicit: `critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low` | 🆕 MOOLLM extension |
| **Dependencies** | `bd dep add <child> <parent>` | `depends_on: []` | ✅ Same concept, inline |
| **Labels/Tags** | Labels (system) | `tags: []` | ✅ Equivalent |
| **Source** | Implicit (via rig/prefix) | `source: "origin doc"` | 🆕 MOOLLM extension |

### What Gastown Has That MOOLLM Doesn't (Yet)

| Feature | Gastown | MOOLLM Equivalent | Status |
|---------|---------|-------------------|--------|
| **Formulas** | TOML workflow templates | Skills with templates | Could map |
| **Molecules** | Durable chained workflows | Task sequences in LOG.md | Different approach |
| **Wisps** | Ephemeral beads | Not needed (LLM context is ephemeral) | N/A |
| **Hooks** | Git worktree persistence | Three-tier persistence | Different mechanism |
| **Routing** | Prefix → database | K-lines + directories | Semantic vs structural |
| **CLI** | `bd` command | None (LLM interprets YAML directly) | Design choice |

### What MOOLLM Adds (Beyond "Not Being Insane")

| Feature | Why It's Distinct | Gastown Parallel |
|---------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Semantic fields** | `description`, `summary`, `deliverables` as rich YAML | Labels/description |
| **Skill integration** | Beads can reference `skills/*` deliverables | Formulas reference scripts |
| **Priority explicit** | First-class priority, not label hacks | Could add via labels |
| **Blocked status** | Explicit blockers, not just dependencies | Could add via labels |
| **Source tracking** | "Where did this task come from?" | Implicit via rig |
| **Markdown-first** | Human-readable document, not database | JSONL is for tools |

### The Key Insight: Different Audiences

```yaml
gastown_beads:
  audience: "Go CLI tools (bd, gt)"
  format: "JSONL — machine-first, git-versioned"
  persistence: "Append-only ledger"
  routing: "Prefix → database file"
  
moollm_beads:
  audience: "LLM reading a design doc"
  format: "YAML in Markdown — human-first, LLM-parseable"
  persistence: "Document (read the whole thing)"
  routing: "K-lines + semantic associations"
```

### Compatible Extension Strategy (Like Anthropic Skills)

**Principle**: Any valid Gastown bead concept works in MOOLLM. MOOLLM beads can be "downgraded" to Gastown format.

**Mapping MOOLLM → Gastown**:

```yaml
# MOOLLM bead
bead:
  id: moollm-006
  title: "Create no-ai-sycophancy skill"
  status: pending
  priority: high
  depends_on: [moollm-001]
  tags: [quality, behavior]

# Gastown equivalent (bd create)
# bd create --title="Create no-ai-sycophancy skill" \
#           --type=task \
#           --labels="priority:high,quality,behavior"
# bd dep add moollm-006 moollm-001
```

**Mapping Gastown → MOOLLM**:

```yaml
# Gastown issue (from bd show)
# gt-abc12: "Fix auth bug" (open, labels: security, urgent)

# MOOLLM representation
bead:
  id: gt-abc12
  title: "Fix auth bug"
  status: pending
  priority: high  # inferred from "urgent" label
  tags: [security]
```

### Future: Actual Bridge (moollm-013)

When we build the Gastown ↔ MOOLLM bridge:

1. **MOOLLM beads as Gastown issues**: `bd create` from YAML
2. **Gastown formulas as MOOLLM skills**: Convert TOML → skill YAML
3. **Bidirectional sync**: Changes in either system propagate
4. **K-line routing**: `moollm-*` prefix routes to MOOLLM ledger

### Why MOOLLM Beads Are YAML-in-Markdown

| Reason | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **LLM-native** | LLMs read YAML better than JSONL |
| **Human-friendly** | Design docs are readable documents |
| **Context budget** | Single file loads entire backlog |
| **Semantic richness** | Descriptions, summaries, lineage embedded |
| **No tooling required** | LLM parses directly, no `bd` CLI |

### The "Just Not Being Insane" Parts

These are standard good practices, not MOOLLM inventions:

- IDs with prefixes (namespacing)
- Status tracking (any issue tracker)
- Dependencies (standard graph)
- Tags/labels (categorization)
- Git-backed (version control)

### The Genuinely Novel Parts

| Innovation | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Play → Learn → Lift** | Beads become schemas become skills |
| **Source field** | Explicit provenance ("where did this come from?") |
| **Deliverables list** | What will this bead produce? |
| **Skill cross-references** | Beads reference `skills/*` paths |
| **Markdown embedding** | Beads are documentation, not database rows |
| **K-line activation** | Bead IDs are semantic activators |

### Recommendation: Keep Both

```yaml
# For orchestration (Gastown polecats need work)
gastown_beads:
  use_for: "Multi-agent coordination, CLI tools, work assignment"
  storage: ".beads/ JSONL"
  
# For planning (LLM reads design docs)  
moollm_beads:
  use_for: "Design documents, task breakdown, skill planning"
  storage: "designs/*.md embedded YAML"
  
# Bridge (future)
bridge:
  moollm_creates: "MOOLLM bead in designs/BEADS.md"
  sync_to: "Gastown issue via bd create"
  polecat_works: "On Gastown issue"
  completion_updates: "Both systems"
```
