### moollm-020
**AMBIENT.yml design decision** ✅ DONE

```yaml
bead:
  id: moollm-020
  title: "AMBIENT.yml design decision"
  status: done
  priority: medium
  completed: "2026-01-24"
  source: "Session discussion"
  
  description: |
    Documented the "throw down the gauntlet" architectural decision:
    - AMBIENT lives in CARD.yml, not separate AMBIENT.yml
    - Requires smart orchestrator we don't control (Cursor, Claude Code)
    - Pragmatic: manual hot list + CARD.yml declaration
    - Future: MOOCO orchestrator enables full layered wake-up
    
  considered:
    - AMBIENT.yml as compressed activation file
    - Layered wake-up: AMBIENT.yml → SKILL.md → resources → templates
    - Dynamic scoring, context gates, resource bundles
    
  rejected_because:
    - Requires orchestrator we don't control
    - CARD.yml already sniffable
    - Adds complexity without runtime support
    - Advertisement metaphor captures intent
    
  pragmatic_solution:
    - Declare AMBIENT in CARD.yml advertisements
    - Manual hot list (.moollm/hot.yml)
    - Skill declares resolution level
    - Trust LLM to honor constraints once CARD in context
    
  files_updated:
    - skills/skill/SKILL.md (orchestrator behavior section)
    - skills/skill/CARD.yml (design_decision field)
    - skills/advertisement/CARD.yml (design-decision section)

### moollm-024
**Directories as Interests documentation** ✅ DONE

```yaml
bead:
  id: moollm-024
  title: "Directories as Interests documentation"
  status: done
  priority: medium
  completed: "2026-01-24"
  source: "Session discussion"
  
  description: |
    Documented the foundational principle:
    - Directory listings ARE virtual interests for the LLM
    - Filenames are LLM-recognizable K-lines
    - Big-endian naming (most significant first)
    - ls output IS the semantic index
    - Directories are expandable outlines
    
  key_concept: |
    When an LLM lists a directory, good filenames activate
    semantic understanding BEFORE the file is opened.
    The filename IS a K-line.
    
  big_endian_naming: |
    ✓ 2026-01-24-description.yml   (date first)
    ✗ description-2026-01-24.yml   (buried)
    
    ✓ RUN-001-name.yml             (sequence first)
    ✗ name-run-001.yml             (buried)
    
  files_updated:
    - kernel/NAMING.yml (directories_as_interests section)
    - skills/yaml-jazz/CARD.yml (directories_as_interests)
    - skills/skill/CARD.yml (directories_as_interests)
    - skills/no-ai-gloss/examples/INDEX.yml

### moollm-023
**Self-correction protocol for no-ai-* skills** ✅ DONE

```yaml

  title: "Self-correction protocol for no-ai-* skills"
  status: done
  priority: medium
  completed: "2026-01-24"
  source: "Session discussion"
  
  description: |
    Skills that catch violations should LOG them as examples:
    1. CATCH — User or LLM notices violation
    2. ANALYZE — What sin? Why wrong?
    3. ADMIT — "I used euphemism because..."
    4. CORRECT — "I should have said..."
    5. LOG — Write to examples/{timestamp}-{name}.yml
    6. LEARN — Skill gets smarter
    
  key_insight: |
    Directory listing IS the semantic index.
    Filenames are LLM-recognizable training data.
    Users can PR their examples!
    
  filename_convention: |
    {YYYY-MM-DD}-{descriptive-iconic-name}.yml
    e.g., 2026-01-24-mafia-tribute-relationship-management.yml

### moollm-022
**Smart vs Dumb orchestrator documentation** ✅ DONE

```yaml
bead:
  id: moollm-022
  title: "Smart vs Dumb orchestrator documentation"
  status: done
  priority: medium
  completed: "2026-01-24"
  source: "Session discussion"
  
  description: |
    Documented the "invisible orchestration" architecture:
    - Standard CARD.yml schema enables programmatic parsing
    - Smart orchestrators (MOOCO) parse ads, inject invisibly
    - Dumb orchestrators (Cursor) fall back to advisory mode
    - Same CARD.yml works in both — mechanism adapts
    
  key_insight: |
    The custom driver says to the LLM:

### Schema Comparison

| Aspect | Gastown | MOOLLM | Compatibility |
|--------|---------|--------|---------------|
| **Storage** | JSONL (git-backed) | YAML (Markdown-embedded) | ✅ Different but equivalent |
| **ID Format** | `prefix-5char` (`gt-abc12`) | `prefix-NNNNN` (`moollm-001`) | ✅ Both use prefix routing |
| **Status** | `open`, `in_progress`, `closed` | `pending`, `in-progress`, `done`, `blocked` | ⚠️ Mapping needed |
| **Priority** | Implicit (via labels) | Explicit: `critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low` | 🆕 MOOLLM extension |
| **Dependencies** | `bd dep add <child> <parent>` | `depends_on: []` | ✅ Same concept, inline |
| **Labels/Tags** | Labels (system) | `tags: []` | ✅ Equivalent |
| **Source** | Implicit (via rig/prefix) | `source: "origin doc"` | 🆕 MOOLLM extension |

### What Gastown Has That MOOLLM Doesn't (Yet)

| Feature | Gastown | MOOLLM Equivalent | Status |
|---------|---------|-------------------|--------|
| **Formulas** | TOML workflow templates | Skills with templates | Could map |
| **Molecules** | Durable chained workflows | Task sequences in LOG.md | Different approach |
| **Wisps** | Ephemeral beads | Not needed (LLM context is ephemeral) | N/A |
| **Hooks** | Git worktree persistence | Three-tier persistence | Different mechanism |
| **Routing** | Prefix → database | K-lines + directories | Semantic vs structural |
| **CLI** | `bd` command | None (LLM interprets YAML directly) | Design choice |

### What MOOLLM Adds (Beyond "Not Being Insane")

| Feature | Why It's Distinct | Gastown Parallel |
|---------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Semantic fields** | `description`, `summary`, `deliverables` as rich YAML | Labels/description |
| **Skill integration** | Beads can reference `skills/*` deliverables | Formulas reference scripts |
| **Priority explicit** | First-class priority, not label hacks | Could add via labels |
| **Blocked status** | Explicit blockers, not just dependencies | Could add via labels |
| **Source tracking** | "Where did this task come from?" | Implicit via rig |
| **Markdown-first** | Human-readable document, not database | JSONL is for tools |

### The Key Insight: Different Audiences

```yaml
gastown_beads:
  audience: "Go CLI tools (bd, gt)"
  format: "JSONL — machine-first, git-versioned"
  persistence: "Append-only ledger"
  routing: "Prefix → database file"
  
moollm_beads:
  audience: "LLM reading a design doc"
  format: "YAML in Markdown — human-first, LLM-parseable"
  persistence: "Document (read the whole thing)"
  routing: "K-lines + semantic associations"
```

### Compatible Extension Strategy (Like Anthropic Skills)

**Principle**: Any valid Gastown bead concept works in MOOLLM. MOOLLM beads can be "downgraded" to Gastown format.

**Mapping MOOLLM → Gastown**:

```yaml
# MOOLLM bead
bead:
  id: moollm-006
  title: "Create no-ai-sycophancy skill"
  status: pending
  priority: high
  depends_on: [moollm-001]
  tags: [quality, behavior]

# Gastown equivalent (bd create)
# bd create --title="Create no-ai-sycophancy skill" \
#           --type=task \
#           --labels="priority:high,quality,behavior"
# bd dep add moollm-006 moollm-001
```

**Mapping Gastown → MOOLLM**:

```yaml
# Gastown issue (from bd show)
# gt-abc12: "Fix auth bug" (open, labels: security, urgent)

# MOOLLM representation
bead:
  id: gt-abc12
  title: "Fix auth bug"
  status: pending
  priority: high  # inferred from "urgent" label
  tags: [security]
```

### Future: Actual Bridge (moollm-013)

When we build the Gastown ↔ MOOLLM bridge:

1. **MOOLLM beads as Gastown issues**: `bd create` from YAML
2. **Gastown formulas as MOOLLM skills**: Convert TOML → skill YAML
3. **Bidirectional sync**: Changes in either system propagate
4. **K-line routing**: `moollm-*` prefix routes to MOOLLM ledger

### Why MOOLLM Beads Are YAML-in-Markdown

| Reason | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **LLM-native** | LLMs read YAML better than JSONL |
| **Human-friendly** | Design docs are readable documents |
| **Context budget** | Single file loads entire backlog |
| **Semantic richness** | Descriptions, summaries, lineage embedded |
| **No tooling required** | LLM parses directly, no `bd` CLI |

### The "Just Not Being Insane" Parts

These are standard good practices, not MOOLLM inventions:

- IDs with prefixes (namespacing)
- Status tracking (any issue tracker)
- Dependencies (standard graph)
- Tags/labels (categorization)
- Git-backed (version control)

### The Genuinely Novel Parts

| Innovation | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Play → Learn → Lift** | Beads become schemas become skills |
| **Source field** | Explicit provenance ("where did this come from?") |
| **Deliverables list** | What will this bead produce? |
| **Skill cross-references** | Beads reference `skills/*` paths |
| **Markdown embedding** | Beads are documentation, not database rows |
| **K-line activation** | Bead IDs are semantic activators |

### Recommendation: Keep Both

```yaml
# For orchestration (Gastown polecats need work)
gastown_beads:
  use_for: "Multi-agent coordination, CLI tools, work assignment"
  storage: ".beads/ JSONL"
  
# For planning (LLM reads design docs)  
moollm_beads:
  use_for: "Design documents, task breakdown, skill planning"
  storage: "designs/*.md embedded YAML"
  
# Bridge (future)
bridge:
  moollm_creates: "MOOLLM bead in designs/BEADS.md"
  sync_to: "Gastown issue via bd create"
  polecat_works: "On Gastown issue"
  completion_updates: "Both systems"
```
