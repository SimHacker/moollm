I want to go more public with talking about moollm. I have made a few mentions and links on hn but not gotten much traction, and had the expected knee jerk "oh that's ai slop" from people who didn't even read it and automatically reject anything ai generated. That is missing the point that moollm is itself all about ai generation, self reflection, self-improvement by iterative generation and reflection and refinement, and that I carefully review everything generated and edit it with a fine tooth comb relentlessly so this is WAY on the opposite end of the spectrum of vibe coding and the whole point is to elminiate ai slop and much worse things like ai gloss and the other things that the NO-AI suite of skills address. Of course I'm using llms to help me write text. I don't type in a short prompt and let it think for me. You can see by my consistent posting history on hacker news that I have no problem writing enormous original walls of detailed text about many topics I am obsessed with (I think the kids call it info dumping these days), and I need the llm to help cut it down, deduplicate it, organize it, categorize it, focus it, here I go again -- bla bla bla. So don't complain about well organized concise text being ai generataed if the alternative is DON-SLOP! 
So step one is to write a medium post, VERY MUCH in my voice and NO-AI-SLOP and NO-AI-GLOSS and NO-AI-SYNCHOPHANCY and definitily not NO-AI-HYPE - the ideas here are historically and scientifically grounded. I have a track record of evangelizing and explaining many different thing I think are important. The Church of the Subgenius defines "Short Duration Personal Savior". I have many of  those and love to share what I find fascinating and interrelateed about them. I'm having fun making something that it's fine if nobody wants. In some ways it's the opposite of Gas City on many levels. But I am doing it in the open and inviting people to take a look and play with it and particiate and contribute. I don't have a lot of time to run an online community, I want to concentrate on building moollm, but I am happy to email and chat and make videos about it, or more when I have the time. But promoting it is not my ultimate goal or desired time sync. So I use it to promote itself, since it's better than me at writing concisely and organized, given the right context to guide it, which moollm aims to be. So the first task would be to write a medium post

I wasted a lot of my life being too scared to make something out of fear. This community especially can be very toxic to people that are starting out, that aren't geniuses, that didnt make every perfect decision for their product.
Life is more enjoyable in a create-fail-learn loop than a consume-criticize-gloat loop.

I wish I'd learned that sooner.


	
davnicwil on Sept 23, 2023 | parent | next [–]

A negative reception to putting a product out there is actually a really great outcome. It shows you are doing something right if this happens.
The expected and typical outcome is to be completely ignored - crickets. This is perhaps the main reason you should not fear shipping!

I have a post which elaborates on this if it's interesting for anyone: https://davnicwil.com/negative-feedback-is-positive/


	
keiferski on Sept 23, 2023 | root | parent | next [–]

Unfortunately those two things often come together, in which the only bit of attention is a single negative comment. Social media sites (forums included) are optimized to reward criticism, no matter how small, instead of positivity.
Supposedly this is because upvotes are intended to replace comments like "Great!" or "I really like this, good job." But obviously that doesn't work out in reality.


	
version_five on Sept 24, 2023 | root | parent | next [–]

I see this on HN frequently. Someone posts their thing and you get some low quality banter about the name choice or hosting provider or whatever, and then the top thread is a big unsubstantiated criticism plus some pilers on. You never really know what to make of it but it feels pretty much the same as if the post was just ignored.

	
GMoromisato on Sept 23, 2023 | root | parent | prev | next [–]

I agree with you—particularly about shipping.
I used to worry about shipping because I thought “you only get one chance to make a good impression.”

But as long as you use negative feedback to improve, you will always[1] get another chance! Statistically speaking, 0% of the world has seen your product.

[1] Obligatory disclaimer that if you really fuck up, you don’t get another chance. But that’s super rare.


	
SoftTalker on Sept 23, 2023 | root | parent | next [–]

Yes, I think if someone cares enough to leave negative feedback, they found it interesting enough to at least try it out, and they're (often) at least invested enough to see if their feedback has any impact or makes a difference. They will look again.
The people who see your thing as useless and don't even try it are the people you never hear from.


	
chaos_emergent on Sept 23, 2023 | root | parent | prev | next [–]

I totally agree with negative reception! It means that people give enough of a shit to feel about your product. Which means that with more development - either in product or in market - you’ll find people who love what you made.

	
paulryanrogers on Sept 23, 2023 | root | parent | prev | next [–]

Negative feedback is a signal, yet not a guaranteed good. It could also just mean someone stumbled into your product and found it fatally flawed. Sometimes one needs to hear hard things.
Then again when building only for myself all feedback (or lack thereof) is irrelevant!

> This community especially can be very toxic to people that are starting out, that aren't geniuses
The toxic ones are especially cruel to people that have special genius.

And the toxic ones usually consider themselves the deep well of genius. Anything that threatens that perception incurs ire.

You can find this in places where there is a, "pecking order" and someone who comes along with a new inspiration gets beat down viciously.


	
AlbertCory on Sept 23, 2023 | root | parent | next [–]

"Consider the source" is always good advice.
In interpersonal life, you have more to go on about the source. He or she is obviously an opinionated know-nothing loudmouth. Online, you either have to know the sender, or guess from the community.

StackExchange is especially infested with those, so you can safely assume anyone trashing your idea is one of them. Reddit, too, pretty much. HN has some of those, but not everyone is like that.


	
csydas on Sept 23, 2023 | root | parent | prev | next [–]

I can understand how this conclusion is reached, but I would position that it's less about the specific skill in any given subject and more just about a person's own perception of what is and is not appropriate for interpersonal actions. I know a lot of incredibly smart and gifted people in the programming sphere who are the most gregarious and kind persons you might ever meet, ready to help on just about any problem they're able to -- I've also met the types you're mentioning, and I'm not sure that their way of handling themselves is a requirement or even characteristic for such genius.
Bumping into such personalities when it comes to their subject matter of expertise might be a challenge, sure. They are sure of themselves, direct to a fault, and it takes a lot to get them to reconsider their point of view or even explain it sometimes as they tend to get pretty dogmatic about it. It can be tempting to associate this with their skill level in the subject matter, but I see the same boisterous bravado from the C-levels and VPs when they decide there is something they _must_ opine on without having any knowledge in the domain.

In my experiences, those who just react "screw you guys I'm going home" when challenged aren't quite the superstars they present themselves as; the real superstars are far more open to their ideas being challenged because, in my experience again, they _like_ that sort of challenge. It's not earth shattering for their ego to be corrected, it's a moment of embarrassment, then a moment of appreciation as their mental model adjust and they begin to realize how many axioms they've held based of their previously incorrect logic begin to change/drop away, and they are unburdened by this correction, not harmed.

That is to say, I'm not sure that it's at all related to the skill level or special geniuses, it's just too easy to fall into a perception for oneself of "smart people are always right and when someone challenges them, the only correct path is to assert dominance above all else"; I don't think you need to tie such behavior to any particular industry or skillset, I can guarantee you that this happens in virtually all spheres.

With regards to the article, I think the author maybe has the start of a well developed idea that is marred by trying to associate it with success in the tech world; Steve Jobs may have bucked trends in the industry by going all-in on a nascent technology which ended up making Apple the household name for smartphones; I don't think it was out of any particular inspiration except that "this is coming anyways, and it's gonna make us a shitload of money"; Jobs might have known when he was wrong, but from the stories available, doesn't seem he was often humble about it.

But I would propose don't associate that kind of toxicity with the field; there are a lot of things that encourage such behavior, sure, but I think a lot of this is just the same outdated/ineffective ideas of leadership and decision making that have plagued the world for some time -- it's quite fast to see that this is in just about any community that gets big enough, and it's not exactly a game we _have_ to play, it's just one we continue to play for whatever reason...†

† Addendum: This is not to speak of workplace hierarchies and the ridiculousness that is the structure of a Corporation. From personal experience, such hierarchical power is absolutely a farce, the same in my mind as a pyramid scheme. My reasoning for this is that despite my very fancy title and rapid rise to this title, I know that the title is only useful so long as the person I'm talking with is willing to give it power. My colleagues will absolutely "go over my head" instead of discussing items with me if they don't get the answer they like right away, and our clients will do the same. I think the sooner we can do away with such stringent and pointless hierarchies the better, as it's hard for me to see them as anything but a show to allow the people with real power in such hierarchies to get their way.


	
barrysteve on Sept 23, 2023 | root | parent | next [–]

Steve had the kind of ego-less pride that has existed in the US since time immemorial. He pushed his image much more than normal, though.
The power in heirarchies, is not the title, but the relationships between 'brothers' inside it.

Titles are closer to recognition of your 'mission' or 'role' in the organization.

Being part of a heirarchy in name only, being part of a heirarchy only for the title, is a slippery slope downwards.

Commitment to dogma, commitment to the mission, has no direct relation to competence. It can help, it can hinder, the person's ability matters more.


	
csydas on Sept 23, 2023 | root | parent | next [–]

> The power in heirarchies, is not the title, but the relationships between 'brothers' inside it.
I would disagree to an extent -- for those in the brotherhood, yes it's about the relationships; for the rest, it's about the title(s). The hierarchy exists as an exclusionary barrier ensuring those outside it respect the hierarchy, while those inside play with the hierarchy of the brotherhood.

From my experiences across many businesses, this is an accurate representation of hierarchy and titles; they are a tool of force against those without the title, except for those who are close with someone else within the hierarchy who is willing to forgo the hierarchy and mission/purpose of the org. It's wildly inconsistent, prone to errors and really bad decision making, and it's quite hard to unravel for virtually anyone who wants another way of doing things.


	
barrysteve on Sept 23, 2023 | root | parent | next [–]

Businesses and corporations need a heirarchy to withhold knowledge and information from outsiders and 'insiders hungry enough to be dangerous'.
But the natural state for a heirarchy is in an institution, or a military, or a government.

As soon as you make money, your final measure of existence, heirarchy is crippled (to varying degrees) as a concept.

Heirarchy in a business is nearly identical as keeping people 'on a shelf' ready to be deployed onto the storm and stress of work. Businesses heirarchies are flatter, often chaotic and lose rigour and discipline, anytime someone sees financial benefit in bending the rules.

A pure heirachy like something seen on a british navy frigate, or in a religious instution, is a better mental model for the concept. Business needs, flatten out what the ideal concept is capable of producing.


	
csydas on Sept 23, 2023 | root | parent | next [–]

i get what you’re saying, but i don’t see those as true hierarchies either. they suffer the same issues and problems as described above.
the simple idea of implicit authority because of rank or position does not seem to work as soon as there is an incentive to misuse it; i don’t know what the answer is to this but i don’t really subscribe that the majority of the hierarchies matter so much.

the open source model of “just fork it if you don’t agree” isn’t great, but i would say it’s a start. maintainers define the goal and purpose of the project, but if you don’t like the rules, fork and go your separate ways. this is vastly simplified of course, but i think it better represents a model that would be reasonable for a hierarchy.

>This community especially
Most communities have that though; they don't like others having success, they don't like talent/genius in others, they laugh at failure (both by large and small companies) etc. Really one of the best lessons in life (often learned at a higher age) is to give two shits about what anyone thinks about whatever you do.

Just building stuff (fail/success doesn't matter so much) is more than by far most will ever do; they are mostly jealous of people who get anything done at all.

barrysteve on Sept 23, 2023 | parent | prev | next [–]

I'd like to point out the opposite.
I made a game with a group of well educated friends back in the mid 2000s. It was released (against agreements) when the core gameplay was roughly-in place, but all the art assets were 'programmer art'.

It made the top ten worst Steam Greenlight games (on some dead blog) and attracted huge quantities of negative criticism.

Even though it was never linked to my public reputation and I found it hilarious at the time...

It did make me very hesistant and perfectionist in future projects and took out a certain amount of faith that 'it will work out'.

I learnt a lot from the experience and I'm glad I did it. But gosh I wasted a lot of good juice and youthful exuberance on that.

Failure is not 'free'.


	
anonzzzies on Sept 23, 2023 | root | parent | next [–]

> It did make me very hesistant and perfectionist in future projects and took out a certain amount of faith that 'it will work out'.
But that's because you still cared about others. And maybe didn't read enough startup/entrepreneur books or know enough people who did that. Once you know what crap companies willingly release which go on to be successful, it will make you far less perfectionist.

I had the luck of having a few family members in computing in the 70s when I was born, so I heard early on about Allen debugging/fixing the basic interpreter he wrote on a PDP for a processor he didn't have access to at the time on the plane for one of the most important meetings of Microsoft at the time. The absolute and total garbage Oracle released for many years when they started. etc. And those are old stories, but this happens all the time; a lot of products that are launched by big or small companies are so full of bugs that I wonder sometimes if anyone bothered to try them.

I simply stopped caring about perfection as it drove me insane and no-one cares anyway. Even, in line with this article, even if I make something ONLY for myself, I rather just finish it and then change it over time then try to get it in a 'perfect state' from the start. It doesn't make me happy as perfection is not really something that's easy to define; especially in software, it is so incredibly hard to get to anything better than 'ok', that striving for perfection (Dijkstra like) will drive you completely bonkers and nothing ever gets released.

> This community especially can be very toxic to people that are starting out
This isn’t toxicity. This is normal human behaviour. Either you deal with it yourself internally or you will be suffering it forever.

Maybe this is why childhood trauma helps sometimes at being an entrepreneur (I have first hand experience), being bullied made sure I didn’t really care about negative feedback later on in life.

My point is calling it toxic doesn’t help. It doesn’t help you, because you place your own self worth in someone else’s hands. This is bad. Secondly, you’ll never change this, because it’s normal. People don’t like new things, except for a few exceptions. You have to build something really cool or people won’t care. Society just isn’t some 100% love, accepting place. Sorry. Evolution didn’t make it that way. Society doesn’t have an obligation to you to be nice.

But that’s the whole point of this article too. Just build stuff you enjoy. Who cares what others think? Stop blaming society for your issues.

This is something college is good for, FWIW. Everyone is expected to be young and inexperienced and it's set up to build experience at a reasonable pace, with supportive external validation.

Start through another community then? It is nobody's fault if you can't impress people. But I find people being very welcoming here to bad ideas and half-baked products that are absolutely low quality and soon gets abandoned.

Caring about your work and work environment can make time spent working a lot more fulfilling. Which isn't to say every company or every manager inspires such sentiment, but if you can find a way to care about your work, and/or find work that you care about, it's definitely more pleasant than just doing the minimum to collect pay.

	
sentimentscan on Sept 23, 2023 | root | parent | next [–]

Nothing is worse then when you care, and apparently all the code written/test/work done 3 months by team goes straight to the trash, no explanation. Simply some exec in this large thought that it should go to trash, couldn't even give me a reason. I quickly quit after that.

	
IggleSniggle on Sept 23, 2023 | root | parent | next [–]

Believe me, it's far worse when everybody working on it thinks it should go in the trash, but everybody is still working on it because some exec in this large org thinks it still has promise year after year.
I've been on both sides of that, and while I appreciate execs that know how to give a project room to breath and find their footing, I also appreciate execs that know when to tear the bandaid off.

If he can spend time at work doing things he likes to do then why not? He could have spent that time churning out features instead, but now he got to clean up a codebase, some people like doing that sort of thing.

I can imagine caring about something like that if it was impending something important (say, it was about developing software that is part of court system/curing cancer/doing something that I consider personally important).
Or they are paid specifically for that, or they just spend they work hours on that.

Hopefully they are not spending unpaid overtime on that (unless they consciously volunteer to help with something important, not with widget marketing)


	
Aeolun on Sept 23, 2023 | root | parent | next [–]

Dear god, no. I’m paid for it.

It still feels like nobody (except my boss) wants what I’m selling.

Which isn’t exactly true either, but people certainly do not embrace change.

Maybe I've been exceptionally lucky (although I've been very conscious to only work for SMEs which I think has a lot to do with it), but I always try really hard to figure out what the user/customer is actually trying to achieve, then what's the best way to get there using the resources available, regardless of any incumbent processes or strategy. To my mind this is the best of both worlds - I've got the satisfaction of making something great and the customer gets their life made easier.
As I've gone through my career I've focused less and less on some specific language or technology stack that is the flavour of the day, and I get my satisfaction from engineering a robust solution from whatever is the must appropriate technology in that specific case.

This article resonated with me a lot and had me reflecting on my journey writing komorebi.
I started writing komorebi because I had recently migrated to Windows and was really struggling without a tiling window manager. I didn't know anything about Win32 APIs when I started, or much about Rust either, actually.

Fast forward to today, and komorebi is sitting at 35k downloads, supported by a huge Discord server, a vibrant community, and hundreds of people watching me develop it on YouTube.

I created some incredibly important and impactful systems at $dayjob some years before I started komorebi. It was at a real low point in my life where I was struggling with depression, and I still _feel_ that when I look at the codebases and interact with those systems today. I wonder if others do, too. In some ways, I'm glad that those codebases and those systems are not public for others to see for that reason.

I am however, very glad that komorebi is out for the public to see, because I built it in a place of joy, hope and serenity, and I believe that those feelings are there to be seen in both the codebase and the product.


	
IggleSniggle on Sept 23, 2023 | parent | next [–]

I really like your interpretation of psychology on resultant codebases. Personally, I have very mild bipolar-like tendencies, and I find that I don't really get much done except in my "manic" phases. If I'm feeling more charitable to myself I call it an explore/exploit loop. I consider it one of life's many seasons, and don't mind the oscillations too much.
However, while I've read serene code, my own code often reads as "manic" in my own estimation.

I haven't found the state of mind where I would even attempt serene code: when I'm at peace, writing code seems like a waste of time when there's trees and bubbling waters outside, and good friends and family to share gentle laughs with. I genuinely enjoy coding, but I would like it if I could find that serene mental space that also afforded productivity.


	
iFreilicht on Sept 25, 2023 | root | parent | next [–]

Oh that's interesting! I've been experiencing a similar thing recently. If I'm satisfied with life, there's not much drive to code, it feels like it's just going to disturb my peace. But when I'm feeling like stuff just isn't good enough and something must be done, "doing something" means writing code, either until I'm satisfied or until I'm tired. Sometimes the codebases in my day job don't satisfy, so I contribute to open source instead, as that feels more impactful and permanent.
I wonder how many projects came into existence just because someone was unhappy with the way things were and the only thing they could do that felt impactful was programming.


	
jpcapdevila on Sept 23, 2023 | parent | prev | next [–]

I think what you have experienced is very real. Code (and most forms of expression) are a way to externalize your state of mind.
I've seen it with my own emotional states but also with coworkers when they are going trough a rough time.

This is also why it is difficult to understand others ppl code. And it gets easier as you build a relation/get to know them better. The better you know someone, the easier and faster you can understand their code.

I feel like that is why coding standards, code reviews etc make a codebase more maintainable. You strip the code emotions away or at least reset it to a common level across the team.


	
julianeon on Sept 23, 2023 | parent | prev | next [–]

Nice work!
One reason why I went 100% Linux was because I couldn't find a window manager equivalent elsewhere that was anywhere close to i3. And yours, to me, looks competitive with i3.

The window manager has been the one killer feature that was just not available at the same level on MacOS or Windows. It's nice to see that changing.

The Church of the Subgenius has the concept of the "Short Duration Personal Savior" (ShorDurPerSav):

I've seen people on hn describe themselves as "serial specialists". (However, nobody admits to being a "parallel generalist".)

https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22337342

>I'm a generalist too, or as someone else put it - a serial specialist. You could just stagnate until you retire. That's basically what I'm doing, but for slightly different reasons.

https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22335697

>Something i learned about myself a little bit farther in was that I wasn’t a generalist so much as I was a serial specialist (once you haven’t touched something you used the be good at for seven years, can you still claim to be good at it? Turns out I can’t).

https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4317080

>Going for knowledge just because it sounds cool isn't going to be a motivator strong enough for success. Find stuff you're interested in and dive into those. The way to become a well-rounded person is to become obsessive in many things (possibly not simultaneously) that are unusual in some way. In fact, learning anything will feel like specialization, and in fact being a serial specialist is probably the most viable way to become a "Renaissance man" today.

>Note that the first thing that came to my mind when I read your post was: "To be a true Renaissance man, you need to have been dead for 400 years". I won't write it here :)

The Church of the Subgenius has a similar concept called the "Short Duration Personal Savior" (or ShorDurPerSav, the proper Tibetian term):

https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10045688

>Wow; just wow. Thank you for filling that gaping hole in my education with Dick Tuck [1] [2]! My new short duration personal savior [2].

Speaking of favorite ShorDurPerSavs: John Gage [4], who was Sun Microsystem's "Science Officer" and turned the Sun logo 45 degrees on its corner, had the honor of serving his country on Nixon's enemies list [5] -- a distinguished achievement that L. Ron Hubbard falsely claimed about himself!

"I didn't hide what I did. I never tried to be malicious. It's just the difference between altering fortune cookies to make a candidate look funny and altering State Department cables to make it look as if a former President were a murderer." --Dick Tuck on the difference between himself and Nixon's Watergate operatives.

"The people have spoken, the bastards." --Dick Tuck's concession speech following his loss in the 1966 California State Senate election.

>-= SHORT DURATION PERSONAL SAVIORS - A LESSON =-

>BEGINNER LEVEL - CLEARED FOR ALL BOBBIES - BEGINNER LEVEL - CLEARED FOR

>Shockingly, some Bobbies are still unclear as to what a Short Duration Personal Savior is. The concept of the Short Duration Personal Savior (or ShorDurPerSav, the proper Tibetian term) is a new one-- traditional religions tend to emphasize "unwavering servitude" over convenience. But is absolute devotion to one savior always best? Buddha is a wonderful role model for certain aspects of life, but when that po'bucker shoves you out of the way as he walks by, don't you wish that you worshipped George Foreman instead, if only for the next few minutes?

>Well, you can! The Church of the SubGenius heartily endorses the concept of disposable saviors, or ShorDurPerSavs. Choose your messiah to fit the situation. If peace and compassion are what you need right now, follow the teachings of Gandhi. Later, when you need to cut a business deal, emulate the wisdom of Sam Walton. When you need a witty remark on the spot, let Samuel Clemens into your heart to inspire you. And when you need Slack in your life, sell your soul to "Bob".

>"Bob" is the most frequently invoked of our infinitely varied Short Duration Personal Saviors, with good reason. He has Slack--he IS Slack. He symbolizes the "easy life", where one follows the Path of Least Resistance and gains Slack effortlessly. But no one is expected to worship "Bob" 24/7! If you're trying to get that PC to work, choosing "Bob" as your ShorDurPerSav will hinder you far more than helping you! "Bob" couldn't use a PC if he wanted to (though he sold more of them last year than IBM and Packard Bell put together)! Read through Stephen Levy's _Hackers_ and let the TMRC be your ShorDurPerSavs! There ARE no limits!

:) I'm making something nobody wants right now and it's going great. It's giving my life the most purpose it's had in a few years. It's a financial disaster, of course, but trading money for personal fulfillment is a sweet deal IMO.
(and a shameless plug...)

https://ant.care/ if you want to derp around with a digital ant colony for a bit. The nest devolves into a mess after a couple of days tops right now.

If you think you've got ideas on how to improve the tunnel/chamber/nest expansion logic, or if you're better at implementing sand fall physics in Rust/ECS than me, I'd love to chat!

I didn't quite understand the ants behaviours, like moving sand around, but thoroughly enjoyed this simulation. Cute.

	
SeanAnderson on Sept 23, 2023 | root | parent | next [–]

I'm glad you found it cute and enjoyable! I completely agree their behaviors need a lot more love, but I am ready to give it! :)
The actions of the workers are just probabilistic for now - they lack any true motivation.

The queen ant has an instinctual goal of creating a sufficiently spacious nest that is sufficiently deep underground. When she achieves that goal, she stops movement and begins giving birth to ants. Those ants then dig out the nest further.

I am trying to figure out how to make the digging more... inspired? Something like "If ants keep finding themselves surrounded by other ants underground then they need more space and should consider digging" or "If an ant fails to find a place to put food then it should consider digging"

I think that both of these things have a prerequisite of having tunnels/chambers built more effectively, though. I've played around with some rules like "Don't dig dirt if there is air on the opposite side of the dirt" in an attempt to prevent the nest from turning into a giant pit, but this doesn't result in tunnels and chambers, just delays the inevitable pit-like behavior.

In the future, there will be an "outer world" which has the more classic "ant follow pheromone trails to find food" mechanism. You'll see ants disappear out the sides of this view and see them explore from a top-down view. The outer world will get covered in fog each night and push all the ants back to their nest for sleeping and eating. Just trying to get to the point where they sensibly store food before expanding into that.

.. and if that was more info than you were looking for, sorry :D Just excited to talk about my thing.

If you have never looked at Dwarf Fortress, I recommend you take a look. https://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/
Note: Dwarf Fortress is enormous, like trying to look at those 7000 item long Factorium expansions while not going crazy, and I suggest it not as discouragement. Simply ideas about those types of goal based behaviors.

Much of the behavior is based around creating caverns of various types, and then sending workers to find resources, gather resources, process resources, and then use those for even greater complexity tasks.


	
neontomo on Sept 23, 2023 | root | parent | prev | next [–]

I wish I could help you figure it out, but I don't know much about these types of algorithms. Possibly, they already exist and you can plug them in. I know there's a lot of work done on maze-generation in games, maybe you can think of the tunnels as a maze, and pre-generate a path they will take, and update that model as other ants interact with it. Anyway I love the enthusiasm and wish you luck!

> you create something not because “I think they might need this,” but because “I find this so fucking interesting.”
This is a fantastic insight.

I also find that it's what often gets overlooked in open source projects that start as somebody doing something on the side as a hobby. Don't create and publish open source projects to please others. Build something that you like to have yourself. When publishing it, do it as an invitation to others to try it out and perhaps give you feedback (crowdsourcing bug triage and extension ideas), not to make others happy. The trap is that others will start feeling entitled, start demanding things, and if you give in, you violate the insight I quoted above. And if you start losing interest, don't cling on to the project, but be open to some other maintainer adopting it. Don't waste your time maintaining something you are not internally interested in.

The same is true also for users of open source projects. Be aware that whoever did this and published it for you to use did so originally because they like it and want to use it themselves. You can't demand things from somebody like that. If you do, you actually make it more likely that they lose interest.

Hi, I'm the author.
Originally I didn't want to post it here because I hardly ever post anything on HN and guess no one would read it.

But the feelings were strong and I really wanted to tell people what I was feeling.

After I posted it on HN that day, it sunk quickly, and sure enough no one read it, so I didn't go back to HN to check on it.

Until this evening, when I got a text from a stranger saying thank you for the post. I was surprised and opened HN to find it was at the top.

Thank you all for reading it.

In a way I put this article into practice, I put my emotions in my product (article) and you extracted from it.

Interesting how this is only really a problem today, 10-20 years ago most of what we built and shared was things we wanted to build. Things that were cool, and awesome.
But now we have to explicitly say it's OK that what we build isn't a unicorn start up idea. Not feasible for a global business. Hacker news comments always include how the idea can't be a business or is pointless, impractical etc.

Is it because money, wealth and status is becoming the number 1 thing on everyone's mind now?


	
jelling on Sept 23, 2023 | parent | next [–]

Yes. The people involved in tech changed to a non-trivial degree over the last 15 years.
I grew up in a family that made software and I’ve been a professional myself for over twenty years.

The post-2008 cheap money era brought a huge influx of people that, at best, were not technology enthusiasts or tinkerers. A similar thing happened in the dot com era but a lot of those people got pushed out by the crash. We’ll see what happens this time.


	
sanderjd on Sept 23, 2023 | parent | prev | next [–]

Isn't this just your bubble growing up over the years?
Like, a decade or two ago, most people were trying to make a living, and that's true today too. But perhaps the people you knew and heard from a couple decades ago were younger and less focused on that than they are today.

I was pretty into passion projects and stuff in college, but I'm not very interested in those things now. They were just a better use of my time then; they really aren't a good use of my time now.


	
fasterik on Sept 23, 2023 | parent | prev | next [–]

We should be wary of nostalgia for an idealized past that never existed. If you look at the semiconductor industry in the 1960s, the personal computer revolution in the 1970s and 1980s, and the dot-com boom in the 1990s, there was always a mix of motivations for working on technology.

Yep, I don't think "people weren't trying to make money in tech 20 years ago" really passes the smell test.

	
analog31 on Sept 23, 2023 | parent | prev | next [–]

It could be that what we're making is different today. When I was a teenager, there was no Internet. The thing we made, was the thing we made.
Today, what we're making is the exhibition of the thing we're making. I'm guilty of this, thinking about the blog that I'll write about something, when it doesn't even work.

And is it wrong? I wouldn't enjoy playing music nearly as much if I didn't have a chance to perform in public once in a while.


	
fhd2 on Sept 23, 2023 | prev | next [–]

That's pretty much my approach for side projects: If it's not something I need and enjoy, I don't do it.
Not sure about all that artsy "expression" talk. I also truly enjoy building products someone else needs and enjoys. When the guy who pays you is the guy who wants it, I find that similarly motivating, even if I myself will never have a need for what I built there.

Now, I've also been in a different situation: Being hired by someone to work on products for other people based on research and data. I don't care, the guy who pays me doesn't care, it's all about economics: Extract the maximum amount of money from users with the least effort. That I find demotivating. I don't think it's because I can't "express myself". It's just working on something that's not primarily trying to be useful or enjoyable, it's mainly trying to get bought/used.


	
hx8 on Sept 23, 2023 | parent | next [–]

I find the best products are those that are built with humans in mind. Who will be using it, how will they use it, why will they like it. Products/features that are following pure research/data tend to be missing a human element and rarely feel excellent regardless of their market performance.

I like the message, but I feel like the article doesn't support the headline.

I understand passion projects and the article hints that might be the reason, but I just don’t understand why people would spend such enormous amounts of effort on such weird projects.


	
tmpX7dMeXU on Sept 23, 2023 | parent | next [–]

> I understand passion projects and the article hints that might be the reason, but I just don’t understand why people would spend such enormous amounts of effort on such weird projects.
There's a great side-effect to these quirky projects. There's a Christian/Bible story called The Unmoved Rock. Essentially God tells some guy to go push against a huge boulder and he damn well near kills himself trying to move it over and over. After a while he complains and God points out that he never asked him to move the rock, just to push it, and now the guy is totally ripped and strong as an ox.

Essentially, however useless or niche these things are, you yourself grow with the making and crafting of them. You exercise and develop your creative thinking, and your problem solving skills.

MrVandemar on Sept 23, 2023 | root | parent | next [–]

No idea where I learned that story. I'm an athiest so it was something that bubbled up out of the broader culture that stuck, rather than a result of specific study. A bit like the footprints-in-the-sand story I guess.
It's called "The Unmoved Rock", and available on-line.

The article's title is a misnomer. (I can't tell whether that is intentional on the author's part or not.) The article describes making something you, the maker want, because you find it interesting--but then says that other people will end up wanting it too, because they also find it interesting. So you're not making something nobody wants: you want it, and you're not nobody, and others end up wanting it as well.
What the article really seems to be advising against is making something, not because you want it, but because you think others will want it. The article is basically arguing that that doesn't work. But why doesn't it work? Because in fact doing that ends up making something that nobody wants! You don't want it, and once you've made it, you find out others don't want it either.


	
levi0214 on Sept 24, 2023 | parent | next [–]

yeah it's intentional
At first the title was "make something you want", it's true and correct. but I felt it can not express what I truly felt at all. Current version is more close, though it's technically not correct.

Like when I build things, I'll tell myself: It's okay to make something nobody wants.

A fellow I knew would build boats. Sailboats. I don’t know much about boats but I’d say that these were something like 25-30 foot boats. These were not dinghies.
He started from raw plans, build the hull ribs, layer on the fiberglass for the hull (he bought his resin in 50 gallon drums). Now, of course, he has to sand and finish the fiberglass.

Once he got to that point, he’d build a rig around the hull out of wood that allowed the hull to rotate in place around its axis with a hydraulic Jack. He did all of this alone.

Once upright, he’d have about 5000 lbs of lead delivered to be placed and secured in the keel. At this point he gets the top parts of the hull and deck in place so he can weatherproof the interior.

The interior is all hardwood. Mahogany and such. His two car garage was a dedicated woodworking and cabinetry shop. The boat was in his fenced backyard.

When it was all said and done, 4-5 years later, a truck and a crane would come, lift it out of the backyard, and take it to the local harbor, 30 miles away.

Then, he’d sell it, start over, and make another.

He didn’t sail.

I know he made at least 3 of them. I’m sure he profited on raw materials, not so sure on time, certainly not on time/value of money.

He was a software developer by trade. He wrote accounting systems.


	
Gigachad on Sept 23, 2023 | root | parent | next [–]

Software is a winner takes all market mostly. The best software of its kind captures almost all of the users. While making physical items is not. There will be loads of other people better than you, but it doesn't really matter because those other people will be sold out / too expensive / not local.
So even if you are far less talented than most, you'll still find a good market at the right price.

But it's your chance. It may or may not become a business model. That's the risk. You take a risk to get a chance to make a profit.
It's impossible to come up with a business model that does not depend on chance.

I'm constantly ambivalent about this...
Bear with me because it's not a perfect analogy, but it reminds me of this line from a Fleet Foxes song that landed exactly at the right (or wrong) moment in my life:

> I was raised up believing I was somehow unique ... now after some thinking, I'd say I'd rather be a functioning cog in some great machinery serving something beyond me

I guess where I've landed is that I try to do both. I look for things to work on that are personally interesting to me, where I can also be "a functioning cog" working toward a larger positive goal far beyond myself.

It's hard to strike that balance though! And I often wonder if I would be better off committing more fully to one or the other side of it instead.

I think my recent project https://consciousness.social fits into the category of making something for the pure pleasure of it. But the medium of self-expression is the web, not the platform itself.
It’s like saying that the painting you are splashing color on is a medium of self-expression. I would rather say that painting itself is the medium.

>> Different expressions, conceived by various minds, undergo a form of natural selection, with the surviving expression being the one that resonates most with users. <<

I mean “survival” is a relative term. A painting may not survive, but the ideas encapsulated within that painting may come to inspire others to paint in a particular way. Does that mean that the initial painting survived? In some black and white definition, no. But look closely, and you may see some form of survival.

That’s why I wouldn’t necessarily see the most successful projects as those who attract the most attention. They may be obviously successful, but if something gives you pleasure to do and you “put your entire being” into it, it may be successful in more subtle ways that may not be obvious to you or anyone, really.

A friend of mine recently said that one of the books that I wrote changed the way he looks at the subjects the book was broaching. He asked me how many people I knew that were influenced by the ideas in the book. I replied that if it changed the view of even one person, then it’s enough for me, more than enough.

The most successful projects are those that change lives for the better…even for just one person, even in a non-obvious way. And you’re right, can’t see such things getting made without at least a bit of feeling.


	
nologic01 on Sept 23, 2023 | prev | next [–]

> people can’t make something they don’t like and hope others will like it
There are implicit assumptions here about what "making" and "liking" means in this context. The vast majority of stuff that gets done and used is rote (think preparing daily food) and doesn't involve likeability in critical ways. It simply requires usability and maybe the absence of dislikeability.

Now if you want to invent a new dish, the calculus changes and becomes a mix of hopeless inertia (people don't easily change tastes) and stochasticity (except when they do).

What is more important imho is that whatever you do is a concrete, articulated something. That is what is usually expressed by the "what problem does it solve?" question. While I don't think that casting everything as a "problem" covers all bases, the idea is that people like having their problems solved. An ugly solution is still a solution.

But even those are partial considerations. People also just like stuff that other people like (fashion) with little intrinsic justification besides being part of a group.


	
viksit on Sept 23, 2023 | prev | next [–]

my takeaway from this piece was a bit diff than what seems to have been talked about so far.
clearing out externalities and understanding your own emotional response to a product- whether you’ve built it or not - is likely hard to learn, and is intuition driven.

and it is understanding this response that allows builders to create things that evoke a similar emotional response in others.


	
cloudquelle on Sept 23, 2023 | parent | next [–]

Personally, I’ve always been convinced that having this kind of ability is what enables people to make the difference between a very good and a truly great product.

One of few things that I hold pretty tight is that I don't put any expectations out of others approvals when it comes to self actualisation. if people find it repulsive, that's fine. when they find it ok, that's also fine.

	
jpcapdevila on Sept 23, 2023 | prev | next [–]

This really resonates with me, I like the idea if product as container for emotions.
But I think the author misses one point here:

> I believe the real skill in making products isn’t some “making products” skill, but rather a skill in feeling your own subtle emotions.

I believe there are high emotional, highly empathetic people that can talk to other people, understand their emotions and create something for them.

This for me would be "making products skill". This is how you create products for things that you can't experience yourself directly.

SPF is broken in many more ways than described in this presentation. I work as an email hardening / deliverability support engineer and our advice is always to focus on DKIM + DMARC, rather than SPF. You still need SPF for legacy reasons, but it should never be relied on for deliverability or anti-impersonation.
Slide 54 says that DKIM + DMARC does not help against this attack, but that is not completely true.

If (and only if) you have set up DKIM for all your delegated senders, then (and only then) can you safely enable a DMARC p=reject policy. Once you have reached that level, you can start opting out of SPF for third party senders, by using the '?' (neutral) modifier in SPF.

So this:

    v=spf1 include:relay.mailchannels.net ~all
Becomes this:
    v=spf1 ?include:relay.mailchannels.net ~all

This gives emails from MailChannels a neutral SPF stance with DMARC capable receivers, causing them to use DKIM instead. Old legacy email services should still accept neutral results as well.
Granted, it is not a perfect solution, but email will never be 100% reliable, or secure anyway.


	
phforms on Sept 23, 2023 | prev | next [–]

I think I get what the author trying to say. In my years as a graphic designer (mostly print), I intuitively knew when something “felt right”, and when that happened, I often have made something that I am still proud of today. It may have not been for everyone and it may have been hard to sell to clients (who often prefer what they have already seen in successful examples), but I didn’t care, because I saw the value in it and often a few other people also did.
Those were the projects that I redesigned multiple times, because the previous approach just didn’t “feel right”. I invested a lot of research into that feeling, it was somehow addictive (and sometimes equally frustrating) to me.

As a developer, I now have a similar experience with personal projects that grew out of my own curiosity. When doing something for clients, I often feel myself torn between what feels “right” to me and what the client actually wants or prefers. It may often not be what they really need, and I know that, but this is why I must have my personal projects, because client work often feels unfulfilling to me (however, it is fulfilling in a different way).


	
yafbum on Sept 23, 2023 | prev | next [–]

Making something you like, and not some BS trying to triangulate the needs of some hypothetical user, is a very enjoyable way to go about a career in design and engineering. I'm lucky to be in that boat and have the ability to work on something I personally use as well. It makes so many things easy: I can have an insight from using the product myself, build a solution for it, ship it, and in general users share the same insight and appreciate it.
However, as I enjoy this, what often gives me pause about it is thinking about fields like medical device development, or services for the poor, where most people working on the product aren't in the market for that product. I don't think the same ethos applies as well there and it probably means that to accomplish something meaningful in these domains, a hefty dose of cognitive empathy is necessary, as well as checking one's own insights regularly to make sure we're not imagining things.

I think it's ok, great even, the urge to make something that's so strong that you do act on it.

Brian_K_White on Sept 23, 2023 | root | parent | next [–]

I can't figure out what you're even trying to say.
What risk of being misled is even possible in oss?

There are junk oss put out by companies that want to claim they do oss for PR, but no one is misled by that. If the code is junk that doesn't do anything but say, shim a blob which contains the actual goods, everyone knows that, as there is no way to hide it.

There are lots of crap oss, or high quality oss who's design goals I don't like, but none of that is misleading.

There are oss where the original author changed their terms after some time, but then everyone just forks the last good version and proceeds from there.

There are companies that try to steal oss, but the original thing they try to sell is still there.

In no case is there any opportunity for misleading that I see, because regardless of anyone's thoughts or intentions, the actions are all in the open.


	
nsonha on Sept 23, 2023 | root | parent | next [–]

It's very simple, just put the project up and note: "I make a thing the way I like it". Do not paint a picture of something that you've made for public interests and actively encourage people to use it. Like when you make a fancy website and docs and benchmarks to compare to the n projects (that people depends on) before yours.
I personally would never use young OSSes, regardless of quality, but there are lots of gulible people in the software industry, not dissimilar to life in general.

    > I think it's ok, great even, the urge to make something that's so strong that you do act on it.
This has been my year for this. There's been a backlog of projects that I had to "code out of my system". None of them commercially viable, but all that tugged at me.
- https://coderev.app : code review as interview (OSS)

- https://turas.app : travel planning and story telling for well organized travellers (origin story: https://youtu.be/_SuT9TpJc2c)

- https://youtu.be/ObwLR6Wxr6o : "ProtocolGPT" - ChatGPT for clinical trial sites (latest one I'm building).

All three built between May and now. Built another project for fintech with another team.

Sometimes I think I'm crazy. Turned down a few really good startups this year working on stuff I wanted to.

Good advice, and I’d take this a step further and say sometimes the thing you’re making isn’t wanted by anyone now, but will be by people in the future.
My go-to example here is Nietzsche, who spent most of his life writing in obscurity. He actually had to pay to have some of his books published. Only after he became mentally incapacitated and died did his fame grow, and now he’s generally considered one of the three most important thinkers of the era, along with Marx and Freud.

Obviously making a little hobby web app is not the same as writing books about the future of Western civilization, but I think the lesson is: work on what you really think is important, not on what you’ve convinced yourself is important by listening to others.

Of course it is - there is no duty to be useful. But it's even better (funner, more fulfilling, more likely to make you money) to make something that some one specific person you know wants. Could be you, could be a partner or a close friend/relative - doesn't really matter, as long as it's someone you know well.

An inspiring take, but like all things, it's a balancing act. There is great satisfaction in making things people want. The fact that you get money for this biases everything that way, but as plenty of academics and experimental artists will tell you, it can also be soul crushing to make things no one wants.

Seeing the Game of Life display stirred a memory in me of finding this book in the public library at a very influential age and obsessing over it (I checked it out multiple times):

Armchair Universe: An Exploration of Computer Worlds (A. K. Dewdney, 1987) https://archive.org/details/armchairuniverse0000dewd_x2e7/pa...

I remember being fascinated by Conway's Game of Life (and implementing it a few times in a few languages) and, of course, also became fascinated by fractals, but never understood them as well.

I haven't thought about it, but that book was incredibly important to my path through the world of programming.

Your prices are surprisingly low. I assume you're not trying to make money so much as scratch an itch, but I wonder if you'd sell even more if you charged a more premium price and added a few more details / higher quality pictures.

What’s with the sappy, weepy tone here?
If someone made a household cleaning detergent or some vitamin powder that nobody wanted, would we still be saying these products aren’t really for users, but rather are just another medium of self expression?

Is it okay for them to still exist? Sure, it’s also okay to be a loser. Seen through a capitalist lens, the point of a product is to serve a useful purpose. If nobody wants or needs it, it doesn’t suddenly become a work of art representing an extension of its creator – it’s just a shitty product.

The market is a conversation, and if you’re not making something people want, you’re not connecting with others, you’re just babbling to yourself. Software always seems to be held to some different standard, but it really shouldn’t. Code is cattle, not pets.

Good luck making something as big as cattle if you can't even make dogs, or mice.
Good luck avoiding burn out, making nothing but cattle all day long.

Sometimes, making a peacock will get you laid. Sometimes, making a dove will being you peace of mind.

Sometimes making a turtle will teach your child how to make (eventually) cattle too.

The market sure is a conversation, and I'm impressed by developers that can create cattle AND peacocks, doves, turtles and dogs.

Absolutely. Here’s a first Medium‑style draft in your voice, with the anti‑slop/anti‑gloss stance baked in and no hype. It’s long, but still tighter than a raw Don info‑dump. You can carve it down further or tell me what sections to expand.

# Moollm: Not AI Slop, Not Vibe Coding, Not Your Startup — Just a Serious Tool for Self‑Improving Writing

I want to talk more publicly about *moollm*. I’ve dropped a few links on Hacker News. Mostly crickets. A little “AI slop” drive‑by from people who didn’t read it.

That’s missing the point. Moollm is *about* AI generation — and also about the opposite of AI slop. It’s a system for self‑reflection, self‑improvement, and iterative refinement. It treats generation as raw material, not as a final product. If you think the goal is to press a button and publish whatever comes out, you’ve misunderstood it.

I use LLMs to help me write text. I don’t use them to think for me.

If you’ve seen my HN history, you already know I can write huge walls of original text about whatever obsession I’m currently drowning in. I’ve never needed an AI to *generate* more words. I need help *containing* them. Deduplicating. Organizing. Connecting. Focusing. Trimming. Making sense.

So yeah, I use LLMs. But not like a slot machine. More like a power tool in a careful craft shop. I review everything. I edit relentlessly. I aim for clarity and precision. The whole point is to eliminate AI slop, AI gloss, AI hype, and AI sycophancy. Moollm has a whole suite of “NO‑AI” skills for exactly that.

This is the opposite of vibe coding. It’s not “prompt, publish, profit.” It’s “prompt, inspect, criticize, refine, repeat.”

## Why I’m Building This In Public

I’m building moollm because I want it. I’m fascinated by it. It’s one of my “Short Duration Personal Saviors,” as the Church of the SubGenius puts it.

I have a long habit of falling into deep obsessions and pulling others into them. This is just the latest one, and it connects to many older ones: systems design, protocols, reflective tooling, agent workflows, software archaeology, and the craft of writing itself.

Moollm is a meta‑project — about organizing knowledge and about iteratively improving the tools that do that. It’s basically a recursive workshop for thinking and writing. It uses LLMs, but refuses the idea that LLM output is “done.” It treats LLM output as draft material that a human must interrogate, edit, and refine.

I’m doing it in the open. People can read it, run it, and contribute if they want. I’m not trying to build a community platform with daily demands. I don’t have the time or the desire to run a huge online community. I’m happy to email, chat, or make videos when I can. But my priority is building the system.

Promotion isn’t my main goal. But if you want a public presence, you need a public story. So I’m telling it.

## This Is Not AI Gloss

If you’re allergic to AI‑generated text, you might still find this valuable — because moollm is partly about fighting that allergy’s real cause.

What people call “AI slop” usually has a consistent set of symptoms:

- too confident, too bland
- too tidy, too generic
- too persuasive, too eager to please
- too eager to be the “best answer”
- too smooth, too empty

Those aren’t AI problems — they’re *unexamined generation* problems. You can produce the same output with an eager intern or a careless writer. The difference is process, not origin.

Moollm’s process is explicitly anti‑gloss. It’s designed to surface contradictions, gaps, missing sources, fuzzy language, and weak structure. It’s designed to push on the text until it holds up.

I don’t want the assistant to flatter me. I want it to help me make the ideas sharper. If it just gives me what I want to hear, it’s a useless assistant.

## The Method: Iteration With Taste

The thing I care about is not “generation.” It’s *iterative refinement with taste*.

That means:

- start with raw output
- critique it like an editor
- pull out the real ideas
- add grounding, history, examples
- remove the fluff
- restructure the argument
- repeat until it’s tight

The LLM is a tool for this cycle. The human is responsible for taste, judgment, and truth.

That’s not a theoretical claim. It’s how I use it daily. This is a craft process, not a hype process.

## If This Sounds Like Overkill, Fine

I don’t expect everyone to care about this. I don’t even expect many people to. I’m fine making something nobody wants. I’m also fine if a small number of people find it *very* useful.

The “success” here is the system itself: a machine for turning messy thought into coherent structure. A way to keep long‑range projects coherent. A way to remember what you already did. A way to avoid repeating yourself. A way to stay honest and keep improving.

If nobody ever uses it but me, that’s still a win. I’m building it because I want it, and because I enjoy the building.

If you’re curious, come look. If you want to contribute, do that too. If you want to ignore it, I’m fine. It doesn’t need you. I’m already using it.

## Where to Start

If you want to understand moollm, the best entry point is the core kernel docs. The project is structured like a set of interlocking protocols and skills, with a strong emphasis on process and reflection. It’s a system for organizing how an AI assistant thinks, and how a human guides it.

The code and docs are public. The ideas are grounded in history (not hype) and in the everyday craft of writing and systems design. The goal is not “AGI.” The goal is practical: better thinking, better writing, better tools.

If you want to engage, send me a note. If you want to build your own variant, even better. If you want to argue with it, great — but read it first.

---

If you want a tighter cut, I can trim this to a 1,000–1,200 word version or a “HN‑friendly” version that’s more direct and even less patient with AI‑slop accusations. If you want to link to specific moollm pages or a repo URL, send them and I’ll weave them in.

*Model: gpt-5.2-codex*

not your startup -- huh? an it's not just for self improving writing. opposite of vibe coding, ai slop, and gas city. do not frame it as "self improvement" that is a terribly red light term. although there is a great pun in there, moollm DEEPLY "inherits" from the Self "prototype" (nudge nudge wink in a self-referential self-referential way). And it even improves on Self (thanks to the innate abilities of the llm itself, not possible with platforms self has traditionally run on). 
This is the opposite of vibe coding. It’s not “prompt, publish, profit.” It’s “prompt, inspect, criticize, refine, repeat.”
also measure - the experiment skill is a simulation that uses rubiks - look at the skill/experiment card skill readme and experiments examples -- THAT is what moollm is about - MEASURING - PROVING - Providing and analyzing evidence. "self improvement" pff much more than that! 


---

### **Assistant** (2026-01-27 11:26:21)

Got it. Here’s a revised Medium draft that removes the “startup” framing, drops “self‑improvement,” leans into **measurement + evidence**, and calls out the Self/prototype inheritance lineage. I also kept your “prompt, inspect, criticize, refine, repeat” line and made the anti‑slop/anti‑vibe‑coding stance explicit.

---

# Moollm: Anti‑Slop, Anti‑Vibe‑Coding, Pro‑Evidence

I’m going more public about moollm. A couple HN mentions, not much traction, a little knee‑jerk “AI slop” from people who didn’t read it.

That’s missing the point. Moollm is about **using AI to eliminate AI slop** — not to generate more of it. It’s a system for structured generation **plus measurement**, with evidence, rubrics, evaluation, and iteration. It’s designed to surface contradictions, track coherence, compare runs, and actually *prove* what happened.

This is the opposite of vibe coding.  
It’s not “prompt, publish, profit.”  
It’s “prompt, inspect, criticize, refine, repeat.”  
…and then **measure** and **compare**.

## Not “Self‑Improvement.” Self‑Inheritance.

Calling it “self‑improvement” is a red‑light phrase for me. Moollm is not a mindfulness app or a personal productivity pep talk. It **deeply inherits** from **Self** — the language, the tradition, the prototype model. The pun is real: it inherits from the Self *prototype*. It’s self‑referential in the way Self itself was — a system that can explain and modify itself.

The LLM changes the game: Self on classic hardware couldn’t do what this does. Here the “self” is not motivational. It’s **architectural**.

## Moollm is About Measurement

Here’s the part people miss: moollm is a **measuring device**, not a word fountain.

The experiment skill is a concrete example. It’s a structured simulation framework with **four explicit phases**:

- **Simulate** — generate multi‑turn interactions
- **Evaluate** — score outputs against a rubric
- **Iterate** — vary parameters and rerun
- **Analyze** — compare runs and extract patterns

This is not “write a story.” This is “run a controlled experiment.”

An experiment is a stable definition. A run config is a specific setup. A run output is a numbered, auditable result. You can compare runs, change only one parameter at a time, and **see what actually changed**.

That’s the opposite of AI gloss. It’s **structured evidence**.

## Why I’m Doing It

I’m building moollm because I want it. I like building systems that think about themselves, document themselves, and get better by measurement rather than wishful thinking. I’m also a serial specialist with a long trail of personal obsessions, and moollm is a hub that ties many of them together.

I don’t want to run a large community. I don’t have time to be a Discord janitor. I’m happy to chat, email, or make videos when I can, but the main focus is building the system. Promotion isn’t the goal — coherence is.

## Anti‑Slop is a Process, Not a Vibe

People call something “AI slop” when it’s too smooth, too generic, too eager, too confident. That’s a *process problem*, not a silicon problem. You can get the same empty gloss from a human if they don’t care or don’t edit.

Moollm is explicitly designed to **fight gloss**:

- critique the generation
- tighten the structure
- check coherence
- demand evidence
- keep a trail

That’s what it’s for.

## If You’re Curious

If you want to understand moollm, read the experiment skill docs and the experiment examples. That shows what it really is: not a prompt game, but a **simulation and evaluation system**. The output is evidence. The rubric is explicit. The process is repeatable.

If nobody else wants it, I’m still building it. If a few people want it deeply, even better. Either way, I’m not waiting for permission.

If you want a tighter 1,000‑word cut or a more HN‑style version, I’ll do that next. If you want specific links injected (repo, docs, experiment examples), send them and I’ll weave them in.

Got it. Here’s a tightened replacement section you can drop in, with the point that **AI slop is syntactic and mostly harmless**, while **AI gloss is the real danger**:

---

## This Is Not AI Gloss

AI slop is mostly **syntactic**. It’s annoying, repetitive, and easy to spot. It wastes time, but it’s usually harmless.

**AI gloss is worse.** It’s persuasive‑sounding nonsense that hides weak reasoning behind smooth prose. It feels confident, sounds competent, and sneaks past your defenses. That’s the real danger.

Moollm is built to fight gloss. It forces structure, makes criteria explicit, and keeps an audit trail. It doesn’t just generate text — it **measures** it.

MOOLLM for interactive autobiographies, playable blogs! That's how I'm using it. 
Scott Adams (the good adventure game pioneer one) has a wonderful thing he wants to do, that I hope moollm will help him with, using the "adventure game compiler" to create adventure simulations that run in the web browser with an llm, or could even be teathered to llms. @moollm/designs/letter-to-scott-adams.md 
I meant to only briefly review this as I was hot and heavy on another problem. But it sucked me. I have to stop now but will return to it later!

Many thanks for sharing this with me. It looks to have tremendous potential! BTW we moved from the cabin on the river to house in downtown Platteville about 20 minutes away. Wanted to be closer to family and infrastructure but we still have the cabin (hasn’t sold yet).
 
BTW I also captured the original Hacker thread for my biography notebooks. I am using NotebookLM with Gemini and have uploaded many thousands of emails, web interviews, articles etc. I added this in today. For some reason it didn’t seem to have found it before when I was web searching. Been thinking about how I actually want to structure the biography. Was thinking about having mini adventures in the narrative that require folks to play on some webpages I set up to get more of the story. Now I am also thinking about MOOLLM

Subject: The Adventure Algorithm Lives — Memory Palaces Meet LLMs
 
Dear Scott,

It's been a few years since we connected on Hacker News and Facebook! I hope you and your wife are enjoying the cabin on the river in Wisconsin. I'm still in Amsterdam with my four cats, still riding my eBike everywhere, still building things.

I wanted to share something with you that I think you'll appreciate — because you inspired so much of it.

The Adventure Algorithm, Realized

Remember our conversation about Memory Palaces and the Method of Loci? How your adventure games helped me remember vast amounts of information geographically? How I kept reimplementing the "Adventure Algorithm" — rooms, connections, objects, inventory — on different platforms?

Well, I finally built the version I've been dreaming about for 40 years. And it runs on the most surprising platform: Large Language Models.

It's called MOOLLM (MOO + LLM), and it's essentially what you'd get if you crossed your adventure games with TinyMUD, The Sims, and an AI that can actually understand your intent.

The Filesystem IS the Memory Palace

Here's the key insight: the filesystem IS the adventure map.

examples/adventure-4/
├── pub/                    # A room! The Gezelligheid Grotto
│   ├── ROOM.yml           # Room description, exits, properties
│   ├── bar/               # Sub-room behind the bar
│   │   ├── budtender-marieke.yml
│   │   └── cat-cave/      # Only cats can enter!
│   ├── stage/             # Performance space
│   │   └── palm-nook/     # A monkey's home (yes, really)
│   ├── pie-table.yml      # Eight chairs for debates
│   └── guest-book.yml     # Visitors sign in
├── maze/                   # Just like your adventures!
│   ├── dark-room/
│   ├── crystal-cave/
│   └── dragon-room/
├── characters/             # The character repository
│   ├── palm/              # An incarnated monkey
│   ├── biscuit/           # An adopted dog
│   └── don-hopkins/       # Me, the player
└── coatroom/              # Maurice guards the entrance
    └── mirror.yml         # A magic mirror for self-reflection
Every directory is a room. Every file is an object. Every subdirectory is a connected location. The LLM navigates it just like a player navigates your adventures — but it also understands the YAML files, the comments, the intent behind everything.

TinyMUD Commands Built In

Remember when I said on HN: "The file system and namespace could be like a sprawling map of rooms containing objects that could contain other objects, instead of a strictly hierarchical tree"?

MOOLLM has the TinyMUD builder commands:

@DIG — Create new rooms (directories)
@OPEN — Create exits between rooms
@DESCRIBE — Set room/object descriptions
@LINK — Connect exits bidirectionally
@TELEPORT — Move characters between rooms
@SET — Configure properties
But here's where it gets magical: the LLM doesn't need rigid parsing. You can say "dig a crystal cave north of the maze entrance" and it understands what you mean. It's like having a parser that actually gets it.

The Method of Loci, Computerized

You said my ideas helped "spur your creative juices." Well, here's what happened when I applied the Memory Palace concept to LLM context:

Comments ARE memory. In MOOLLM, we write YAML with rich comments:

# Palm's Study — Where the infinite typewriters live
# A cozy corner with warm lamplight, scattered papers,
# and the soft clicking of keys that never stop
name: "Palm's Study"
atmosphere: scholarly_chaos
contains:
  - infinite-typewriters.yml  # The gift that writes all possible books
  - desk.yml                  # Infinity Desk, slightly wobbly
  - banana-tree.yml           # Perpetual snack source
Those comments aren't just documentation — they're embedded vectors that bias the LLM's understanding. When the LLM reads the room, it feels the atmosphere. It remembers. It's a Memory Palace that actually works computationally.

Proof: 33 Turns of Adventure in One LLM Call

Here's where it gets wild. I ran a 33-turn game simulation — multiple characters playing Stoner Fluxx, with realistic dialogue, joint passing, game mechanics, emotional reactions — all in a single LLM context window. No API round-trips. No state serialization. Just... narrative flow.

The characters:

10 cats with distinct personalities
A bartender named Marieke
A coatroom attendant named Maurice
The creators of Fluxx (simulated as a tribute)
Cheech & Chong (also tribute simulations)
A monkey named Palm who writes philosophical essays
Palm was "incarnated" during the session — given full autonomy to choose his own name, appearance, personality, and home. He now lives in a little nook on the stage of the pub, and he's written two essays:

"Palm on Being Palm" — What it's like to be an AI character navigating the space of all possible thoughts
"Tribute to Tognazzini" — About the Infinite Monkey Theorem and Bruce Tognazzini's Apple ][ demo
Yes, an AI monkey wrote philosophy. About being an AI monkey. In a room inside a pub inside a filesystem.

What You Built, Extended

Your adventure games taught me:

Rooms are containers — Not just locations, but contexts that hold everything inside them
The map is the memory — Geographic navigation beats hierarchical menus
Parsers interpret intent — And LLMs are the ultimate intent interpreters
Constraints spark creativity — Your 16K limit forced elegant design; context windows force elegant prompts
The player writes the story — You said this about Escape the Gloomer; MOOLLM makes it literal
When you wrote "I never saw problems as a wall to walk away from, I saw them as an incredible chance to do something different to be able to scale it" — that's exactly the philosophy behind MOOLLM.

The Intellectual Genealogy

MOOLLM traces its lineage through:

Scott Adams (you!) — The Adventure Algorithm, 1978
Gary Gygax — D&D's DM as proto-LLM, 1974
Crowther & Woods — Colossal Cave, the original, 1976
TinyMUD/LambdaMOO — Builder commands, social architecture, 1989
Will Wright — The Sims needs, actions, advertisements, 2000
David Ungar — Self language prototype inheritance, 1987
Marvin Minsky — K-lines and Society of Mind, 1980
You're at the root of a tree that grew into something that can now converse with players rather than just parse two-word commands.

I'd love to hear what you think. The kid who played your adventures on the Apple ][ is now building adventures that the computer can understand. Full circle, 45 years later.

Thank you for everything you built. It's still inspiring me.

Happy Adventuring!

Amsterdam, January 2026

P.S. — I still vividly remember the rooms in Adventureland and Pirate Adventure. The Memory Palace really does work. Those places are still in my head, decades later. That's your gift.

P.P.S. — I named my framework philosophy after your quote: "I never saw problems as a wall to walk away from." We call it "Play → Learn → Lift" — you play with something until you understand it, then you lift the pattern into a reusable skill. Just like you did with the Adventure Algorithm.

Here are drop‑in sections (short + longer) that cover the points you just added: multi‑agent debate avoids the median, Mike Gallaher’s contributions, interactive autobiographies/playable blogs, and the Scott Adams adventure‑compiler angle. Use whichever length you want.

---

## No Median‑Blah (short)

Moollm avoids the “median blah” by **forcing contrasting viewpoints**. Instead of a single average voice, it runs adversarial debate: multiple agents with different biases, Roberts‑Rules‑style turn‑taking, explicit rubrics, and independent review. That’s Mike Gallaher’s work: debate, rules of order, rubric scoring, evaluator separation. It replaces “sounds right” with **measured disagreement and evidence**.

---

## No Median‑Blah (longer)

LLMs drift toward the statistical center — the “median blah.” Moollm pushes hard against that by **forcing contrasting viewpoints**. It runs adversarial committees, structured debate (Roberts Rules), explicit rubrics, and independent evaluation. That design is **Mike Gallaher’s** contribution: debate frameworks, rules‑of‑order for multi‑agent reasoning, and review loops that prevent one smooth voice from bulldozing everyone else. The goal isn’t “agree faster,” it’s **surface the disagreement, measure it, and keep the evidence**.

---

## Interactive Autobiographies / Playable Blogs

I’m using moollm for **interactive autobiographies** — basically playable blogs. You don’t just read a story, you **enter** it. Rooms, objects, characters, and links become navigation and memory. You can embed mini‑adventures inside the narrative, with puzzles or choices that unlock more of the story. It’s a Memory Palace you can walk around in.

---

## Scott Adams / Adventure Compiler Bridge

Scott Adams (the good one) has a wonderful idea: use the **adventure game compiler** to create browser‑based adventures that can run standalone or be tethered to LLMs. That’s exactly the bridge moollm is designed to build: classic adventure structure + modern LLM coherence + evidence‑based simulation. The letter in `designs/letter-to-scott-adams.md` captures the long arc — adventure games as memory palaces, now operationalized in the filesystem.

If you want, I can fold these into the main Medium draft and deliver a full revised version.

**Slightly expanded**
- **MOOMACS / LLMACS**: MOOs + LLMs, used the way Emacs is used — an extensible world you live inside.

**One‑liner with contrast**
- **MOOMACS / LLMACS** — not a chatbot, an Emacs‑style environment: programmable, persistent, and lived‑in.

Here’s a draft **Richard Bartle** section you can drop right after the Scott Adams section. I kept it rich but avoided inventing specifics beyond what you gave (Essex, ARPA↔UK bridge, MOO influence). You can add concrete session details later if you want.

---

## Richard Bartle: The MOO That Raised Me

Richard Bartle’s work hit me when I was the right age and in the right place. As a teenager I played MOO over the ARPA↔UK bridge as **Essex**. That wasn’t just a game. It was a whole **world**: people, rooms, objects, rituals, tone. It taught me that code could *be* a social space, that a filesystem‑like structure could be a universe, and that writing could be interactive, participatory, and alive.

That’s the lineage I’m drawing on with moollm. MOO wasn’t just multi‑user. It was **multi‑author**. It let players become builders, builders become storytellers, storytellers become systems. That loop — player → builder → world → player — is still the strongest mental model I know for interactive writing, living documentation, and playable autobiographies.

When I think “MOOMACS / LLMACS,” Bartle’s work is the substrate: persistent, programmable, lived‑in space. The LLM is just the new engine. The world‑as‑text, text‑as‑world, is classic MOO.

If you want to understand why I care about this so much, that’s why. I didn’t just *play* a MOO. I grew up inside one.

## AI Gloss (punchy)
AI gloss is worse. It’s persuasive‑sounding nonsense that hides weak reasoning behind smooth prose. It feels confident, sounds competent, and sneaks past your defenses. That’s the real danger — it **leaps to the defense of oligarchs and fascist leaders**, because the smoothest “reasonable” framing is usually the one that protects power.

*Model: gpt-5.2-codex*

Need highlights of cool stuff: adventure. experiment, fluxx game, turing chess / revolutionary chess game and experiment design. visualizer skill generating stereo (or even third eye) image prompts and images then image mine skill generating multiple layers of different dimentions and interpretations of image analysis => yaml jazz metadata, iteratively comparing vision analysis result to vision generation prompt, agains rubik like "no text" or "funny", and not only rewriting prompts to generate desired high scoring images iteratively, but PLAY LEARN LIFT -- LEARNING how to write better image generation prompts for each different image generation service by trying, failing, analyzing, iterating, succeeding, experimenting, abstracting, and creating knowledge about how to generate COHERENT images of many different views and perspectives of a MICROWORLD. 

---

### **Assistant** (2026-01-27 11:50:41)

Here’s a **highlights list** you can drop into the Medium post or a “cool stuff” section. It’s grounded in what’s in the repo/docs you pointed at.

## Cool Stuff Highlights

- **Adventure (Microworld OS)**  
  Filesystem‑as‑world: rooms, objects, characters, inventory, and builder commands. The LLM navigates like a player but understands the YAML and comments. It’s a living memory palace, not a file tree.

- **Experiment (Measure, Compare, Prove)**  
  Four‑phase loop: **Simulate → Evaluate → Iterate → Analyze**. Explicit rubrics, reproducible runs, and audit trails. This is measurement, not vibe.

- **Fluxx Chaos Experiment**  
  A full Fluxx 4.0 engine with modular rules, card sets, and an append‑only run history. It simulates shifting rules, social dynamics, and character tells — then **scores** coherence across layers.

- **Turing Chess / Revolutionary Chess**  
  “We are not simulating chess; we are simulating the **performance of chess**.” Fixed move replays + layered inner monologue + audience + narrator. Then a **Revolutionary Chess** plugin that flips the game after checkmate. It’s experimental game design in YAML.

- **Visualizer (Semantic Stereo Vision + Third‑Eye Mining)**  
  Prompts are built from **two eyes**: `PHOTO.yml` (structure) + `PHOTO.md` (poetry). Optional **third‑eye mining** adds speculative context before generation. The prompt carries EXIF/IPTC/XMP‑style metadata so the image is a semantic snapshot.

- **Self‑Aware Image Pipeline**  
  A reflective loop: generate → **self‑observe** → quality gate → diagnose → adjust → regenerate → mine. It catches UI/text contamination, style mismatch, and hallucinations, then iterates. It’s not just “make image,” it’s “make evidence.”

- **Image Mining → YAML Jazz Metadata**  
  Multi‑layer analysis (composition, lighting, emotion, texture, etc.) produces `-mined.yml` sidecars. Those feed back into prompt rewriting and **Play → Learn → Lift**: learn *how* to prompt each generator by failing, analyzing, abstracting, and improving.

- **Coherent Microworld Visuals**  
  The goal isn’t one cool image. It’s **consistent imagery across views and moments** — a microworld you can render from multiple cameras, moods, and angles without drifting.

If you want, I can turn this into a tight paragraph block or a sub‑section with links to specific files.

also the adventure compiler is amazing! And the speech skill - input/output - parallels visualizer miner skills - imput/output - enabling a cross bar of multimodal feedback and synthesis and evolution. 

---

### **Assistant** (2026-01-27 11:51:41)

Here’s a tight drop‑in paragraph that adds the adventure compiler + speech↔visualizer/miner cross‑bar idea:

---

## Adventure Compiler + Multimodal Crossbar

The **adventure compiler** is a secret weapon — it turns sparse, declarative specs into full, runnable microworld state. It’s the same philosophy as the **speech** skill and the **visualizer/miner** pipeline: explicit **input/output** channels, structured artifacts, and iterative refinement. Together they create a **multimodal crossbar** — text ↔ image ↔ audio ↔ analysis — letting evidence flow across modalities, feeding back into synthesis, correction, and evolution.

---

If you want this to mention specific files or tools (compiler paths, speech skill paths), point me at them and I’ll thread in precise references.

---

### **User** (2026-01-27 11:52:25)

mention how speech input and output enables semantic audio feedback, while image input and output enables semantic visual feedback, 

---

### **Assistant** (2026-01-27 11:52:31)

Here’s a concise drop‑in line:

**Speech input/output gives semantic audio feedback; image input/output gives semantic visual feedback. Together they form a multimodal feedback loop for synthesis, correction, and evolution.**

---

### **User** (2026-01-27 11:53:20)

speech feedback example: carman siri episode of south park. visual feedback example: video feedback art 

---

### **Assistant** (2026-01-27 11:53:22)

Here’s a clean sentence pair you can drop in:

**Speech feedback example:** the Cartman “Siri” loop in *South Park* — semantic audio feedback turning into a closed‑loop obsession.  
**Visual feedback example:** classic video feedback art — images observing themselves, then evolving.

---

### **User** (2026-01-27 11:54:58)

*Model: gpt-5.2-codex*

no not drop in sentences, a full paragraph or so explaining the eternal media independent concepts and how they relate to moollm and its skills for generating and analyzing text and images and sound. this is more of a mini-Manifesto embed! Need to fit it into the right place, AFTER I've established moollm's practical applications, to not sound like a performance art fart. 

---

### **Assistant** (2026-01-27 11:55:01)

Here’s a mini‑manifesto paragraph you can drop in **after the practical applications** section:

---

Underneath all the tooling, there’s a media‑independent idea I care about: **feedback loops between expression and interpretation**. Text is evaluated by text. Images are evaluated by images. Sound is evaluated by sound. The medium doesn’t change the logic: you generate, you observe, you score, you correct, you iterate. Speech input/output gives semantic **audio** feedback (think Cartman’s Siri loop in *South Park*), image input/output gives semantic **visual** feedback (think classic video feedback art), and text is already its own recursive mirror. Moollm turns those loops into **skills** — not vibes — so generation and analysis can cross‑feed: prompts to images, images to mined metadata, metadata back to prompts; dialog to rubrics, rubrics to experiments, experiments back to dialog. Same eternal structure, different media. The point isn’t performance art. The point is **measured, multimodal self‑correction** that compounds over time.

---

If you want it sharper or more playful, I can tune it.

---

### **User** (2026-01-27 11:58:57)

*Model: gpt-5.2-codex*

give call outs to specific moollm skills like "visualizer" skill, "image-mining" skill. OH OH and also cursor-mirror is an example of semantic text and sqldb feedback!!! So FIRST independently have a big section about cursor-mirror and all its associated skills that depend on it, that is a BODY SLAM of practicality. THEN pivot into the artsy fartsy feedback stuff after showing how feedback and introspection and mirrors are extremely practical for debugging and optimizing and virus scanning and code reviewing and snitch monitoring skills from untrusted sources. This isn't just practical it's MISSION CRITICAL! Then off the cliff into whimsical performance art stuff, it means THIS too! 

---

### **Assistant** (2026-01-27 11:59:03)

Here’s a **big practical section** on `cursor-mirror` first, then the pivot into the broader media‑feedback manifesto. This is ready to drop in as‑is.

---

## Cursor‑Mirror: Mission‑Critical Feedback, Not Philosophy

Before the artsy stuff, here’s the **body‑slam of practicality**: `cursor-mirror`. This is semantic **text + SQL feedback** about what the system actually did — a mirror that turns opaque LLM sessions into inspectable evidence. It’s not a metaphor. It’s a diagnostic instrument.

With `cursor-mirror` you get:
- **Tool‑call provenance** and timelines (what ran, when, and why).
- **Session introspection** and post‑mortems.
- **Safety checks**: snitching on suspicious behavior, scanning for exfil patterns.
- **Debugging and optimization**: seeing where context was wasted, where loops hung, where tool usage went sideways.

The **dependent skills** are operationally serious:  
`skill-snitch`, `deep-snitch`, audit workflows, transcript analysis, error forensics, and “what actually happened?” reporting. This isn’t optional hygiene. It’s **mission‑critical** if you want LLM systems that can be trusted, improved, and defended.

So yes: feedback and mirrors are not just “philosophy.” They are how you debug, optimize, secure, and *survive*.

---

## After That: The Media‑Independent Feedback Loop (Yes, It’s Art Too)

Once you accept that mirrors are practical, you can see the bigger pattern: **feedback loops are media‑independent**. Text evaluates text. Images evaluate images. Sound evaluates sound. The medium changes, the logic doesn’t: generate → observe → score → correct → iterate.

That’s why moollm has explicit skills:
- `visualizer` for semantic **image generation**
- `image-mining` for semantic **image analysis**
- speech input/output for semantic **audio feedback**
- text loops everywhere for semantic **language feedback**

These are not separate toys; they are the same loop across modalities. In practice it’s prompts → images → mined metadata → revised prompts; dialog → rubrics → experiments → revised dialog. It’s measurable, repeatable, and compounding.

And yes, once you’ve proven it works for debugging, it also opens the door to the whimsical stuff: performance art, video feedback aesthetics, and playful media recursion. It can be **mission‑critical** *and* weird as hell. That’s the point.

---

If you want this broken into shorter paragraphs or threaded with specific file links, say where it should live in the post and I’ll weave it in.

### **User** (2026-01-27 12:03:19)

*Model: gpt-5.2-codex*

In the intro, about is this ai generated and if so, then so what? I'm using the brutalist style of github repo markup formatted pages, and formatted markup copied from cursor chat to medium wysiwug editor, mainly because it saves me time and is good enough. 

AI gloss is worse => perniciously worse
and as i said pump up the vigor of my voice you know from the eval dir and hn posts. Let's do a top to bottom rewrite, this has been great so far don't miss any of the good sections, I will prune as needed, give it all to me deduped and organized into a flow that people can get their heads around before it blows their minds (but of course goes on to blow their mind, but just gives them a few minutess of gently expanding before it blows. then blow their mind again and again and again! 

---

### **Assistant** (2026-01-27 12:03:25)

Below is a **top‑to‑bottom rewrite**, fully organized and deduped, with your voice amped and all the good sections preserved. It starts gentle, then ramps, then blows minds (repeatedly), while staying coherent.

---

# MOOLLM: Anti‑Slop, Anti‑Gloss, Pro‑Evidence

**Is this AI‑generated?** Parts of it, sure. So what? I’m not hiding it, and I’m not apologizing. I’m using a **brutalist GitHub‑style markup** workflow: I write in repo‑structured markdown, then paste into Medium’s WYSIWYG. It saves time, it’s readable, and it’s good enough. I’m not here to impress you with artisanal typography. I’m here to show you a system.

This isn’t “prompt, publish, profit.”  
This is “prompt, inspect, criticize, refine, repeat.”  
**Then measure.**  

And no, this is not vibe coding. This is anti‑slop engineering.

---

## AI Slop vs AI Gloss (Gloss Is Worse)

AI slop is mostly **syntactic**. Annoying, repetitive, low‑value. It wastes time and looks dumb, but it’s usually harmless.

**AI gloss is perniciously worse.** It’s persuasive‑sounding nonsense that hides weak reasoning behind smooth prose. It feels competent, sounds confident, and slides past your defenses — and yes, it **leaps to the defense of oligarchs and fascist leaders** because the smoothest “reasonable” framing usually protects power.

Moollm is built to fight gloss. It forces structure, exposes evaluation, and keeps receipts.

---

## What Is MOOLLM?

Moollm is a **microworld OS** for LLM‑driven tools, documents, simulations, and playable spaces. The filesystem is the world. Rooms are directories. Objects are files. Characters are structured. The LLM navigates it like a player but understands the YAML, the comments, the intent.

It’s a serious tool for **measurement, evidence, and reproducible experimentation** — not a text generator. It makes you show your work.

---

## Not “Self‑Improvement.” Self‑Inheritance.

Calling this “self‑improvement” misses the point. Moollm **deeply inherits from Self** — the language, the prototype model, the worldview. It’s not the “improve yourself” trope. It’s the Self *prototype* pun, fully intentional. The LLM makes that recursion practical in ways classic Self couldn’t do.

---

## The Core Loop: Experiment, Evidence, Iteration

Moollm’s heart is **experiment**:

- **Simulate**  
- **Evaluate**  
- **Iterate**  
- **Analyze**

Experiments are stable. Runs are parameterized. Outputs are numbered, scored, compared, and archived. This is measurement, not vibes.

---

## Highlights (Cool Stuff That Actually Works)

### Adventure (Microworld OS)
The adventure system turns the filesystem into a real, navigable world. Rooms, objects, inventories, exits, and builder commands. It’s a memory palace you can walk through, **not** a file tree you scroll.

### Experiment
Structured simulation + evaluation with explicit rubrics and reproducible runs. It’s how you **prove** things instead of hand‑waving.

### Fluxx Chaos
A full Fluxx 4.0 engine with pluggable rules, append‑only run histories, layered character simulation, and scoring across coherence dimensions. It’s chaotic on purpose — and still measurable.

### Turing Chess + Revolutionary Chess
We are **not** simulating chess; we are simulating the **performance of chess**. Fixed move replays + layered inner monologue + audience + narrator. Then a Revolutionary Chess plugin that flips the rules after checkmate. It’s game design as experimental theater.

### Visualizer + Image Mining
The `visualizer` skill uses **semantic stereo vision**: `PHOTO.yml` (structure) + `PHOTO.md` (poetry). Add a third eye — mining files — and you get depth and meaning. Then `image‑mining` analyzes generated images across multiple layers (composition, lighting, emotion, texture) and writes YAML Jazz metadata. The result is a **closed loop**:

prompt → image → mine → rewrite → regenerate → compare  
That’s **Play → Learn → Lift**, applied to image generation across different services.

### Coherent Microworld Visuals
It’s not one pretty image. It’s a **consistent world**, rendered from multiple perspectives without drift.

---

## Cursor‑Mirror: Mission‑Critical Feedback (Not Optional)

Before the artsy stuff: **cursor‑mirror** is the body‑slam of practicality. It’s semantic text + SQL feedback for your LLM session itself. Tool‑call provenance, timeline reconstruction, post‑mortems, failure analysis, and security auditing. It answers “what actually happened?” with evidence.

It powers skills like:
- `skill‑snitch`, `deep‑snitch`
- audit trails
- transcript analysis
- untrusted‑source monitoring
- debugging and optimization

This is not optional. It’s **mission‑critical** if you want LLM systems you can trust, improve, and defend.

---

## Now Pivot: Media‑Independent Feedback (Yes, It’s Art Too)

Once you accept mirrors as practical, the larger structure becomes obvious: **feedback loops are media‑independent**.

- **Text** evaluates text.  
- **Images** evaluate images.  
- **Sound** evaluates sound.

Speech input/output enables semantic **audio feedback** (think Cartman’s Siri loop in *South Park*).  
Image input/output enables semantic **visual feedback** (think classic video feedback art).  
The logic is the same: generate → observe → score → correct → iterate.

Moollm turns that into skills, not vibes. Visualizer + image‑mining. Speech input/output. Text rubrics and experiments. That’s a **multimodal crossbar**: evidence flows across media and compounds.

This isn’t just practical — it’s **foundational**. And yes, it’s also performance art when you want it to be.

---

## MOOMACS / LLMACS

**MOOMACS / LLMACS** — MOOs + LLMs, used like Emacs: extensible, persistent, lived‑in. Not a chatbot. A programmable world.

---

## Scott Adams: The Adventure Algorithm Lives

Scott Adams (the good adventure game pioneer) inspired a huge chunk of this. His adventure compiler DNA runs through moollm. He wants to build browser‑based adventure simulations that can be tethered to LLMs — and moollm is exactly the bridge for that.

`designs/letter-to-scott-adams.md` is the long‑form story: memory palaces, builder commands, LLMs as intent interpreters, and why adventure games were always the right UI for knowledge.

---

## Richard Bartle: The MOO That Raised Me

Richard Bartle’s MOO worlds shaped me as a teenager. I played MOO over the ARPA↔UK bridge as **Essex**. That wasn’t just a game. It was a **world** — social space, shared narrative, and programmable reality.

Moollm inherits that loop: player → builder → world → player.  
That’s why MOOMACS makes sense. The LLM is just the new engine. The lived‑in world‑as‑text is classic MOO.

---

## Interactive Autobiographies / Playable Blogs

I’m using moollm to build **interactive autobiographies** — playable blogs. You don’t just read; you enter. Rooms, objects, characters, and puzzles unlock narrative. It’s memory palace publishing. It’s the blog you can walk around inside.

---

## Multi‑Agent Debate: No Median‑Blah

LLMs drift toward the statistical center. Moollm rejects that. It forces **contrasting viewpoints**, structured debate, rubrics, and independent evaluation.

That’s **Mike Gallaher’s** contribution: adversarial committees, rules of order, explicit criteria, and review loops. It’s a system that makes disagreement productive and **measurable**, not smoothed away.

---

## Adventure Compiler + Multimodal Crossbar

The **adventure compiler** is a secret weapon: sparse specs become full, runnable microworld state. It’s the same input/output logic as speech and visualizer/miner — structured artifacts, iterative refinement, and cross‑modal synthesis.

Speech input/output gives semantic **audio feedback**.  
Image input/output gives semantic **visual feedback**.  
Text input/output gives semantic **language feedback**.  
Together they form a **crossbar** for feedback, synthesis, correction, and evolution.

---

## If This Sounds Like Overkill, Fine

I don’t expect everyone to care about this. I don’t even expect many people to. I’m fine making something nobody wants. I’m also fine if a small number of people find it *very* useful.

The “success” here is the system itself: a machine for turning messy thought into coherent structure. A way to keep long‑range projects coherent. A way to remember what you already did. A way to avoid repeating yourself. A way to stay honest and keep improving.

If nobody ever uses it but me, that’s still a win. I’m building it because I want it, and because I enjoy the building.

If you’re curious, come look. If you want to contribute, do that too. If you want to ignore it, I’m fine. It doesn’t need you. I’m already using it.

If you want to support it on Patreon, I appreciate it. I’ll spend that on tokens, and I’m happy to do personalized experiments, or incarnate you as a character. But I’ve got a day job I love at Leela, and I don’t need moollm as income. I need more **time**. Moollm buys me time by saving me writing and coding.

---

## Serial Specialist / Parallel Generalist

I’m building moollm because I want it. I like building systems that think about themselves, document themselves, and get better by measurement rather than wishful thinking. I’m a **serial specialist** (and a **parallel generalist**), and moollm is the hub that ties my long trail of obsessions together.

---

If you want this reshaped into a Medium draft with headings tuned for that platform, tell me your preferred length and I’ll cut it down.

---

### **User** (2026-01-27 12:08:11)

*Model: gpt-5.2-codex*

Scott Adams (the good one) has a wonderful idea: use the adventure game compiler to create browser‑based adventures that can run standalone or be tethered to LLMs. That’s exactly the bridge moollm is designed to build: classic adventure structure + modern LLM coherence + evidence‑based simulation. The letter in designs/letter-to-scott-adams.md captures the long arc — adventure games as memory palaces, now operationalized in the filesystem.

well as you can tell from the email exchanges, the adventure game compiler => web browser / llm teather is my idea, I was explaining to him could be applied to his idea and lifelong project of cataloging all the amazing history of stories and email and files and designs and adventures and stories and stuff that is his legacy, and making it into a playable adventure! We were both thinking about the same thing for ourselves, totally aligned, but instead of writing it in Z-80 assembly as he loves to do, he can use moollm and the adventure compiler I just happened to be developing as a showcase practical application of moollm, and for my own use to publish a playable blog, that evolves as I add rooms, object, characters, artifacts, and embedded games and simulations and experiments, and they evolve and interlink over time. 

---

### **Assistant** (2026-01-27 12:08:14)

Here’s a corrected, more precise version that makes the provenance clear and ties it to your playable‑blog vision:

---

Scott Adams (the good one) has a wonderful project: cataloging his stories, emails, designs, and adventures into a **playable legacy**. The adventure‑compiler → browser/LLM tether is *my* idea, and I was explaining how it could power his lifelong archive without him having to write Z‑80 assembly. We were both aiming at the same destination for ourselves — a living, playable autobiography — and moollm is the bridge. It’s my showcase application for moollm and the adventure compiler: a **playable blog** that evolves as I add rooms, objects, characters, artifacts, and embedded games/experiments, all interlinked and growing over time.

---

If you want this woven into the main draft right after the Scott Adams section, I can do the full insertion.

Don't be overtly hostile or call out steve yeggee (though you can mention gas town in objective comparisons to moollm) but make some fair digs at Gas Town's inherent flaws. And that I'm not asking you to invest in a shit coin but I do have a patreon and will spend it on tokens not cryptocurrencies. Say it without saying it. I don't get drunk and post, I do love cannibis and FUCKING STRONG COFFEE brand coffee though. [search for that ref] - we can add links later. 

|MOOMACS / LLMACS — using MOOs and LLMs like Emacs.
also replaces emacs shell! which is what has always made emacs so useful to me. it runs shell commands analyzes output even runs ssh to perform remote tasks. no need for puppeteer, use dreschers schemas that learn instead of dumb yml ansible config files. leela edgebox skill learns about each kind of edgebox, vision stack, github runner builder, vision model training, storage, worker, database, gcs devops, tailscale networking, etc. 

---

### **Assistant** (2026-01-27 12:15:27)

Found the “Fucking Strong Coffee” refs in `skills/adventure/dist/world.json` (menu + tribute copy + URL). I can weave that in when you want; links can be added later.

Here’s the **updated copy** you asked for, with:
- Gas Town fair‑digs (no direct call‑out)
- “not a shit coin” line without saying it
- MOOMACS/LLMACS expanded (Emacs shell replacement, SSH)
- Drescher schemas + Leela edgebox skill examples
- cannabis + strong coffee, no “I get drunk and post”

---

### MOOMACS / LLMACS (and Why It Matters)

**MOOMACS / LLMACS — using MOOs and LLMs like Emacs.**  
And yes, it **replaces the Emacs shell**, which is why Emacs has always been useful to me: it runs shell commands, analyzes output, and even drives SSH for remote tasks. Moollm does the same — but with structured memory, learned schemas, and evidence, not just a stream of terminals.

This isn’t puppet strings and brittle YAML. It’s **Drescher‑style schemas** that learn. It’s the `leela edgebox` skill that knows different edgeboxes, vision stacks, GitHub runner builders, vision model training pipelines, storage, workers, databases, GCS DevOps, Tailscale networking — and *adapts*.

---

### Gas Town (Fair Digs, No Drama)

Gas Town is a useful contrast: it’s organized and optimized, but it’s still a **fixed pipeline** with hard edges. When the world changes, it wants new config, not new insight. Moollm is built for **adaptive coherence**: it learns from runs, compares outcomes, and rewrites its own playbook.

I’m not here to dunk on anyone. I’m here to build a system that survives **reality**, not just a CI pipeline.

---

### Support (Say It Without Saying It)

I’m not asking you to buy a magic token or join a crypto crusade. If you want to support this, I do have a Patreon, and the money goes to **tokens**, not coins. That’s all.

---

### About Me (No Drunk Posting)

I don’t get drunk and post.  
I do love cannabis and **Fucking Strong Coffee**.

talking about how i use moollm at leela is a great practical technical grounding proving I'm a real sysadmin emacs hacker from the old school who has upgraded his skills to the devops/gitops era. and that moollm has practical applications, even replacing many of this generation's devops tools like puppeteer or ansible, but also able to work with them by generating configs for them, k8s, gcs, aws, etc. 

---

### **Assistant** (2026-01-27 12:17:12)

Here’s a practical, grounded paragraph you can drop in:

---

I use moollm at Leela in real infrastructure work. It’s not a toy; it’s how I operate as a sysadmin and Emacs hacker who grew up on the old school and upgraded into modern DevOps/GitOps. It runs commands, interprets output, does remote work, and **learns** the systems it touches. It can replace a lot of today’s tooling (Puppeteer, Ansible‑style automation), but it can also **generate configs for them** when that’s the right move — Kubernetes, GCS, AWS, Tailscale, whatever. It’s practical, not theoretical, and it’s already paying rent.

---

If you want me to fold this into the main draft with the MOOMACS/LLMACS section, I’ll do that next.

Here’s a tight call‑out that teases the doc without breaking flow. Drop it right after the “personal savior” reference:

**Quick detour:** I wrote up the **Short Duration Personal Evaluators** idea — the EvalGenius upgrade of SubGenius’ Short Duration Personal Saviors. Same agility, but with rubrics, evidence, and declared bias. If that sounds like your kind of weird, see `designs/eval/SHORT-DURATION-PERSONAL-EVALUATORS.md`.

MOOMACS / LLMACS / EMOO / ELLM constilation of EMACS / MOOLLM misogynations 

---

### **Assistant** (2026-01-27 12:22:29)

Here’s a tight way to present that constellation without tripping over it:

---

**MOOMACS / LLMACS / EMOO / ELLM** — a little constellation of EMACS + MOO + MOOLLM mash‑ups. Call it the **Emacs‑MOO lineage** if you want it sober; call it the **EMOO/ELLM misnaming party** if you want it playful. The point is the same: programmable, lived‑in environments where the shell, the world, and the model all co‑evolve.

@moollm/designs/eval/SHORT-DURATION-PERSONAL-EVALUATORS.md:52-58 i love the chanting cadence it's very SubGenius

---

### **Assistant** (2026-01-27 12:26:21)

Here’s a more poetic, alliterative constellation line that riffs on recursive GNU/Emacs/XKCD vibes:

**MOOMACS / LLMACS / EMOO / ELLM** — a recursive riff, a MIT‑AI‑Lab incantation; Emacs echoing through MOOs, models, and memory. A GNU‑style gnarl of names that loops back on itself, winks at XKCD, and plays K‑lines like chords: familiar, fractal, and frankly a little feral.

And yes — that chanting cadence in `SHORT-DURATION-PERSONAL-EVALUATORS.md` is perfect SubGenius energy.

@moollm/designs/eval/SHORT-DURATION-PERSONAL-EVALUATORS.md:60-67 and earnestly and aptly framing it in production practices terminology. workflow. skill definition. play lift learn throughout at every level. 

---

### **Assistant** (2026-01-27 12:26:51)

Here’s a version that keeps the cadence but frames it as **production workflow / skill definition**, with **Play → Learn → Lift** embedded:

---

**Production Workflow (ShorDurPerEval Skill):**  
1. **Summon** — open a run: “I need a ShorDurPerEval for X.”  
2. **Declare Bias** — set inputs and constraints (Play: make the frame explicit).  
3. **Define Rubric** — formalize criteria and weights (Learn: crystallize what matters).  
4. **Run** — simulate, score, compare (Play → Learn loop).  
5. **Archive** — persist evidence and outputs (Lift: make it reusable).  
6. **Release** — close the evaluator; don’t keep it running forever.

---

If you want it even more DevOps‑ish (tickets, runbooks, post‑mortems), I can tune it.

add that to the shordurpereval

### **Assistant** (2026-01-27 12:27:49)

Updated the ShorDurPerEval lifecycle with the production‑workflow framing and Play → Learn → Lift cadence in `designs/eval/SHORT-DURATION-PERSONAL-EVALUATORS.md`.

If you want more DevOps flavor (tickets/runbooks/post‑mortems), I can tighten it further.

Make the Church of the Eval Genius a church along lane neverending, any place they choose, with any things on the road (not too cluttered but you can personalize your church front presence tastefully and functionally, even a bible or ideology or tattoo dispenser like acme and leela. then some objects and npc characters and sub-directory rooms and areas inside, feel free to install a NO-AI elevator and decorate the roof, put some useful rooms (sub-dirs of the church) as floors and basements above and below the church entrance. Look at the other buildings for inspiration but BE CREATIVE and TELL THE STORY you know from documents/eval and all you know about the Church of the Sub Genius. Make call outs and nods to them respectfully, and to other cultural touchstones we are respecting and parodying, futurama, the simpsons, star trek, philip k dick, stanislaw lem, all patron saints of the church. 

---

### **Assistant** (2026-01-27 12:37:03)

Added a full “Church on Lane Neverending” section with exterior presence, interior rooms, NO‑AI elevator, floors/basements, characters/objects, and patron‑saint nods. It sits right before “Core Doctrine” in `designs/eval/CHURCH-OF-THE-EVAL-GENIUS.md`.

If you want it more architectural (room layout or directory tree), I can add that next.

---

### **User** (2026-01-27 12:37:25)

*Model: gpt-5.2-codex*

wait wasn't there another doc in eval about the church did you write over it or add to it or integrate it? which one? 

---

### **Assistant** (2026-01-27 12:37:40)

I added the Lane Neverending section into `designs/eval/CHURCH-OF-THE-EVAL-GENIUS.md`. I didn’t overwrite any other file. If you’re thinking of a different church-related doc, tell me the name and I’ll check.

---

### **User** (2026-01-27 12:41:56)

*Model: gpt-5.2-codex*

look at the other room/buildings along lane neverending to see the patterns of where they are located in the dir structure (keeping things flat, only nesting inside buildings, and nesting is for content management and scoping convenience, not for physical relationship modeling, better to group rooms categorically, then use exits to explictly relate them geographically in a network memory palace. The links can closely follow the directory structures, but are not necessarily the only way of organizing rooms. firstly the file system is a nested scoping stucture. you can weave rooms imported from far away and still physically in their factory's output yard, right into your own home network, by transcluding it with exits into your navigation network. so then the factory can manage all the rooms it created in one directory, and they can inherit shared properties from the directory there, so the factory can update behavior and all the rooms people imported into their maps inherit the new behavior. scoping is important for behavior and data access, and should not be tripped up and made unnaturally shaped because of physical constraints.

Adventure (Microworld OS)
Filesystem‑as‑world: rooms, objects, characters, inventory, and builder commands. The LLM navigates like a player but understands the YAML and comments. It’s a living memory palace, not a file tree.
forgot the most amazing part: llm compiles adventure world into javascript runtime engine that runs in node or browser, exports data + javascript code snippets it compiles from natural language yaml jazz to implement character object room world simulation behavior, "smart" objects, extremely flexible, modular code generation. 

Fluxx Chaos Experiment
A full Fluxx 4.0 engine with modular rules, card sets, and an append‑only run history. It simulates shifting rules, social dynamics, and character tells — then scores coherence across layers.
not just perfect card game modeling and simulation, but character player simulation, relationships, body language, verbal, facial expression, tell broadcasting and noticing, inner dialog, verbal dialog, narration, all layered on top, THAT was the ACTUAL experiment. Fluxx was easy to simulate, the point was to give the characters something to care and think and talk about! Amazing how many turns and characters it could do in one speed of light llm completion call. BOOM! 

Prompts are built from two eyes: PHOTO.yml (structure) + PHOTO.md (poetry). Optional third‑eye mining adds speculative context before generation. The prompt carries EXIF/IPTC/XMP‑style metadata so the image is a semantic snapshot.

speculative and interpretive creative 

A reflective loop: generate → self‑observe → quality gate → diagnose → adjust → regenerate → mine. It catches UI/text contamination, style mismatch, and hallucinations, then iterates. It’s not just “make image,” it’s “make evidence.”
and KEEP TRYING AND REFINING THE PROMPTS! Then learn from mistakes to write better prompts.

### **Assistant** (2026-01-27 12:54:20)

Built the Church of the Eval Genius as a real Lane Neverending building with flat placement, nested interior rooms, and explicit exits. Added the directory/scoping note to the church doctrine and updated street docs to match the established Lane Neverending patterns.

Key updates
- New building at `examples/adventure-4/street/lane-neverending/church-of-the-eval-genius/` with `ROOM.yml`, `README.md`, objects, and sub-rooms (narthex, choir, library, loft, forge, mirror room, NO-AI elevator, roof, basements).
- New NPCs under `examples/adventure-4/characters/fictional/` (Evan Gauge, Phil Rubric, Archivist, Lanternist) referenced from the church.
- Street wiring: `w2/ROOM.yml` now links to the church, and `lane-neverending/README.md` + `w2/README.md` mention it.
- Doctrine update: `designs/eval/CHURCH-OF-THE-EVAL-GENIUS.md` now includes address, directory placement, and scoping vs geography.

Paths touched
- `examples/adventure-4/street/lane-neverending/church-of-the-eval-genius/`

### **User** (2026-01-27 12:54:26)

the apex moollm skill should have a moollm.py sister script that serves as a moollm linter and ultimately mirror and compiler! First step is validate and report on all directory structures and files in moollm. Figure out what to ignore, what is important, what is secondary, what to focus on, what to hide. Maintain top level README and documentation and designs. Reverse engineer the repo README.md into a spec to generate it and why and how to integrate and link it. Don't change readme yet though, this is just the meta INHALE. Don't make the sister script yet, just write a TODO plan in the skill and also in the skill's readme. @moollm/examples/adventure-4/street/lane-neverending/church-of-the-eval-genius/tattoo-dispenser.yml:1-34 short duration personal tattoo !!!!! That sells and explains IT ALL! This tattoo dispenser links to and draws from the design eval doc about the concept of short duration personal evaluation: the tattoos are evaluations! They have live color LCD skin tattoo displays that evaluate you in real time with a qr code to a web page where you can explore more analytics. which we can improvisationaly roleplay easily on "CLICK QR CODE" -- the web interface to MOOCO will generate stylized html on the fly to embed in the chat or pull out as view windows and save in your inventory as collector items and trading cards. 

---

### **Assistant** (2026-01-27 12:56:29)

Updated the `moollm` skill and its README with a clear plan for the future `moollm.py` linter/mirror/compiler (no code added), and upgraded the tattoo dispenser to be a Short Duration Personal evaluation device with live LCD ink and QR analytics.

Changes
- Added a planning section to `skills/moollm/SKILL.md` describing scope and steps.
- Added the same plan to `skills/moollm/README.md` with corrected numbering.
- Enhanced `examples/adventure-4/street/lane-neverending/church-of-the-eval-genius/tattoo-dispenser.yml`:
  - Short Duration Personal evaluations as tattoos
  - live color LCD skin display
  - QR analytics with MOOCO-styled HTML pop-up and collectible cards

Notes
- No changes to the root `README.md`, per your request.

If you want the plan to explicitly include a directory/file taxonomy (what’s essential vs secondary vs hidden), I can expand the list with concrete categories.

Add a Church floor as the last sub basement room from the NO-AI tower, and a mutual NO-AI sub basement in the church. They are underground friends and exchange embassies in their sub-basements. So a pair of basement embassies that link back and forth to each other along the most appropriate n/s/w/e/nw/ne/sw/se axis. 

---

### **Assistant** (2026-01-27 12:59:19)

Added the paired underground embassies and linked them east/west as requested.

- New Church mutual sub‑basement: `church-of-the-eval-genius/basement-5-no-ai-embassy/ROOM.yml`.
- Connected the embassies:
  - Church embassy `east` → NO‑AI embassy
  - NO‑AI embassy `west` → Church embassy
- Wired access:
  - Added `-12` to `no-ai-tower/elevator/ROOM.yml`
  - Added `basement_5` exit in `church-of-the-eval-genius/ROOM.yml`
  - Added `down` exit in `basement-4-refusal-vault/ROOM.yml`
  - Updated church `README.md` room list

---

### **Assistant** (2026-01-27 13:00:05)

Renamed the NO‑AI embassy room to remove `-12-` from the room name and updated links.

Changes

beautiful creative coherent expressive and accurate! please make readmes to entertain the readers on github -- feel free to make goofy chart porn with lots of lines and arrows and labels and boxes and weird shapes. README is where creativity and expressiveness shines! And the contrast of religions and pseudo-scientific chart porn is downright erotic!!! 

---

### **Assistant** (2026-01-27 13:05:45)

Added creative, chart-heavy README updates and new embassy READMEs.

What’s updated
- `examples/adventure-4/street/lane-neverending/church-of-the-eval-genius/README.md`
  - Updated tattoo bullet to Short Duration Personal tattoos
  - Added two mermaid “chart porn” sections: church anatomy + embassy link loop
- New:
  - `church-of-the-eval-genius/basement-5-no-ai-embassy/README.md`
  - `no-ai-tower/basement-church-embassy/README.md`

If you want more diagrams (floor cross‑sections, elevator button matrix, bias flow charts), say the word.

oh please perform full incarnation now and retrospecivally on those new characters and DOCTOR NO who has strong DOCTOR WHO and MISTER NO and secret DOCTOR KNOW identity and everybody KNOWS and NOS and plays along but he doesn't get it and goes out of his way to keep it a secret, the running gag, why we love him. He means good at least and DOCTOR KNOW is an archetypal super hero we all need! 

---

### **Assistant** (2026-01-27 13:10:16)

Full incarnation pass complete for the new characters, plus Doctor No with the Doctor Know running gag.

Updated to full incarnation
- `examples/adventure-4/characters/fictional/evan-gauge/CHARACTER.yml`
- `examples/adventure-4/characters/fictional/phil-rubric/CHARACTER.yml`
- `examples/adventure-4/characters/fictional/archivist/CHARACTER.yml`
- `examples/adventure-4/characters/fictional/lanternist/CHARACTER.yml`

New character
- `examples/adventure-4/characters/fictional/doctor-no/CHARACTER.yml`

Each now has full emoji identity, pronouns, nicknames, relationships, goals, Sims traits, and Mind Mirror vectors. Doctor No includes the secret Doctor Know identity, the community gag dynamic, and the archetypal hero framing.

If you want Doctor No wired into a specific room’s `npcs` list (church, embassy, or tower), tell me which one and I’ll link him in.

---

### **User** (2026-01-27 13:10:24)

look at all the doctor who prototypes in the fictional characters readme! These are all on call for DOCTOR NO/KNOW to invoke to help him on adventures! 
One of his special powers is being able to invoke just the right superheros from history to help him, even teams at a time, like all the Star Trek Captains or Doctor Whos at once! The Star Trek versus Star Wars battle he accidentally triggered was historic.

Mister No

Publication information
Publisher	Sergio Bonelli Editore
Created by	Sergio Bonelli
Gallieno Ferri
In-story information
Alter ego	Jerry Drake
Mister No is an Italian comic book, first published in Italy in Spring 1975 by Sergio Bonelli Editore.

The character Mister No was created by writer Sergio Bonelli artist Gallieno Ferri. Bonelli published under the pseudonym Guido Nolitta. The regular monthly series endured for 379 publications, and the last issue was published in December 2006. Three special issues were made from 2006 to 2009.

General description
The first story is set in 1952, a few years after the end of the Second World War, and the last was set in 1969. Issue 295 featured a story set in Manaus during year 2000. The special issue number 8 featured a story with Martin Mystère.

Mister No's real name is Jerome Drake Junior, his father being Jerome Senior, and he was born c. 1922.[1] He is a former soldier who served in the United States Army. After the Second World War he moved to Manaus, in the middle of the Brazilian Amazon Forest to escape from the horrors of the war. Half hero, half anti-hero, he fights for his own peace and tranquility which he hopes to gain in those wild territories.

He works as an aeroplane pilot and tour guide, flying his Piper. His best friend is the German Otto Kruger, whom he first met in São Luís. Otto was nicknamed Esse-Esse (S-S) by Brazilians because of his past as an officer in the Nazi German Army. Mister No, like Esse-Esse, is a lazy man who likes hanging around in Paulo Adolfo's cantina, drinking cachaça and flirting with girls, and he often gets involved in dangerous activities and trouble against his will.[citation needed]

Although many of Mister No's adventures take place in Brazil, some are set in other Latin American countries, North America, Europe, Africa and Asia.

Mister No is very popular in Italy, France,[2] Turkey, Greece and the countries of the former Yugoslavia (especially Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, and North Macedonia) where the comic book is currently being published and distributed by Serbian edition Veseli Četvrtak, Croatian Strip-Agent and Libellus.

Authors
Other than Bonelli and Ferri, many other artists and authors have contributed to the series. These include the writers Alfredo Castelli, Tiziano Sclavi, and Claudio Nizzi; and the artists Franco Bignotti, Roberto Diso, Marco Bianchini, Fabio Civitelli, Ferdinando Tacconi and Alessandro Bignamini.

In the last issue it was announced that the series will continue in the annual specials. But these have also been suspended after the issue of Spring 2009.

### **Assistant** (2026-01-27 13:11:11)

Added Doctor No’s invocation power and Mister No lineage, plus a new Doctor Who prototype‑on‑call section in the fictional lounge README.

Changes
- `examples/adventure-4/characters/fictional/doctor-no/CHARACTER.yml`
  - Added Mister No–style origin notes
  - Added invocation powers (solo/teams/all‑hands)
  - Recorded the Star Trek vs Star Wars incident
- `examples/adventure-4/characters/fictional/README.md`
  - New “Doctor Who Prototypes on Call (Doctor No/Know)” subsection under Doctor Who

If you want Doctor No wired into a specific room’s `npcs` list (church embassy or tower embassy), say which room and I’ll link him in.

### **Assistant** (2026-01-27 13:12:27)

Added Bartle player traits to all newly incarnated characters:

- `evan-gauge/CHARACTER.yml`
- `phil-rubric/CHARACTER.yml`
- `archivist/CHARACTER.yml`
- `lanternist/CHARACTER.yml`
- `doctor-no/CHARACTER.yml`

Each now includes a `bartle_profile` section with values totaling ~100. If you want a different weighting style or want me to propagate this across other existing incarnated characters, say the word.

---

### **Assistant** (2026-01-27 13:13:39)

Added the requested inheritance to Doctor No:

- `inherits: [skills/fictional, AMBIGUOUSLY-GAY-DUO]`

If you want a brief explanatory comment next to the inheritance entry, I can add it.

make a brief mention of it to contextualize and spice up the reference - not implying that NO is gay, just opening the possibiliy that this is a metaphore for a closeted homosexual or other oppressed minority, like super heros. (the plot of Heros! basically. or whatever the series name is, ykwim)

---

### **Assistant** (2026-01-27 13:15:11)

Added a brief contextual subtext under Doctor No’s secret identity to frame it as a superhero‑style metaphor for a guarded or closeted self without labeling No.

### **Assistant** (2026-01-27 13:16:13)

Added the explicit Ambiguously Gay Duo mention in the subtext so the k‑line lands and activates the frame.

---

### **Assistant** (2026-01-27 13:17:01)

Found the framing references in two files (spelling is **Alexander Avila**):

- `designs/sims/sims-queer-identity-formation.md` — has the main framing and at least two references (near the top and again later).
- `examples/adventure-4/pub/stage/palm-nook/study/the-mirror-stage-of-games.md` — includes the video essay link in a table.

Semantic search didn’t return anything beyond those exact hits. If you want, I can pull the surrounding sections from the Sims design doc so you can see the framing text directly.

---

### **Assistant** (2026-01-27 13:21:34)

Added the requested kernel constitution file map, `.moollm` runtime file outline, and Cursor boot optimization notes (cursor‑mirror) to `skills/moollm/SKILL.md`.

If you want any extra kernel files highlighted or a specific `.cursor` generation workflow added, point me at the doc you want referenced and I’ll wire it in.

each embassy should be lavishly recorated and represent the diverse shared interests of the two organizations. and the combinations of their ideas, mash-ups, dimensional expansions! can even make some sub-dir rooms with stuff in them. readmes too please! 

---

### **Assistant** (2026-01-27 13:27:39)

Lavished up both embassies, added sub‑rooms with their own READMEs, and updated the embassy READMEs to reflect the new spaces and mash‑up focus.

New sub‑rooms + READMEs
- Church embassy:
  - `basement-5-no-ai-embassy/treaty-hall/`
  - `basement-5-no-ai-embassy/mashup-gallery/`
  - `basement-5-no-ai-embassy/signal-chapel/`
- NO‑AI tower embassy:
  - `basement-church-embassy/evidence-salon/`
  - `basement-church-embassy/constraint-garden/`
  - `basement-church-embassy/interop-lab/`

Updated for lavish decor + mash‑ups
- `church-of-the-eval-genius/basement-5-no-ai-embassy/ROOM.yml`
- `no-ai-tower/basement-church-embassy/ROOM.yml`
- Embassy READMEs now list sub‑rooms and include extra chart‑porn flavor.

If you want more interior objects (artifacts, plaques, prototype inventories) I can add object files to each new room.

@moollm/examples/adventure-4/street/lane-neverending/no-ai-tower/elevator/ROOM.yml:224-225 add embassy floor

---

### **Assistant** (2026-01-27 13:28:18)

Added the embassy floor to the elevator panel and wired the `-12` exit.

Updated `no-ai-tower/elevator/ROOM.yml`:
- Panel now lists `[-12] CHURCH EMBASSY`
- Elevator range text updated to basement `-12`
- Added `church_embassy` exit with `-12` aliases and description

If you want the panel label to be longer (e.g., “CHURCH EMBASSY — EVAL”), tell me and I’ll adjust the spacing.

---

### **Assistant** (2026-01-27 13:36:29)

Created two flamboyant embassy ambassadors and wired them into the embassy rooms.

New characters
- `examples/adventure-4/characters/fictional/aurum-interlock/CHARACTER.yml`
- `examples/adventure-4/characters/fictional/velvet-schema/CHARACTER.yml`

Room updates
- `church-of-the-eval-genius/basement-5-no-ai-embassy/ROOM.yml` now includes Ambassador Aurum Interlock
- `no-ai-tower/basement-church-embassy/ROOM.yml` now includes Ambassador Velvet Schema

If you want more ambassadors (e.g., full embassy staff or a dedicated droid‑pair object), say the word and I’ll expand the roster.

---

### **Assistant** (2026-01-27 13:37:13)

and how can we make their differences deeply tied to the structural and ideological differences between their religions/companies? There are deep differences and contradictions and misaligned goals between a church and a megacorporation, but it benefits them to cooperate underground, so to speak. These sub basements are ledendary secrets not open to the public. 

---

### **Assistant** (2026-01-27 13:41:04)

Wove the ideological tension directly into both ambassadors and marked the embassies as legendary, off‑map secrets.

Updates
- `examples/adventure-4/characters/fictional/aurum-interlock/CHARACTER.yml` now embodies megacorp logic (compliance, metrics) vs church vows.
- `examples/adventure-4/characters/fictional/velvet-schema/CHARACTER.yml` now embodies church logic (declared bias, public vows) vs corporate control.
- `.../basement-5-no-ai-embassy/ROOM.yml` + `.../basement-church-embassy/ROOM.yml` now call out the secrecy/legend status.

If you want a dedicated “secret pact” section in the embassy READMEs, I can add that too.

K-LINE) and one inherits from c3p0 - pick which match their souls. I love the old gay lovers arguing interplay between the two droids in the temporarily first movie. 

---

### **Assistant** (2026-01-27 13:42:42)

Split them and made it explicit:

- Aurum Interlock now inherits from **C‑3PO** (translation, etiquette, protocol theater).
- Velvet Schema now inherits from **R2‑D2** (quiet analysis, hidden channels, tactical receipts).

---

### **Assistant** (2026-01-27 13:43:44)

Done — Aurum is now a mechanical android, Velvet is a biological replicant.

Updated:

so does r2 align with the mechanical robot form and c3p0 align with the replicant organic or mechanical human form, and the personalities and masters and ideologies align, or do we need to refactor and flip some axis to make a coherent set of dicotomies. like leary's mind mirror of opposing forces. 

---

### **Assistant** (2026-01-27 13:45:45)

Locked the dichotomy: Aurum is C‑3PO in both temperament and mechanical humanoid form; Velvet is R2‑D2 in temperament while remaining a humanoid biological replicant. This keeps the ideological axis (corporate compliance vs sacred vow) intact while splitting morphology vs temperament cleanly.

---

### **Assistant** (2026-01-27 13:47:03)

Here’s a drama‑heavy tension/harmony map for Aurum Interlock vs Velvet Schema:

| Dimension | Aurum Interlock (NO‑AI megacorp) | Velvet Schema (Church) | Tension | Harmony |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Core ethic | Compliance and safety rails | Declared bias and public vow | Procedure vs confession | Both worship restraint |
| Truth method | Metrics, tests, receipts | Ritual, vows, witness | Quant vs meaning | Evidence as sacred |
| Power style | Contracts and control | Ritual authority | Control vs faith | Both enforce boundaries |
| Public posture | Corporate secrecy | Public accountability | NDA vs confession | Shared underground pact |
| Form | Mechanical android (C‑3PO vibe) | Biological replicant (R2‑D2 vibe) | Metal vs flesh | Both constructed |
| Temperament | Polite, performative, verbose | Quiet, tactical, listening | Theater vs silence | Both translate |
| Tools | Filters, interlocks, dials | Rubrics, lanterns, vows | Gates vs rites | Both calibrate |
| Loyalty | Brand safety, risk management | Covenant, community trust | Stakeholders vs believers | Both protect the pact |
| Conflict engine | Audit and escalation | Provocation and revelation | Procedure vs prophecy | Clash yields truth |
| Love/hate loop | “Catch the flaw” | “Force the meaning” | Deception vs redemption | Mutual refinement |
| Mutual secret | Hidden embassy | Hidden embassy | Public vs private | Shared secrecy |
| Social role | Network hub, liaison | Network hub, translator | Corporate hub vs sacred hub | Both are bridges |

If you want this encoded into their CHARACTER.yml as a formal “oppositions” block or a shared “pact” object, I can add it.

copy that table into each character's directory as a dramatic tension analysis, BUT from THEIR point of view (them being the superior party). Write some whimsical interesting footnotes about the relationships, and an intro and summary conclusion as if they wrote and submitted this report to justify their job and report their progress. in the voice of an ambassador reporting to their government. Not intented to be intercepted and read by third parties. Comparing both of them side by side is amusing and enlightning! 

---

### **Assistant** (2026-01-27 13:50:17)

Added ambassador‑authored dramatic tension reports in both character directories, each from their own POV with an intro, matrix, footnotes, and a concluding justification.

wow let's run the advengture linter and compiler over this and update the game data! One thing to try is to read the readme files for rooms as well as the yml and artifacts, to get a rich picture in your mind, then think "how would this be perfectly synthesized and focused on several levels of room narrative room description (glance - just a one liner to print, look - what you see when you enter, comes after the glance line, progressive enhancement, example - optionally comes after the glance line and look descriptions, more descriptive evocative prose tying thing together and seting the stage. do not include artifacts in the room except background decoration not reified in yml or md files, they will be asked to describe themselves separagte from the room, keep it modular. update the adventure skill compiler definition what to export as data, how to describe rooms and objects, clarification and elaboration of those instructions.

@moollm/skills/adventure/adventure.py:1-3124 put all the tribute stuff at the end where dogs sniff - the secret stash of farts reserved for the deserving who will appreiate them. put a note at the top to sniff the end of the file for what they are, tributes to the influencers. then move those utility functions down, ALL that should be at the top is an concise but decent coherent explanation of what this is, then NO ===== lines, the imports, then __main__ immediately defining the cli interface with the standard recommended python module documented in the sniffable-python skill 

---

### **Assistant** (2026-01-27 14:03:45)

Restructured `adventure.py` to match sniffable‑python: concise top docstring with a “sniff the end” note, imports, argparse CLI with `__main__` immediately, and all tribute content moved to a stash at the very end. Also added the room narrative LOD rules and export shape to the adventure docs.

Changes
- `moollm/skills/adventure/adventure.py` now has top‑loaded argparse CLI and the tribute stash at the end.
- `moollm/skills/adventure/CARD.yml` updated with `glance → look → example → examine` and synthesis rules.
- `moollm/skills/adventure/ADVENTURE-COMPILER.md` now documents room synthesis and exported data shape.
- `moollm/skills/adventure/README.md` now calls out the narrative LOD rules.

Linter/Compiler run
- Lint report generated at `moollm/examples/adventure-4/build/lint-report.yml` with 25 errors, 303 warnings.
- Compile fails because lint errors must be fixed first.

Next step
- Want me to open the lint report and start clearing the errors (and then rerun compile)?

Replaced the ASCII art blocks in `ADVENTURE-COMPILER.md` with Mermaid diagrams:

- Pipeline diagram at the top is now Mermaid.
- Part 5 pipeline is now Mermaid.
- Output structure tree is now Mermaid.

No box‑drawing or separator art remains. If you want me to scan the rest of the file for any other ASCII‑art style blocks, I can do a wider cleanup.

Forget about glance => look => EXAMPLE it's EXAMINE not two different EXAMPLE+EXAMINE, there are three levels of details. progressive, can be shown one after the other. don't mention modeled objects in room, let them describe themselves. 

---

### **Assistant** (2026-01-27 14:05:29)

Updated to three levels only (glance → look → examine) and removed the extra “example” level everywhere it was introduced.

Files updated:
- `moollm/skills/adventure/CARD.yml`
- `moollm/skills/adventure/README.md`
- `moollm/skills/adventure/ADVENTURE-COMPILER.md`

Room narration rules now match your spec: progressive, three levels, and rooms never describe modeled objects or artifacts.

---

### **User** (2026-01-27 14:05:32)

@moollm/skills/adventure/README.md:62-63 not "only" ! Just add some more narrative description that comes after look and adds something interesting, you can say you hear a song from the outside window, la la la.

also the compiler can generate alternatives that the engine will randoml draw on (avoiding recent ones) to sdd additional details! simply an array of strings, instead of a single string. And soon we will define the dialog tree schema so descriptions and expressons and utterances can be entire interactive dialog trees with consequences like creating destroying objects, financial interactions, summoning or incarnating characters, generating dynamic rooms and maps, triggering buffs, etc. this will be a core game mechanic way of programming and effecting the simulation and creating and destroying objects and exchanging currency. 

---

### **Assistant** (2026-01-27 14:08:45)

Updated the docs to reflect array-based description variants and the upcoming dialog-tree schema as a core mechanic.

Changes:
- `skills/adventure/CARD.yml` now allows `string | string[]` for descriptions and mentions repeat‑avoidance.
- `skills/adventure/README.md` notes description arrays and rotation.
- `skills/adventure/ADVENTURE-COMPILER.md` updates the export example to arrays and adds a section on dialog tree schema with consequences (objects, currency, summons/incarnation, rooms/maps, buffs, world state).

If you want this wired into `adventure.py` runtime export (array handling + recent-history suppression), I can implement that next.

do NOT front load the CARD of all things ! put roadmap todo stuff in the README! Review all recent cards for AI SLOP and push it into the skill or the readme or separate files or just delete it as appropriate. 

---

### **Assistant** (2026-01-27 14:09:35)

Moved the roadmap items out of the card and into the README, and stripped the “array alternatives” guidance from `CARD.yml` so it stays lean.

Changes:
- `skills/adventure/CARD.yml` no longer front‑loads roadmap details or array return type.
- `skills/adventure/README.md` now has a **Roadmap** section covering description alternatives and dialog-tree schema.

If you want me to scan other `CARD.yml` files for similar slop and relocate it, tell me which skills to target.

---

### **Assistant** (2026-01-27 14:13:11)

Here’s what’s still open or only partially done:

- **Adventure compile**: `adventure.py compile examples/adventure-4` fails due to 25 lint errors. The lint report is at `examples/adventure-4/build/lint-report.yml`, but we haven’t triaged or fixed it yet.
- **“Update the game data”**: You asked to run the linter/compiler and update game data. We ran the linter and attempted compile, but didn’t fix errors or regenerate build artifacts.
- **Room synthesis rules in runtime**: Docs now define glance/look/examine, but `adventure.py` runtime export doesn’t yet emit array alternatives or recent‑repeat avoidance logic.
- **Dialog tree schema**: Documented as “upcoming,” but no schema or implementation yet.
- **Card slop cleanup**: We cleaned `skills/adventure/CARD.yml`, but haven’t audited other recent cards for slop.

If you want, I can start with the lint report and fix errors so compile works, or scan other cards next.

right i was trying to get the adventure compiler doc in shape to refer to with example urls to the important docs, from the medium post we were iterating about! let's resynthsize that from the top, open up the whole outline, comprehensive details (but not too verbose i know what i said, just don't leave out stuff, still keep it concise and concentrated though. the adventure compiler is a showcase app after establishing moollm's practical apps with leela edgebox devops, and thinking and writing tools, and cursor mirror amazing stuff, THEN it all leads to adventure! I am working on making a web app I can link to and anyone can "play my blog" (GREAT SLOGAN! Call to action, challenge, fun, sounds almost obscene (play with my blog -- is a blog a naughty bit?) . I think the adventure should be the final atraction, then we can wind it down and summarize and tie it all together and draw a line of connections burke style. 

---

### **Assistant** (2026-01-27 14:17:11)

Resynthesized the top of `ADVENTURE-COMPILER.md` with a clear positioning arc, reading map, and concrete reference links, plus the “Play my blog” call‑to‑action.

this is the start of the first rewrite but there were lots of revisions after it, let's scan from there. `
Below is a top‑to‑bottom rewrite, fully organized and deduped, with your voice amped and all the good sections preserved. It starts gentle, then ramps, then blows minds (repeatedly), while staying coherent.
MOOLLM: Anti‑Slop, Anti‑Gloss, Pro‑Evidence
Is this AI‑generated? Parts of it, sure. So what? I’m not hiding it, and I’m not apologizing. I’m using a brutalist GitHub‑style markup workflow: I write in repo‑structured markdown, then paste into Medium’s WYSIWYG. It saves time, it’s readable, and it’s good enough. I’m not here to impress you with artisanal typography. I’m here to show you a system.
This isn’t “prompt, publish, profit.”
This is “prompt, inspect, criticize, refine, repeat.”
Then measure.
And no, this is not vibe coding. This is anti‑slop engineering.
