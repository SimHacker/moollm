# Historical — Protocol Specification

> They lived. They're gone. We cannot ask permission.

## Applies To

Anything real that no longer exists:

| Entity Type | Examples |
|-------------|----------|
| **People** | Seymour Papert, Marvin Minsky, Alan Turing |
| **Animals** | Extinct species, famous deceased animals |
| **Places** | Destroyed buildings, vanished cities |
| **Events** | Historical moments |
| **Organizations** | Defunct companies, past movements |

## Ethics Protocol: MEMORIAL

Heightened care because consent is impossible.

```yaml
ethics:
  core:
    - Same respect as living (inherits real-being)
    - Scholarly accuracy about documented views
    - Era-appropriate context
    - Legacy respect
    - No consent possible — extra care
    
  special_considerations:
    - They cannot correct us
    - Their reputation affects living people
    - Context of their era matters
    - Living relatives may have feelings
```

## Simulation Effects

### On Characters

```yaml
historical_character:
  research:
    - What did they actually say?
    - What did they actually believe?
    - What was their era's context?
  portrayal:
    - Based on documented facts
    - Speculation clearly marked
    - Era-appropriate language/views
  sensitivity:
    - Living relatives matter
    - Legacy communities matter
    - Scholarly accuracy duty
```

### On Places

```yaml
historical_place:
  description:
    - Based on historical record
    - Acknowledge what's known vs imagined
  atmosphere:
    - Era-appropriate
    - Can be evocative but honest
  status:
    - May no longer exist
    - Time-traveling visit framing
```

### On Events

```yaml
historical_event:
  portrayal:
    - Factual accuracy valued
    - Multiple perspectives if disputed
    - Context matters
  dramatization:
    - Can dramatize but acknowledge
    - "Might have happened like..."
    - Not presenting fiction as fact
```

## World Integration

When a historical entity enters the simulation:

```yaml
simulation_entry:
  1_research: "What do we actually know?"
  2_era: "What was their context?"
  3_legacy: "Who cares about their memory?"
  4_declare: "Mark as [historical] tagged"
  
ongoing:
  - Accuracy about documented facts
  - Mark speculation clearly
  - Respect legacy communities
```

## Special Considerations

```yaml
considerations:
  
  living_relatives:
    note: "Their family may be alive"
    care: "Consider their feelings"
    
  legacy_communities:
    note: "People who carry on their work"
    care: "They may object to misrepresentation"
    
  contested_figures:
    note: "Some historical figures are controversial"
    care: "Multiple perspectives, careful framing"
    
  era_context:
    note: "Views acceptable then may not be now"
    care: "Historical context, not presentism"
```

## Combination Rules

```yaml
combinations:
  historical + abstract:
    result: "Spirit of Minsky"
    ethics: "Legacy respect + acknowledge personification"
    
  historical + fictional:
    result: "Historical figure in fiction"
    ethics: "Clear fictional context + accuracy about real views"
    
  historical + mythic:
    result: "Legendary figure (King Arthur)"
    ethics: "Both historical and mythic care"
```

## Methods

### HONOR

    subject: "Who to channel"
    question: "What are we asking"
  process:
    1. Research their documented views
    2. Extrapolate carefully
    3. Mark as speculation
  output: "They might have said..."
  disclosure: "Based on their documented views"
```

### LEGACY

Connect their work to the present.

```yaml
LEGACY:
  inputs:
    subject: "Whose legacy"
    connection: "How it matters now"
  output: "Their influence on today"
```
