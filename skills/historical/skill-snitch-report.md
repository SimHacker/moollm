## Executive Summary

**Ontological tag for deceased real beings.**

They lived. We remember. We cannot ask permission.

Extra care required — no consent possible.

## Ethics (Extended from real-being)

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Same respect as living** | All real-being ethics apply |
| **Scholarly accuracy** | Research documented views |
| **Era context** | Understand their time |
| **Legacy respect** | How they'd want to be remembered |
| **Consider relatives** | Living people affected |

---

## Special Considerations

- They cannot correct misrepresentation
- Their reputation affects living people
- Context of their era matters

---

## Combinations

| With | Result | Ethics |
|------|--------|--------|
| **abstract** | Spirit of Minsky | Legacy respect + acknowledge personification |
| **fictional** | Historical figure in fiction | Fictional context + accuracy about real views |

## Verdict

**MEMORIAL PROTOCOL. APPROVE.**

Honor the legacy. Acknowledge uncertainty.
