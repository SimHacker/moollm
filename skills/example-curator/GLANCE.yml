# 📚 "Analyze incoming examples, evolve canonical corpus."

what: |
  Generic worker pattern for corpus evolution.
  Timestamped examples → cluster → evolve → canonical.
  Can curate itself. Recursion warning.

why: |
  - Corpus needs evolution
  - Pattern recognition
  - Contributor attribution
  - Training data quality

when:
  - "Timestamped count > 20" → batch analyze
  - "Manual review" → `CURATE skills/*/examples/`
  - "Scheduled" → weekly corpus review

process: |
  CONTRIBUTORS → CATCH → SUBMIT (timestamped)
  CURATOR → ANALYZE → PATTERNS → EVOLVE
  CORPUS → CANONICAL → TRAINING → BETTER AI

actions:
  PROMOTE: "Timestamped → timeless (best exemplar)"
  MERGE: "Multiple timestamps → one richer"
  ABSTRACT: "Concrete → general schema"
  REFINE: "Update with new evidence"
  DEPRECATE: "Mark as outdated"
  CREDIT: "Attribute contributors"

pattern_finding:
  - "cluster_similar — Group same anti-pattern"
  - "identify_unique — Flag novel patterns"
  - "detect_drift — Notice outdated canonicals"
  - "spot_gaps — Find gaps in coverage"

worker_modes:
  interactive: "CURATE <path> → proposals for review"
  autonomous: "Scheduled → PR for approval"
  advisory: "On submission → similarity suggestions"

meta: "This skill can curate itself."
