# 🎞️ "The camera is the pickaxe. The slideshow is the museum."

what: |
  Present images as linear visual narratives.
  Visualizer CREATES. Slideshow PRESENTS.
  Stereo: YML (truth) + MD (narrative) = depth.

why: |
  - GitHub-displayable galleries
  - Full EXIF simulation
  - Versioning with dreaming
  - Backstory mining

when:
  - "Images need gallery" → CREATE
  - "GitHub landing" → LANDING
  - "YML changed" → SYNC
  - "New images" → UPDATE

stereo_pattern: |
  LEFT EYE: SLIDESHOW.yml (machine truth)
  RIGHT EYE: SLIDESHOW.md (human narrative)
  Depth perception from parallax.

methods:
  CREATE: "Make SLIDESHOW.md"
  LANDING: "Create README.md"
  SYNC: "Regenerate MD from YML"
  UPDATE: "Add new images"
  ORGANIZE: "Move to named subdirectory"

versioning: |
  Primary: no-timestamp.png (canonical)
  Versioned: 2026-01-25-image.png (historical)
  Mine: image-mine.yml (accumulates across ALL)
  The mine forgets no face.

yes_and_protocol: |
  Show existing mine → Add UNIQUE observations
  Don't contradict → Build layers
  composition → mood → symbolism → connections

backstory_layers:
  temporal: "What happened before?"
  spatial: "Beyond the frame?"
  characters: "Connected but not shown?"
  sessions: "Play history connections?"
  artifact: "Story of THIS IMAGE?"
