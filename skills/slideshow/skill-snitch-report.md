# Skill Snitch Report: slideshow

**Date:** 2026-01-28  
**Auditor:** Deep Probe  
**Verdict:** THE CAMERA IS THE PICKAXE. THE SLIDESHOW IS THE MUSEUM.

---

## Executive Summary

**Present images in linear narrative form.**

Visualizer CREATES. Slideshow PRESENTS.

Stereo vision: YML (truth) + MD (narrative) = depth perception.

---

## The Stereo Pattern

| Eye | File | Purpose |
|-----|------|---------|
| **Left** | SLIDESHOW.yml | Machine-readable source of truth |
| **Right** | SLIDESHOW.md | Human-readable narrative for GitHub |

Together they provide depth perception.

---

## Methods

| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **CREATE** | Make SLIDESHOW.md for images |
| **LANDING** | Create README.md for GitHub display |
| **SYNC** | Regenerate MD from YML |
| **UPDATE** | Add new images |
| **ORGANIZE** | Move into named subdirectory |

---

## Simulated Photography Metadata

Full EXIF simulation:
- Camera body (make, model, sensor)
- Lens (focal length, aperture, filter)
- Exposure (mode, aperture, shutter, ISO)
- Film simulation (grain, color profile)
- Lighting conditions
- GPS/location
- Post-processing

Even AI images get "camera metadata."

## Versioning: The Dreaming Pattern

| Type | Pattern |
|------|---------|
| **Primary** | `no-timestamp.png` — canonical now |
| **Versioned** | `2026-01-25-19-30-00-image.png` — historical |
| **Mine** | `image-mine.yml` — accumulates across ALL versions |

The mine forgets no face. It dreams of all of them.

---

## YES AND Protocol

When mining:
- Show existing mine content
- Only add NEW observations
- Don't contradict — build on
- Layer by layer: composition → mood → symbolism → connections

---

## Backstory Layers

| Layer | Question |
|-------|----------|
| **Temporal** | What happened before? (minutes/hours/years ago) |
| **Spatial** | What's beyond the frame? |
| **Characters** | Who's connected but not shown? |
| **Sessions** | How does this connect to play history? |
| **Artifact** | What's the story of THIS IMAGE? |

---

## Security Assessment

### Concerns

1. **File proliferation** — many sidecars
2. **Metadata overload** — too much EXIF
3. **Dream accumulation** — mine grows forever

### Mitigations

- Organized directories
- Simulated EXIF is optional
- Dreams are features not bugs

**Risk Level:** LOW — presentation layer

---

## Verdict

**MUSEUM FOR YOUR IMAGES. APPROVE.**

Visualizer creates. Slideshow presents.

The mine dreams across all versions.
