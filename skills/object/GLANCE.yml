# 📦 "An interactable thing in the world."

what: |
  The fundamental interactable primitive.
  Keys, lamps, chests, furniture — all objects.
  Tags for filtering. Methods for actions. Advertisements for autonomy.

why: |
  - Define world interactables
  - Enable autonomous agent behavior
  - Support containers and inventory
  - Simulate dynamic state per turn

when:
  - "Create item" → object with tags
  - "Add behavior" → methods
  - "Autonomous action" → advertisements
  - "Dynamic updates" → simulate

schema:
  required: [id, name, description]
  optional: [tags, state, methods, simulate, advertisements, container, locked, hidden]
  compiled: [simulate_js, methods_js.*, advertisements.*.guard_js, advertisements.*.effect_js]

common_tags:
  - "weapon, food, drink, container"
  - "light-source, tool, treasure, readable"
  - "wearable, consumable, magical"
  - "fragile, heavy, key"

methods: |
  Named behaviors in natural language.
  Compile to closures: methods_js.*, methods_py.*

advertisements: |
  Actions the object offers to autonomous agents.
  score + guard + effect
  Highest-scoring valid ad wins.

simulate: |
  Per-turn update in natural language.
  Compiles to closure, runs each tick.

hidden_uses:
  - "Prototypes (templates, not in world)"
  - "Agents (invisible actors)"
  - "Tasks (meta-objects)"

containers: |
  container: true + capacity + contains
  Objects can hold objects.
