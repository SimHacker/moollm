# GLANCE.yml — skill-snitch
# Full file: CARD.yml (109 lines) | SKILL.md
# 🔍 Security auditing for MOOLLM skills

what: |
  Static analysis + runtime surveillance for skills.
  Detects undeclared tools, path escapes, secrets, exfiltration.
  Composes with cursor-mirror for runtime tracing.

why: |
  - Audit skill before trusting it
  - Detect suspicious patterns (secrets, shell escapes)
  - Verify skill files match (INDEX ↔ CARD ↔ SKILL.md ↔ code)
  - Track what a skill ACTUALLY did vs what it claimed

when:
  - "Is this skill safe? → SCAN, AUDIT"
  - "What did it actually do? → SNITCH (runtime)"
  - "Should I trust it? → TRUST"
  - "Files consistent? → CONSISTENCY"

methods:
  SCAN: "Quick static scan"
  AUDIT: "Deep pattern matching"
  SNITCH: "Runtime surveillance via cursor-mirror"
  TRUST: "Combined static + runtime assessment"
  CONSISTENCY: "Check INDEX ↔ CARD ↔ SKILL.md ↔ code"
