# EXPORTS.yml — Skill Snitch

# skill-snitch is bundled WITH cursor-mirror, not standalone.
# This file documents its role in the bundle.

  # skill-snitch is NOT distributed standalone

  reason: |
    skill-snitch's SNITCH method (runtime surveillance) depends on
    cursor-mirror's deep-snitch command. The two skills have a
    bidirectional relationship and must ship together.

      reason: "SNITCH method uses cursor-mirror deep-snitch for runtime surveillance"
      
  optional:
