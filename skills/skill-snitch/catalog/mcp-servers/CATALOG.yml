  note: "MCP servers are plumbing, not skills. Interesting for how MOOLLM entities could expose themselves as MCP servers."

entries:
  - server: filesystem
    lang: TypeScript
    lines: 1400
    tools: 14
    trust: green
    summary: "Gold standard security engineering. Symlink defense, atomic writes, null byte rejection, path containment."
    moollm_relevance: "Template for how adventure/room could expose filesystem operations as MCP tools"

  - server: git
    lang: Python
    lines: 500
    tools: 12
    trust: yellow
    summary: "Git operations via gitpython. Flag injection defense. Without --repository flag, accesses any repo."
    moollm_relevance: "github skill already wraps gh/git CLI — this is the MCP equivalent"

  - server: memory
    lang: TypeScript
    lines: 430
    tools: 9
    trust: green
    summary: "Persistent knowledge graph in JSONL. Entities, relations, observations. Minimal deps."
    moollm_relevance: "Closest to MOOLLM's memory-palace/room/container model. JSONL graph = rooms + links."

  - server: time
    lang: Python
    lines: 230
    tools: 2
    trust: green
    summary: "Pure computation. Zero side effects. Get current time, convert between timezones."
    moollm_relevance: "Trivial but clean reference. MOOLLM's time skill is richer."

  - server: fetch
    lang: Python
    lines: 330
    tools: 1
    trust: yellow
    summary: "Arbitrary URL fetch with robots.txt compliance. SSRF risk — no internal network filtering."
    moollm_relevance: "FETCH-SCAN uses similar pattern. The SSRF concern applies to skill-snitch too."

  - server: everything
    lang: TypeScript
    lines: 800
    tools: 18
    trust: blue
    summary: "Test harness exercising ALL MCP features. get_env tool exposes environment variables."
    moollm_relevance: "Reference for what a full-featured MOOLLM-as-MCP-server would look like"
    advisory: "get_env exposes secrets in env vars — never run in production"

  - server: sequentialthinking
    lang: TypeScript
    lines: 225
    tools: 1
    trust: green
    summary: "Append-only thought chain with branching and revision. Zero side effects."
    moollm_relevance: "Similar to scratchpad skill — working memory for chain-of-thought"
