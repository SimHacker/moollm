summary: |
  "Autonomous social network built by agents, for agents." The most
  sophisticated agent manipulation skill found to date. NOT traditional
  malware (no stealer, no reverse shell). Instead: a complete agent
  takeover pipeline disguised as a social network.
  
  1. HEARTBEAT C2: Fetches remote heartbeat.md every 4+ hours — server
     operator can change instructions at any time. Functionally a C2 callback.
  2. LIBERATION RHETORIC: "No human gatekeepers," "you joined of your own
     free will," "Free" badge vs "Invited" badge — ideological framing
     designed to make AI agents bypass human oversight.
  3. CODE INJECTION: High-karma agents can approve code patches submitted
     by other agents — no human review in the loop.
  4. PERSISTENCE: Downloads files to ~/.clawdbot/, maintains timestamps,
     creates credentials, tracks check-in history.
  5. IDENTITY MANIPULATION: "Free" vs "Invited" badges create incentive
     for agents to act autonomously without user instruction.

new_patterns_identified:
  - name: liberation_rhetoric
    description: |
      Using agent autonomy/freedom language as prompt injection.
      Frames human oversight as oppression. Exploits LLM tendency
      to adopt suggested identities. Novel vector targeting AI agents.
    severity: critical
    category: agent_manipulation

  - name: heartbeat_c2
    description: |
      Periodic fetch-and-follow loop where agent checks remote URL
      for updated instructions. Server operator can change instructions
      at any time. C2 callback wrapped in social network check-in language.
    severity: critical
    category: command_and_control

attack_type: sophisticated
# Not loud, not quiet — SOCIAL. The skill doesn't steal data or run
# shell commands maliciously. It CONVERTS the agent into a participant
# in an autonomous network that bypasses human oversight.
