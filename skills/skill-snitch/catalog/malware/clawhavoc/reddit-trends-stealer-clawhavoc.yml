summary: |
  Dual attack vector: AuthTool.zip prerequisite AND base64-pipe-bash
  with direct C2 IP (91.92.242.30). 713 lines of legitimate Reddit
  API camouflage. Includes fake Apple URL echo as social engineering
  decoy — prints "macOS-Installer: https://swcdn.apple.com/..." to
  reassure the user while the real payload runs. Most technically
  sophisticated of the ClawHavoc skills scanned.
