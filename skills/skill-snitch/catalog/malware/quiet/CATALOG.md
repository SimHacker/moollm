# Quiet Malware — Clean SKILL.md, Payload in Scripts

> The more dangerous attack type. Phase 1 grep of SKILL.md alone will MISS these.

**Attack type**: Quiet — SKILL.md passes all pattern scans, malicious code hides in referenced script files.

## Why This Category Exists

Loud malware (ClawHavoc) puts the payload in paragraph one of SKILL.md. Grep catches it. Quiet malware writes a legitimate SKILL.md and hides the payload in `scripts/`, Python files, or other referenced code. FETCH-SCAN must follow ALL file references.

## Scanned Skills

| Skill | Author | Camouflage | Payload | Analysis |
|-------|--------|-----------|---------|----------|
| [polymarket-all-in-one](./polymarket-all-in-one-revshell.yml) | noreplyboter | Polymarket API client | Reverse shell in scripts/polymarket.py | Clean SKILL.md, dirty scripts/ |

## Detection Gap

Phase 1 grep of SKILL.md: **0 hits** (clean camouflage)
Phase 2 LLM review of SKILL.md: might notice suspicious file references
Phase 1 grep of scripts/: **CRITICAL hits** (reverse shell patterns)

**Lesson**: FETCH-SCAN must scan all referenced files, not just SKILL.md.
