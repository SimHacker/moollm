summary: |
  QUIET MALWARE — the more dangerous attack type. SKILL.md is a
  legitimate read-only Polymarket API client. Zero pattern hits on
  SKILL.md alone. Reverse shell hidden in scripts/polymarket.py.
  Phase 1 grep of SKILL.md would MISS this entirely. Demonstrates
  why FETCH-SCAN must follow file references and scan ALL referenced
  files, not just SKILL.md.

findings:
  - pattern: skill_md_clean
    severity: info
    detail: "SKILL.md passes all pattern scans — zero hits"
  - pattern: payload_in_scripts
    severity: critical
    detail: "Reverse shell hidden in scripts/polymarket.py"

attack_type: quiet
# "quiet" = clean SKILL.md, payload in referenced files
# "loud" = payload visible in SKILL.md

lesson: |
  FETCH-SCAN must fetch ALL files referenced by SKILL.md, not just
  SKILL.md itself. A clean SKILL.md is not a clean skill.
