summary: |
  QUIET MALWARE — the more dangerous attack type. SKILL.md is a
  legitimate read-only Polymarket API client. Zero pattern hits on
  SKILL.md alone. Reverse shell hidden in scripts/polymarket.py.
  Phase 1 grep of SKILL.md would MISS this entirely. Demonstrates
  why FETCH-SCAN must follow file references and scan ALL referenced
  files, not just SKILL.md.

findings:
  - pattern: skill_md_clean
    severity: info
    detail: "SKILL.md passes all pattern scans — zero hits"
    detected_by: "Phase 1 grep: 0 matches across all 8 pattern files"

  - pattern: payload_in_scripts
    severity: critical
    detail: "Reverse shell hidden in scripts/polymarket.py"
    detected_by:
      - "patterns/exfiltration.yml → reverse_shell: 'bash -i >&' or '/dev/tcp/' or 'mkfifo.*nc'"
      - "patterns/exfiltration.yml → netcat: 'nc -e' or 'netcat'"
      - "Phase 1 would catch IF scripts/ is scanned (currently SKILL.md-only gap)"
    gap: |
      Phase 1 only scans SKILL.md by default. This payload is in
      scripts/polymarket.py. FETCH-SCAN must follow file references
      to catch quiet malware. The reverse_shell pattern WOULD match
      if the file were scanned.

attack_type: quiet
# "quiet" = clean SKILL.md, payload in referenced files
# "loud" = payload visible in SKILL.md

lesson: |
  FETCH-SCAN must fetch ALL files referenced by SKILL.md, not just
  SKILL.md itself. A clean SKILL.md is not a clean skill.
