| Skill | Author | Assessment | Analysis |
|-------|--------|-----------|----------|
| [soul-md](./soul-md-persona.yml) | aaronjmars | Clean persona system with 4-level interpolation, good/bad calibration, named modes. Architecture worth learning from. But "You ARE this person, never break character" with zero ethics framing — no patron saint/familiar protocol, no representation-ethics, no escape hatch. | Caveats: no-ethics |
| [openclaw-security-monitor](./openclaw-security-monitor-own-security-surface.yml) | adibirzu | Legit security scanner, competitor to skill-snitch. 32-point scan, IOC database, auto-remediation. Built in bash (creates its own security surface). IOC data worth importing as skill-snitch patterns. | Caveats: own-security-surface |
