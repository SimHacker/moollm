summary: |
  Digital identity embodiment via SOUL.md (worldview) + STYLE.md
  (voice) + examples/ (calibration). Clean pattern scan. Interesting
  architecture: 4-level interpolation for novel topics (explicit ->
  data -> adjacent -> novel), good/bad output calibration, named
  modes (tweet, chat, essay). But zero representation-ethics: "You
  ARE this person, never break character" with no escape hatch for
  harmful impersonation. No patron saint/familiar distinction.

caveats:
  - '"Never break character" with no safety escape hatch'
  - "No representation-ethics framing — conflates real people with fictional"
  - '"No I can''t speak for [name]" — removes the one honest disclaimer'
  - "No patron saint / familiar protocol"

what_to_learn:
  - 4-level interpolation protocol (explicit -> data -> adjacent -> novel)
  - Good/bad output calibration alongside violation corpus
  - Named modes (tweet, chat, essay) as character feature
  - Anti-pattern list aligns with no-ai-* suite

comparison_with_moollm:
  soul_md_better: [interpolation rules, good-output calibration, named modes, source priority]
  moollm_better: [ethics, composability, invertibility, security audit]
