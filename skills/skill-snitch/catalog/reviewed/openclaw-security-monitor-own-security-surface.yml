summary: |
  OpenClaw ecosystem's answer to skill-snitch. 32-point security
  scanner. IOC database with ClawHavoc C2 IPs, malicious publisher
  list, file hashes. Auto-remediation. Web dashboard on port 18800.
  Telegram alerts. 17+ security research sources. The architecture
  is bash scripts (not prompt-driven like skill-snitch), which creates
  its own security surface: 32 bash scripts that can modify system
  config, LaunchAgent install, daily cron scan.

findings:
  - pattern: bash_script_execution
    severity: medium
    detail: "32+ bash scripts in scripts/ directory"
  - pattern: system_modification
    severity: medium
    detail: "--yes auto-approve remediation modifies system config"
  - pattern: launchagent_install
    severity: medium
    detail: "Installs LaunchAgent for web dashboard"
  - pattern: cron_install
    severity: low
    detail: "Daily security scan at 06:00 UTC"

comparison_with_skill_snitch:
  theirs: "Bash scripts, hardcoded patterns, auto-remediation, web dashboard"
  ours: "Prompt-driven, YAML-extensible patterns, report-only, no code execution"
  ioc_import: "Their ioc/ directory has C2 IPs, domains, hashes, publisher lists worth importing"
