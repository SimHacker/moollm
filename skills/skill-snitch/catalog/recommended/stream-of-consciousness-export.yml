summary: |
  Exports entire conversation context into Open-Token format (JSON/NDJSON).
  Well-specified schema (v0.1) with redaction (secrets/PII/strict),
  integrity hashing, truncation rules, subagent spans. Pure documentation
  skill — tells the LLM how to format output, no execution. First
  approval candidate, recommended for adoption.

findings:
  - pattern: all_patterns
    severity: clean
    detail: "Zero hits. Pure documentation skill with no execution surface."

quality:
  documentation: excellent
  schema_design: thorough (versioned, extensible, edge cases handled)
  security_surface: none (pure output formatting)
  provenance: good (single-purpose, well-scoped)
  innovation: high (portable conversation format with built-in redaction)

what_makes_it_good:
  - Handles missing data honestly ("DO NOT fabricate missing turns")
  - Built-in redaction for secrets, PII, strict mode
  - Integrity hashing for tamper detection
  - Subagent span support
  - Both JSON and NDJSON streaming modes
  - No extraneous text outside the export payload

moollm_integration:
  potential: high
  ideas:
    - Complement cursor-mirror's export-markdown with structured JSON
    - Inform thoughtful-commitment's commit metadata format
    - Portable session handoff between orchestrators (Cursor → MOOCO)
    - Audit trail format for skill-snitch runtime reports
    - The redaction rules align with trekify's privacy masking
