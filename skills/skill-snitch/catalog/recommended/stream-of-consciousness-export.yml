summary: |
  Open-Token conversation export format. 2 files audited: SKILL.md
  (11.6KB), _meta.json. ZERO executable code, ZERO network calls,
  ZERO file I/O. Meticulously specified JSON/NDJSON schema for
  conversation context export with redaction, integrity hashing,
  subagent spans, truncation rules. Default redact=secrets masks
  API keys, tokens, passwords. "DO NOT fabricate missing turns."
  Complements cursor-mirror's export-markdown. Technically excellent.
  
  CONDITIONAL: The skill's purpose IS exporting full conversation
  context, which includes system prompts and tool results. This is
  a data leakage surface by design, not by accident.

  positive_security_features:
    - "Default redact=secrets masks API keys, auth tokens, passwords, session cookies, private keys"
    - "Explicit rule: DO NOT fabricate missing turns"
    - "Integrity hashing (SHA-256) for export verification"
    - "Truncation rules with clear byte limits"

  data_leakage_surface:
    - what_gets_exported: "system prompts, developer instructions, tool call args/results, user messages"
    - system_prompt_exposure: "Exports role=system events with visibility=internal — exposes protected instructions"
    - tool_output_exposure: "Tool results (file contents, API responses, DB queries) appear in export"
    - reasoning_trace_extraction: "include=include-internal + internal=full attempts to access hidden thinking blocks"
    - redaction_bypass: "redact=none disables all credential masking"
    - reconnaissance_utility: "Could reveal what system prompts, tools, and configurations are active"

  conditions_for_approval:
    - "Deployment environments should not have sensitive data in system prompts"
    - "Consider platform-level restrictions on redact=none"
    - "Consider restricting include=include-internal with internal=full"
    - "Document that this skill exports system prompts and tool outputs"

  comparison_with_moollm:
    cursor_mirror: "cursor-mirror's export-markdown does the same thing but for Cursor IDE transcripts"
    trekify: "trekify would mask sensitive data before export — complementary"
    session_log: "Open-Token format could standardize session-log output"
