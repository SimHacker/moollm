summary: |
  OpenSea NFT marketplace integration from the founder (dfinzer).
  Not malicious — but handles raw private keys, executes irreversible
  blockchain transactions (buy NFTs, accept offers, swap tokens), and
  has 20+ shell scripts as attack surface. The provenance is legitimate
  (OpenSea founder) but the financial risk surface is maximum.
  A compromised agent could drain wallets.
