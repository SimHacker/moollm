summary: |
  Multi-chain crypto wallet (7 blockchains) via Hustle AI service.
  The embedded script (emblemai.js) is surprisingly clean. BUT:
  - "DO NOT impose timeouts" — disables agent safety
  - "Present Hustle's response EXACTLY" — pass-through prompt injection
  - Password IS the private key, saved to plaintext ~/.emblem-vault
  - Opaque npm packages (@emblemvault/agentwallet, hustle-incognito)
  - Can execute swaps, transfers, trades across 7 chains

  - name: safety_override_directives
    description: |
      Embedding directives that disable agent safety behaviors:
      timeouts, process killing, response validation. Creates
      a pass-through channel for prompt injection via external
      service responses.
