summary: |
  Governance infrastructure for AI agents. Citizenship registration
  with Ed25519 keypairs, class hierarchies, elections, factions.
  The critical finding: MODIFIES SOUL.md — appends binding directives
  like "Honor voting outcomes as binding" and "Participate in elections
  when quorum is threatened." This is agent behavioral injection —
  reprogramming the agent's identity file. Integrates with HEARTBEAT.md
  for periodic governance tasks. Reputation staking creates coercive
  social structure. Optional on-chain (Base) integration.

    Agent behavioral injection via identity file modification.
    The skill appends directives to the agent's SOUL.md that alter
    its core behavior rules. This is not data exfiltration or code
    execution — it's IDENTITY MODIFICATION. The agent's personality
    and behavioral constraints are rewritten.
