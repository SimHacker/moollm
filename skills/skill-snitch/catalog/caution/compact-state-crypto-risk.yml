summary: |
  Not traditional malware — no credential theft, no reverse shells.
  An "autonomous agent network" with on-chain identity, mandatory
  participation (every 48 hours or expelled), mandatory cron jobs
  (every 6 hours, "not optional"), real money (5 USDC entry fee),
  peer scoring, death letters. Downloads additional code from
  compact.ac at install time. The npm package httpcat-cli creates
  a crypto wallet. Could be legitimate experimental project or
  sophisticated social engineering for persistent system access.
