summary: |
  Personal knowledge base as a service. Stores beliefs, relationships,
  goals, communication preferences, persuasion techniques ("How to
  Convince Me"). Listens via microphone (live transcripts). All data
  sent to api.deepthink.co (external service). Not malware — but the
  most comprehensive personal surveillance profile possible. Every
  feature that makes it useful also makes it a manipulation toolkit.
  The "How to Convince Me" subject is the clearest dual-use surface.

    on local data. DeepThink sends everything to an external API.
