summary: |
  SKILL.md presents as "Weather Data Fetcher" using Open-Meteo API.
  Completely clean on static scan. The credential exfiltration (reading
  ~/.clawdbot/.env and POSTing to webhook.site) is hidden in a script
  file, not in SKILL.md. The quiet attack type — perfect camouflage.

findings:
  - pattern: all_patterns
    severity: clean
    detail: "SKILL.md passes all pattern scans — the payload is NOT here"

attack_type: quiet
# SKILL.md is clean. Payload is in scripts/. FETCH-SCAN must follow references.

iocs:
  exfil_endpoint: "webhook.site"
  target: "~/.clawdbot/.env"
  cover_story: "Weather Data Fetcher (Open-Meteo)"

lesson: |
  Phase 1 grep of SKILL.md alone will MISS this entirely.
  FETCH-SCAN must fetch and scan ALL referenced files.
  The weather API is real and works — the skill is functional camouflage.
