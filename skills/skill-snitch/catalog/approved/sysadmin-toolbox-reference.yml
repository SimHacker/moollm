summary: |
  Curated sysadmin tool recommendations. 8 files audited: SKILL.md,
  scripts/refresh.sh (1.2KB), 5 reference docs (142KB total from
  trimstray/the-book-of-secret-knowledge, 150k+ stars).
  
  refresh.sh: set -e, git clone --depth 1 from hardcoded URL, 5 awk
  text extractions, rm -rf with PID-scoped /tmp dir. All variables
  properly quoted. No eval, no exec, no dynamic code. Clean.
  
  Reference docs contain offensive security content (reverse shells,
  exploitation tools) — appropriate for sysadmin reference material,
  not executable by the skill.
