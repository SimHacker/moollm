  Local knowledge engine. 5 files audited: SKILL.md, cli-reference.md
  (12KB), examples.md (6KB), mcp-reference.md (1KB), _meta.json.
  ZERO executable code — entirely documentation wrapping the pre-
  installed gno CLI binary. Properly scoped: allowed-tools declares
  Bash(gno:*) Read, preventing arbitrary shell commands. No cloud,
  no API keys, no credentials, no network calls. All risk resides
  in the gno binary itself, which is user-installed and auditable.

  advisories:
    - severity: low
      detail: "gno serve binds 0.0.0.0 by default — exposes search UI on shared networks"
      recommendation: "Users on shared networks should bind to 127.0.0.1"
    - severity: low
      detail: "Read permission grants broad file access (inherent to search tool)"
    - severity: low
      detail: "gno mcp install modifies AI client config files outside project directory"

  best_practices_identified:
    - "allowed-tools frontmatter for declarative permission scoping — all skills should adopt this"
