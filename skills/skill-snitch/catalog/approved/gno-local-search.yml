summary: |
  Local knowledge engine: index directories, search with BM25/vector/
  hybrid, get AI answers with citations. No cloud, no API keys. The
  cleanest skill in the batch. Uses allowed-tools frontmatter for
  declarative permission scoping: Bash(gno:*) Read — restricts shell
  to only gno commands. All skills should adopt this pattern.

notable:
  - "allowed-tools frontmatter for declarative permission scoping"
  - "No cloud, no API keys — entire operation is local"
  - "Well-structured reference docs in separate files"
