summary: |
  Bluetooth thermal printer driver. 2 files audited: SKILL.md (5.6KB),
  _meta.json. ZERO executable code. All commands are explicit user-
  facing CLI invocations (inkjet print, inkjet scan, inkjet config).
  Installation via pip/brew (standard package managers). No network
  exfiltration, no credentials, no hidden behavior. Multi-printer
  orchestration, JSON output, piping support. Even has thoughtful
  children's worksheet tips.

  moollm_integration_potential: |
    Physical output device for adventures (print room descriptions on
    thermal paper), print QR codes for room exits, receipts for economy
    system. Multi-printer orchestration is genuinely useful.
