# GLANCE.yml — constructionism

# 🏗️ "You can't learn to ride a bicycle by reading about it."

what: |
  Seymour Papert's philosophy: learn by building inspectable things.
  The filesystem is a microworld. Skills are constructions.
  Debugging is learning, not failure.

why: |
  - Build to understand (not absorb)
  - Inspect internals to learn mechanics
  - Modify to see consequences
  - Share constructions as public artifacts

when:
  - '"Want to understand deeply" → BUILD'
  - '"Need space for exploration" → CREATE-MICROWORLD'
  - '"Help someone learn" → guide construction'

methods:
  BUILD: "Create something to learn by doing"
  INSPECT: "Examine how something works"
  MODIFY: "Change it, observe consequences"
  SHARE: "Show construction, get feedback"

key_concepts:
  microworld: "Simplified, explorable domain"
  construction: "Something you build to understand"
  public_artifact: "Shareable result of learning"
  debugging: "Natural part of learning, not failure"
  powerful_ideas: "Concepts that unlock new thinking"

moollm_application: |
  Logo microworld → Filesystem
  Turtle graphics → Rooms as space
  Procedures → Skills
  Objects → YAML files (inspectable!)

papert_quote: |
  "The computer is the Proteus of machines.
  Its essence is its universality, its power to simulate."

connection: |
  Play-Learn-Lift IS constructionism as methodology.
  PLAY = build. LEARN = inspect. LIFT = share.
