# Constructionism Skill Prototype
# Learn by building things you can inspect and modify

skill: constructionism
description: "Educational philosophy: construction over consumption"
origin: "Seymour Papert — Logo, Mindstorms, constructionist education"

# Core principles
principles:
  low_floor:
    description: "Easy to start"
    examples:
      - "LOOK command works immediately"
      - "No setup required"
      - "Explore before you configure"
      
  high_ceiling:
    description: "Unlimited complexity"
    examples:
      - "Build custom skills"
      - "Create complex pipelines"
      - "Design new protocols"
      
  wide_walls:
    description: "Many paths to many goals"
    examples:
      - "Adventure games"
      - "Workflow automation"
      - "Knowledge organization"
      - "Character simulation"

# Learning cycle
learning_cycle:
  try: "Attempt something"
  inspect: "See what happened"
  hypothesize: "Form theory about why"
  modify: "Change something"
  retry: "Test the hypothesis"
  understand: "Gain knowledge"

# Inspectability
inspectability:
  requirement: "All state visible in files"
  examples:
    room_state: "ROOM.yml"
    character: "character.yml"
    history: "session-log.md"
    context: "working_set.yml"
  principle: "If you can inspect it, you can trust it"

# Cheating is learning
cheating_as_learning:
  description: "Exploring the implementation rewards you with understanding"
  examples:
    - action: "Open ROOM.yml directly"
      reward: "Learn YAML and room structure"
    - action: "Modify character.yml"
      reward: "Learn character schema"
    - action: "Read session-log.md"
      reward: "Learn event format"

# Microworld mapping
microworld:
  logo:
    turtle: "Character/agent"
    canvas: "Room floor (SVG)"
    procedures: "Skills"
    variables: "YAML state"
    drawing: "File creation"
  moollm:
    filesystem: "The microworld"
    directories: "Rooms"
    files: "Objects"
    skills: "Physics/rules"

# PLAY-LEARN-LIFT integration
play_learn_lift:
  play: "Explore manually, make messes"
  learn: "Notice patterns, understand"
  lift: "Extract principles, create skills"
  cycle: "Repeat at higher levels"
