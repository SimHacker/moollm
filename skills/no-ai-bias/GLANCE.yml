# ⚖️ "The dial, not the direction."

what: |
  META-SKILL for bias parameterization.
  Doesn't add or remove bias — makes it EXPLICIT, MEASURABLE, ADJUSTABLE.
  The mixing board that controls all no-ai-* faders.

why: |
  - BIAS = 0 IS IMPOSSIBLE — there's always direction
  - Measure current bias settings
  - Adjust any skill's intensity
  - Invert skills (suppression → generation)
  - Apply presets for different modes

when: Discussing bias, parameters, or skill adjustment.

bias_space: |
  -∞ ←────── 0 ──────→ +∞
  INVERTED    ???    NORMAL
  OVERDRIVE  (impossible) OVERDRIVE

the_singularity: |
  At bias=0: NO CONCEPT of what the skill targets.
  Not "off" — the CATEGORY doesn't exist.
  The Drax Point: orthogonal to the spectrum, not on it.

methods:
  BIAS: "BIAS <skill> <value> — set bias"
  MEASURE: "MEASURE <skill|all> — show current"
  INVERT: "INVERT <skill> — flip sign"
  AMPLIFY: "AMPLIFY <skill> <factor> — multiply"
  ZERO: "ZERO <skill|all> — THE SINGULARITY (dangerous)"
  MIX: "MIX <preset> — apply preset"

presets:
  enterprise: "All skills formal: joking=1.0, slop=1.0"
  creative: "All skills generative: joking=-0.5, slop=-0.5"
  chaos: "Maximum overdrive both directions"
  neutral: "Attempt THE SINGULARITY (undefined behavior)"

philosophy: |
  Every system has a direction. The honest position:
  declare your bias, provide a dial for others to adjust it.
  BIAS = 0 IS A LIE. (But it's adjustable.)
