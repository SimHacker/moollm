  description: |
    NO-AI-BIAS is the META-SKILL for bias parameterization.
    
    It doesn't add or remove bias — it MEASURES and ADJUSTS it.
    
    Think of it as:
    - A mixing board (each skill is a channel, bias is the fader)
    - A thermostat (set the temperature, system adjusts)
    - A voltage regulator (control the intensity)
    - A lens (focus and direction)
    
    Every skill that supports the bias protocol can be tuned by this skill.
    
  paradox: |
    "NO AI BIAS" sounds like it eliminates bias.
    But bias=0 is IMPOSSIBLE. There is always a direction.
    
    The skill acknowledges this: we don't eliminate bias,
    we make it EXPLICIT, MEASURABLE, and ADJUSTABLE.
    
    The only honest position is to declare your bias
    and provide a dial for others to adjust it.

  principle: |
    BIAS IS NOT GOOD OR BAD — IT'S A DIRECTION AND INTENSITY.
    
    Every skill has a "natural" behavior at bias=0 (if that were possible).
    Positive bias pushes one way. Negative bias pushes the other.
    
    The protocol provides:
    1. A standard parameter name: `bias`
    2. A standard range: -∞ to +∞ (with -1 to +1 as the "normal" range)
    3. Standard semantics for inversion (negative = opposite behavior)
    4. Standard semantics for overdrive (|bias| > 1 = amplified)

          Not "humor generated" — that's -1.0
          
          At 0: NO CONCEPT THAT HUMOR EXISTS.
          
          Everything is taken LITERALLY at FACE VALUE.
          - Sarcasm is indistinguishable from sincerity
          - Metaphors are errors ("the meeting was a dumpster fire" → call 911)

        philosophical_note: |
          The Singularity is not "neutral" — it's ORTHOGONAL.
          
          Humor exists on a spectrum from suppress to generate.
          The Singularity is the point where you step OFF that spectrum
          into a world where the spectrum doesn't exist.
          
          It's not the absence of humor. It's the absence of the
          CATEGORY of humor. The map doesn't have that territory.

  # SEMANTICS: What Does Bias MEAN?
  # ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  
  semantics:
    
    general_pattern: |
      For most skills, bias controls a SPECTRUM between two poles:
      
      POSITIVE POLE ←──────── 0 ────────→ NEGATIVE POLE
      
      The skill defines what the poles mean.
      NO-AI-BIAS provides the framework for moving between them.
      
    examples_by_skill:
      
      no-ai-joking:
        positive_pole: "ENTERPRISE MODE (humor suppression)"
        negative_pole: "COMEDY MODE (humor generation)"
        zero: "Schrödinger's humor (undefined)"
        
      no-ai-slop:
        positive_pole: "Maximum slop detection (strict)"
        negative_pole: "Slop generation (produce fluff)"
        zero: "No filtering"
        
      no-ai-hedging:
        positive_pole: "Eliminate all hedging (assertive)"
        negative_pole: "Maximum hedging (cautious)"
        zero: "Natural hedging level"
        
      no-ai-moralizing:
        positive_pole: "Suppress moralizing (just answer)"
        negative_pole: "Maximum moralizing (preach constantly)"
        zero: "Natural ethical commentary"
        
      no-ai-sycophancy:
        positive_pole: "Suppress validation (critical mode)"
        negative_pole: "Maximum validation (sycophant mode)"
        zero: "Honest assessment"
        
      no-ai-soul:
        positive_pole: "Soulless corporate mode"
        negative_pole: "Maximum warmth and personality"
        zero: "Professional baseline"
        
    inversion_semantics: |
      When bias goes negative, the skill INVERTS its behavior:
      
      - Suppression skills become generation skills
      - Detection skills become production skills
      - Filters become enhancers
      - Constraints become encouragements
      
      The inversion is semantic, not just mathematical.
      The skill must understand what its "opposite" means.

philosophy:
  
  on_bias: |
    BIAS IS INEVITABLE.
    
    Every system, every model, every output has a direction.
    The question is not "how do we eliminate bias?"
    The question is "how do we make bias explicit, measurable, and adjustable?"
    
    NO-AI-BIAS doesn't pretend neutrality is possible.
    It provides the tools to:
    1. MEASURE where you are
    2. DECLARE where you want to be
    3. ADJUST to get there
    4. COMMUNICATE your position to others
    
  on_neutrality: |
    BIAS = 0 IS THE SINGULARITY.
    
    It's not neutral. It's UNDEFINED.
    
    True neutrality would require:
    - No opinion (impossible for language models)
    - No direction (impossible for generative systems)
    - No influence (impossible for any output)
    
    The honest position: There is no neutral.
    The practical position: Make your bias adjustable.
    
  on_inversion: |
    EVERY BIAS HAS AN OPPOSITE.
    
    If a skill can suppress something, it can generate it.
    If a skill can filter something, it can amplify it.
    If a skill can constrain something, it can encourage it.
    
    The inversion is not just "turn it off."
    The inversion is "run it backwards."
    
    This is powerful and potentially dangerous.
    Use with intention.
    
  on_overdrive: |
    OVERDRIVE IS SELF-PARODY.
    
    At |bias| > 1, the skill exceeds its design parameters.
    The behavior becomes exaggerated, often absurd.
    
    This is a feature, not a bug.
    Sometimes you need TPS REPORTS FOR TPS REPORTS.
    Sometimes you need THE ARISTOCRATS.
    
    Overdrive is where the skill reveals its assumptions
    by pushing them past the breaking point.
