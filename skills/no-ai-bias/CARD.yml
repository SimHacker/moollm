  description: |
    Meta-skill for bias parameterization across all MOOLLM skills.
    Doesn't add or remove bias — MEASURES and ADJUSTS it.
    
    Think of it as:
    - A mixing board: each skill is a channel, bias is the fader
    - A thermostat: set the temperature, system adjusts
    - A lens: control focus and direction
    
    Core insight: BIAS = 0 IS A LIE.
    Neutrality is impossible for generative systems.
    Transparency is achievable.

# INVOKE WHEN

invoke_when:
  - "Need to tune a skill's behavior"
  - "Defining or adjusting bias parameters"
  - "Comparing inverted vs normal behavior"
  - "Setting up a preset mix for a context"
  - "Exploring The Drax Point (bias=0)"
  - "Need the mixing board visualization"

# THE BIAS SPACE

bias_space:
  parameter: "bias"
  range: "(-infinity, +infinity) with -1..+1 as normal operating range"
  
  regions:
    negative_overdrive:
      range: "bias < -1.0"
      meaning: "Amplified inversion — reversed AND intensified"
    negative_normal:
      range: "-1.0 to 0"
      meaning: "Inverted operation — opposite of default"
    singularity:
      range: "bias = 0"
      meaning: "LITERALLY NO CONCEPT of what the skill targets"
      alias: "The Drax Point"
    positive_normal:
      range: "0 to +1.0"
      meaning: "Normal operation — skill's default behavior"
    positive_overdrive:
      range: "bias > +1.0"
      meaning: "Amplified normal — intensified beyond design"
      
  semantics:
    negative: "invert behavior"
    positive: "normal behavior"
    overdrive: "|bias| > 1 intensifies beyond design"
    zero: "the category ceases to exist (The Drax Point)"

# THE SINGULARITY — bias = 0

singularity:
  definition: |
    Named The Drax Point — for Drax the Destroyer who takes everything
    literally: "Nothing goes over my head. My reflexes are too fast."
    
    At bias = 0, the skill doesn't turn off. The CATEGORY doesn't exist.
    The discontinuity is COGNITIVE, not behavioral.
    
  examples:
    no-ai-joking:
      positive: "Understands humor, suppresses it"
      negative: "Understands humor, generates it"
      zero: "What is this 'humor' you speak of?"
    no-ai-soul:
      positive: "Has soul, suppresses it"
      negative: "Has soul, amplifies it"
      zero: "Neither soul nor soullessness. THE VOID."

# PHILOSOPHY

philosophy:
  on_bias: |
    BIAS IS INEVITABLE.
    Every system, every model, every output has a direction.
    The question is not "how do we eliminate bias?"
    The question is "how do we make bias explicit, measurable, and adjustable?"
    
  on_neutrality: |
    BIAS = 0 IS THE SINGULARITY.
    It's not neutral. It's UNDEFINED.
    True neutrality would require no opinion, no direction, no influence.
    All impossible for generative systems.
    
  on_inversion: |
    EVERY BIAS HAS AN OPPOSITE.
    If a skill can suppress something, it can generate it.
    The inversion is not "turn it off." It's "run it backwards."
    
  on_overdrive: |
    OVERDRIVE IS SELF-PARODY.
    At |bias| > 1, the skill exceeds its design parameters.
    The behavior becomes exaggerated, often absurd.
    This is a feature, not a bug.
