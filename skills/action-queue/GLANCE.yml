# Full file: CARD.yml (175 lines) | SKILL.md
# 📋 "Queue up what to do next."

what: |
  Sims-style task scheduler.
  Queue actions, execute in order.
  Objects can push prerequisites. Urgent tasks jump line.

why: |
  - Plan action sequences
  - Objects guide multi-step processes
  - Autonomous agent scheduling
  - Interruptible execution

when:
  - "Plan sequence" → DO, DO, DO
  - "Execute next" → NEXT
  - "Urgent interrupt" → URGENT
  - "Check queue" → QUEUE

methods:
  DO: "Add action to end"
  NEXT: "Execute next action"
  QUEUE: "Show current queue"
  URGENT: "Insert at front (jump line)"
  CANCEL: "Remove action"
  CLEAR: "Empty queue"
  REORDER: "Move action"
  PAUSE: "Stop executing"
  RESUME: "Continue executing"

state:
  action_queue: "[eat, shower, sleep]"
  paused: "boolean"
  mode: "[manual, autonomous]"

object_push_pattern: |
  Player: EAT
  Fridge: "Need food first"
  → URGENT: GET-FOOD
  → Then: EAT
  Queue: [GET-FOOD, EAT]

modes:
  manual: "Player says NEXT to advance"
  autonomous: "Agent auto-executes"
