# 🪱 "Every EAT has a POOP. Every CHOMP has a BARF."

what: |
  Two-pointer reversible cursor (head/tail).
  EAT/POOP/BARF/STICK-UP-BUM form a reversible basis.
  Inchworms through directories and links.

why: |
  - Build data pipelines (eat → process → poop)
  - Select ranges (head to tail span)
  - Undo/redo via inverse operations
  - Transform content in-place

when:
  - "Crawl filesystem" → MOVE-WORM, MOVE-HEAD
  - "Pipe between documents" → EAT, POOP
  - "Span a selection" → SELECT-RANGE
  - "Navigate tree" → TREE-UP, TREE-DOWN

reversible_basis:
  EAT: "Ingest at head, parse to brain"
  POOP: "Emit at tail"
  BARF: "Emit at head (inverse of EAT)"
  STICK-UP-BUM: "Inject from tail (inverse of POOP)"
  CHOMP: "Scan pattern, then EAT"

variants:
  bulldozer: "Moves and overwrites"
  link-hopper: "Prefers symlinks"
  mapper: "Maps trees, leaves markers"
  dream: "Ephemeral, speed-of-light"
  tree: "Climbs hierarchies"

tree_navigation: [TREE-UP, TREE-DOWN, TREE-NEXT, TREE-PREV, TREE-OPEN, TREE-CLOSE]

state:
  head: "current head position"
  tail: "current tail position"
  buffer: "ingested content"
  emit_dir: ".moollm/skills/worm/out"
