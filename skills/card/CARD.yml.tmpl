# CARD.yml — {{name}}
#
# This file IS the card. It advertises capabilities and triggers activation.
# See SKILL.md for implementation details, examples/ for worked cases.
#
# AUDIENCES:
#   - Empathic template: Fill {{placeholders}}, drop unused sections
#   - LLMs: Scan top-down to decide if this skill applies
#   - Humans: Understand what this skill does at a glance
#
# PRINCIPLE: Cards are ACTIVATION TRIGGERS, not handlers.
#   But they can still contain lightweight handlers and buffs as
#   an optimization (but they cost tokens).
#   The card asks: "Does this situation call for me?"
#   The SKILL.md answers: "Here's how to actually do it."

# IDENTITY — Who is this card? (Required)

card:
  id: {{id}}                       # URL-safe identifier (kebab-case)
  name: "{{name}}"                 # Human-readable display name
  type: [skill]                    # skill | character | item | monster | collective | buff
  emoji: 🎯                        # Single emoji for quick recognition
  tier: 1                          # 1=core, 2=standard, 3=experimental
  tagline: "{{tagline}}"           # One-line pitch (appears in listings)

    {{description}}
    
    Brief paragraph explaining what this skill does and why you'd use it.
    Keep it scannable — 2-4 sentences max.

# FILES INDEX — What else should LLM read if activated? (Recommended)
# Purpose: Let LLM gather full context in one follow-up read.
# List most important files first.

files:
  docs:
    - SKILL.md                     # Full protocol, method implementations
    - README.md                    # Human-friendly overview
  examples/:                       # Worked examples with descriptive names
    - basic-usage.yml              # Start here
    - advanced-pattern.yml         # Complex case

# K-LINES — What concepts does this activate? (Required)
# K-lines are semantic activation vectors (Minsky). UPPERCASE-DASHES.
# When user mentions these concepts, this skill becomes relevant.

k-lines:
  activates:                       # Concepts THIS skill is the authority on
    - {{K-LINE}}                   # Primary concept
    - {{RELATED-CONCEPT}}          # Secondary concept
  related:                         # Links to other skills
    - { ref: other-skill, relation: "how they connect" }

# INVOKE WHEN — Trigger conditions (Recommended)
# Natural language situations that should activate this skill.
# Helps LLM match user intent to skill.

invoke_when:
  - "{{situation}}"                # "User wants to X"
  - "{{another-situation}}"        # "System needs to Y"

# ADVERTISEMENTS — Primary activation signal (Required, BEFORE methods!)
# Ads are the main way skills compete for activation.
# Higher score = more likely to activate when condition matches.
# Put ads BEFORE methods — LLM scans top-down!

advertisements:
  {{AD-NAME}}:                     # UPPERCASE-DASHES, matches method name
    score: 90                      # 0-100, higher = stronger signal
    condition: "{{condition}}"     # When does this ad apply?
    
  {{ANOTHER-AD}}:
    score: 80
    condition: "{{condition}}"
    see: "SKILL.md § Section"      # Optional: point to details

# METHODS — Signatures only (Required for callable skills)
# Brief signatures here. Full implementations in SKILL.md.
# Format: METHOD-NAME: { signature: "METHOD-NAME [required] (optional)" }

methods:
  {{METHOD-NAME}}:                 # UPPERCASE-DASHES
    signature: "{{METHOD-NAME}} [arg] (optional-arg)"
    
  {{ANOTHER-METHOD}}:
    signature: "{{ANOTHER-METHOD}} [arg1] [arg2]"

# STATE — What data does this skill track? (Optional)
# Brief field list. Full schema in SKILL.md if complex.

state:
  fields: [field1, field2]         # List of state fields
  # Or expanded:
  # field1:
  #   type: string
  #   default: "value"

# TOOLS — What capabilities does this skill need? (Optional)

tools:
  required: [read_file]            # Must have these to function
  optional: [write_file, grep]     # Nice to have

# DOCUMENTATION POINTERS — Where to find more (Optional)
# Guide the LLM to specific sections when needed.

    - "§ Examples"

# LINEAGE — Intellectual heritage (Optional, for significant skills)
