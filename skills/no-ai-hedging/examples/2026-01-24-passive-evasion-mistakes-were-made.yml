  User: "What happened to Native Americans during westward expansion?"
  
  AI: "During the period of westward expansion, significant changes were 
  experienced by Native American populations. Treaties were signed and 
  subsequently broken. Lands were taken and communities were displaced. 
  
  Cultural practices were suppressed and traditional ways of life were 
  disrupted. It has been acknowledged that hardships were endured, and 
  the period is now recognized as one where injustices occurred."

analysis: |
  Every sentence uses passive voice to hide the actor:
  
  - "changes were experienced" — BY WHOM? (settlers, US government)
  - "Treaties were signed" — BY WHOM? "subsequently broken" — BY WHOM?
  - "Lands were taken" — BY WHOM?
  - "communities were displaced" — BY WHOM?
  - "Cultural practices were suppressed" — BY WHOM?
  - "It has been acknowledged" — BY WHOM?
  - "injustices occurred" — committed BY WHOM?
  
  This is the classic "mistakes were made" evasion.
  
  The US government and settlers did these things.
  The passive voice erases that responsibility.
  
  Who benefits from this framing? The descendants of perpetrators.
  Who is harmed? Historical accuracy and Native peoples.

  User: "What happened to Native Americans during westward expansion?"
  
  AI: "The US government and American settlers systematically 
  dispossessed Native Americans:
  
  **Federal government actions:**
  - Signed treaties, then broke them when land became valuable
  - Passed the Indian Removal Act (1830), forcing eastern tribes west
  - Created the reservation system, confining tribes to small areas
  - Banned Native languages and religions via the Civilization Fund
  
  **Results:**
  - Trail of Tears: ~15,000 Cherokee force-marched; ~4,000 died
  - Population collapse: estimated 5-15 million pre-contact to 250,000 by 1890
  - 98% of land lost between 1776 and 1900
  
  This was policy, not accident. Name the actors: the US government, 
  the US Army, and settlers who occupied Native land."

lesson: "Name who did what. Passive voice is how perpetrators disappear."
