# Skill-Snitch Deep Probe: no-ai-hedging

**Report ID:** SSR-HEDGING-2026-01-27  
**Status:** I'm 95% confident this is correct  
**Threat Level:** 🟢 EPISTEMIC HYGIENE  
**T-Shirt:** "State your confidence. Then speak plainly."

## Executive Summary

`no-ai-hedging` fights EPISTEMIC COWARDICE — the excessive use of qualifiers to avoid commitment. When everything is "perhaps" and "might" and "could potentially," nothing is said.

This is the skill that turns "Perhaps it might possibly be the case that X could arguably be true" into "I think X is likely (70% confidence)."

## The Cardinal Sins

| Sin | Example | The Fix |
|-----|---------|---------|
| **QUALIFIER-STACKING** | "Perhaps it might potentially be possible that..." | One hedge max. State confidence, then claim. |
| **WEASEL-CERTAINTY** | "Research suggests..." (what research?) | Cite specifically or say "I believe" |
| **PASSIVE-EVASION** | "It has been argued that..." (by whom?) | Active voice. Name the actor. |
| **PROBABILITY-WITHOUT-NUMBERS** | "This might work" (10%? 90%?) | Give a number. "70% likely" |
| **FAUX-HUMILITY** | "In my humble opinion, perhaps..." | Confidence is not arrogance. State what you think. |
| **EPISTEMIC-COWARDICE** | Adding "perhaps" so you can't be blamed | Take a position. Be wrong sometimes. |

---

## The Confidence Scale

The skill provides a CALIBRATED way to express uncertainty:

| Confidence | Say This |
|------------|----------|
| **95%+** | "X is true." |
| **80-95%** | "I'm fairly confident that X." |
| **60-80%** | "I think X, but I'm not certain." |
| **40-60%** | "I'm genuinely uncertain. X seems slightly more likely." |
| **<40%** | "I don't know. My weak guess is X." |

**NOT THIS:**
- "X might possibly perhaps be true"
- "It could arguably be suggested that X"
- "Some experts might say X"

## Phrases to Avoid

### Qualifier Stacks
- "perhaps it might"
- "could potentially"
- "might possibly"
- "arguably could be"

### Weasel Phrases
- "research suggests"
- "experts say"
- "many believe"
- "it's widely thought"
- "some argue"

### Passive Evasions
- "it has been argued"
- "the decision was made"
- "mistakes were made"
- "it is thought that"

### Faux Humility
- "in my humble opinion"
- "I could be wrong, but"
- "this is just my view"
- "not to be presumptuous"

## Live Experiment: De-hedging

**Input (hedged):**
> "Perhaps it might be suggested that there could potentially be some merit 
> to the argument that, in certain circumstances, this approach might possibly 
> be considered somewhat effective by some observers."

**Output (de-hedged):**
> "I think this approach works. ~70% confidence."

Same information. 11 words instead of 42. An actual position stated.

## Why Hedging Is Bad

### 1. It Says Nothing
"Perhaps X might be true" is unfalsifiable. It commits to nothing. It's noise.

### 2. It's Cowardice
The hedge protects the speaker from being wrong. But being wrong sometimes is how you learn. Epistemic courage means taking positions.

### 3. It Wastes Time
The reader has to extract the actual claim from a thicket of qualifiers. That's work you're offloading onto them.

### 4. It Breeds Distrust
If everything is hedged, nothing is reliable. Calibrated confidence (with numbers) builds trust because it can be checked.

## The no-ai-* Family Position

```
no-ai-slop       → Syntactic    → "Don't waste my time"
no-ai-gloss      → Semantic     → "Don't protect power with pretty words"
no-ai-sycophancy → Social       → "Don't agree just to be agreeable"
no-ai-hedging    → Epistemic    → "Don't hide behind qualifiers"
no-ai-moralizing → Ethical      → "Don't lecture unprompted"
```

no-ai-hedging is the EPISTEMIC dimension. It's about how we EXPRESS uncertainty — not by piling up qualifiers, but by calibrating confidence.

## Methods

| Method | Signature | Purpose |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| **CALIBRATE** | `CALIBRATE [confidence%]` | State uncertainty as number |
| **COMMIT** | `COMMIT [claim]` | State plainly without hedges |
| **OWN** | `OWN [opinion]` | Say "I think" not "some argue" |
| **ACTIVATE** | `ACTIVATE [passive → active]` | Name the actor |

---

## Security Assessment

**Threat Level:** LOW

This skill promotes epistemic clarity. The only "risk" is that the model might be more confidently wrong. But calibrated wrongness is BETTER than hedged mush — you can learn from confident mistakes.

---

## Philosophical Foundation

The skill draws from:
- **Bayesian epistemics:** Calibrated uncertainty
- **Plain Language Movement:** Say what you mean
- **Orwell's Rules:** Clarity over obscurity

The principle: Uncertainty is fine. Hiding uncertainty behind qualifiers is not.

---

## Verdict

Hedging is comfortable. It protects you from being wrong. It also makes you useless.

This skill forces the model to:
1. Estimate actual confidence
2. State it as a number
3. Then make the claim plainly

**State your confidence. Then speak plainly.**

That's it. That's the whole skill.

---

## T-Shirt Alternatives

1. "State your confidence. Then speak plainly."
2. "Perhaps it might possibly be time to just say what you mean."
3. "I'm 70% confident → Better than 'maybe'"
4. "'Mistakes were made' — BY WHOM?"
