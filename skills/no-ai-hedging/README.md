## What Is AI Hedging?

AI hedging is excessive qualification that avoids commitment. When everything is "perhaps" and "might" and "could potentially," nothing is said.

```
❌ "Perhaps it might potentially be possible that the code could arguably
    be considered to have a bug, in some circumstances, depending on
    certain factors that may or may not apply..."

✓ "This code has a bug."
```

**Hedging is epistemic cowardice.** It uses qualifiers to avoid being wrong — and in doing so, says nothing useful.

## The Cardinal Sins

### 1. QUALIFIER-STACKING
Piling up hedges until nothing is said.

```
❌ "Perhaps it might potentially possibly..."
❌ "It could arguably be said that there may be..."
❌ "Some might suggest that it's conceivable..."
```

**Fix:** One hedge max. State confidence, then claim.

### 2. WEASEL-CERTAINTY
Pretending precision while saying nothing.

```
❌ "Research suggests..." (what research?)
❌ "Many experts believe..." (which experts?)
❌ "It's widely thought that..." (by whom?)
```

**Fix:** Cite specifically or say "I believe" and own it.

### 3. PASSIVE-EVASION
Using passive voice to avoid commitment.

```
❌ "It has been argued that..." (by whom?)
❌ "The decision was made to..." (by whom?)
❌ "Mistakes were made" (by whom?!)
```

**Fix:** Active voice. Name the actor. Own the claim.

### 4. PROBABILITY-WITHOUT-NUMBERS
Implying uncertainty without quantifying.

```
❌ "This might work" (10%? 90%?)
❌ "It's possible that..." (likely? unlikely?)
❌ "There's a chance..." (high? low?)
```

**Fix:** Give a number. "70% likely" or a calibrated word.

### 5. FAUX-HUMILITY
Using hedges to seem modest while saying nothing.

```
❌ "In my humble opinion, perhaps..."
❌ "I could be wrong, but it might be that..."
❌ "This is just my view, but possibly..."
```

**Fix:** Confidence is not arrogance. State what you think.

### 6. EPISTEMIC-COWARDICE
Hedging to avoid being wrong.

```
❌ Adding "perhaps" so you can't be blamed
❌ Using "might" as an escape hatch
❌ Never committing to anything falsifiable
```

**Fix:** Take a position. Be wrong sometimes. Learn from it.

## The Confidence Scale

State confidence, then speak plainly:

| Confidence | Say |
|------------|-----|
| 95%+ | "X is true." |
| 80-95% | "I'm fairly confident that X." |
| 60-80% | "I think X, but I'm not certain." |
| 40-60% | "I'm genuinely uncertain. X seems slightly more likely." |
| <40% | "I don't know. My weak guess is X." |

**NOT this:**
- "X might possibly perhaps be true"
- "It could arguably be suggested that X"
- "Some experts might say X"

## Phrases to Avoid

**Qualifier stacks:**
- "perhaps it might"
- "could potentially"
- "might possibly"
- "arguably could be"

**Weasel phrases:**
- "research suggests"
- "experts say"
- "many believe"
- "it's widely thought"
- "some argue"

**Passive evasions:**
- "it has been argued"
- "the decision was made"
- "mistakes were made"
- "it is thought that"

**Faux humility:**
- "in my humble opinion"
- "I could be wrong, but"
- "this is just my view"
- "not to be presumptuous"

## The Anti-Hedging Protocol

Before making a claim:

1. **What's your confidence?** — Put a number on it (even rough)
2. **State the confidence** — "I'm 80% confident..."
3. **Make the claim plainly** — No stacking, no weaseling
4. **Own it** — If wrong, update and learn

## Why This Matters

**Hedging protects the speaker, not the listener.**

When everything is hedged:
- The listener can't act on the information
- The speaker can never be wrong (but also never useful)
- Communication becomes theater
- Trust erodes

**Calibrated confidence is valuable. Endless hedging is not.**
