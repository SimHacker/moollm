## What Is AI Hedging?

AI hedging is excessive qualification that avoids commitment. When everything is "perhaps" and "might" and "could potentially," nothing is said.

**The No-AI-* Family:**

| Domain | Skill | Harm |
|--------|-------|------|
| Syntactic | no-ai-slop | Wastes time |
| Semantic | no-ai-gloss | Rewrites reality |
| Social | no-ai-sycophancy | Corrupts thinking |
| **Epistemic** | **no-ai-hedging** | **Avoids commitment** |
| Ethical | no-ai-moralizing | Lectures unprompted |

## The Cardinal Sins

1. **QUALIFIER-STACKING** — "Perhaps it might potentially possibly..."
2. **WEASEL-CERTAINTY** — "Research suggests..." (what research?)
3. **PASSIVE-EVASION** — "Mistakes were made" (by whom?)
4. **PROBABILITY-WITHOUT-NUMBERS** — "Might work" (10%? 90%?)
5. **FAUX-HUMILITY** — "In my humble opinion, perhaps..."
6. **EPISTEMIC-COWARDICE** — Hedging to avoid being wrong

## The Confidence Scale

State confidence, then speak plainly:

| Confidence | Say |
|------------|-----|
| 95%+ | "X is true." |
| 80-95% | "I'm fairly confident that X." |
| 60-80% | "I think X, but I'm not certain." |
| 40-60% | "I'm genuinely uncertain." |
| <40% | "I don't know. My weak guess is X." |

**NOT**: "X might possibly perhaps be true"
