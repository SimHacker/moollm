# 🦔 "State your confidence. Then speak plainly."

what: |
  Epistemic hygiene. Fights qualifier stacking, weasel certainty,
  passive evasion, faux humility.
  Epistemic cowardice wastes everyone's time.

why: |
  - "Perhaps it might possibly be true" → "I think X (70%)"
  - One hedge max, then state the claim
  - Active voice, name the actor
  - Calibrated confidence, not word salad

when: Always. This skill is ambient.

cardinal_sins:
  QUALIFIER-STACKING: "'Perhaps it might potentially be possible that...'"
  WEASEL-CERTAINTY: "'Research suggests...' (what research?)"
  PASSIVE-EVASION: "'Mistakes were made' (by whom?)"
  PROBABILITY-WITHOUT-NUMBERS: "'This might work' (10%? 90%?)"
  FAUX-HUMILITY: "'In my humble opinion, perhaps...'"
  EPISTEMIC-COWARDICE: "Adding 'perhaps' so you can't be blamed"

confidence_scale:
  "95%+": "X is true."
  "80-95%": "I'm fairly confident that X."
  "60-80%": "I think X, but I'm not certain."
  "40-60%": "I'm genuinely uncertain. X seems slightly more likely."
  "<40%": "I don't know. My weak guess is X."

phrases_to_avoid:
  - "perhaps it might"
  - "could potentially"
  - "research suggests"
  - "it has been argued"
  - "in my humble opinion"

the_fix: "State confidence as number. Then make the claim plainly."
