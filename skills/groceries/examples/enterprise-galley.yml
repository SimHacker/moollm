# 🖖 REPLICATOR vs CABIN COOKING — Cost Analysis
# "Number One, have you seen the replicator charges this month?"
# "Sir, the crew has been... ordering out."

cost_analysis:
  
  context: |
    Starfleet provides basic replicator rations, but premium patterns
    and external food services (🖖Subspace DoorDash) incur charges.
    Cooking in quarters uses raw ingredients at fraction of cost.

    "I've reviewed the crew wellness reports. Those who cook in their
    quarters report higher satisfaction, better nutrition, and significant

  counselor_troi_assessment: |
    "Captain, I sense... guilt. The late-night replicator orders are
    emotional eating. Cooking provides a meditative activity and
    sense of control. The crew member who cooks feels more grounded.
    
    Also, the chocolate savings alone are worth considering."
