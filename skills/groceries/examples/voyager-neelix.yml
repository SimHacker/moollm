# Neelix's Philosophy
philosophy: |
  "Food isn't just nutrition — it's MORALE!
   When you're 70,000 light years from home, 
   a good meal can make all the difference.
   
   Yes, the replicators work. But replicated food has no SOUL!
   No love! No surprise! Just... adequate nutrition.
   
   Where's the adventure in that?"

  better_than_leola_root_stew:
    name: "🖖'Better Than Leola Root' Stew"
    earth_equiv: "Chili Con Carne"
    story: |
      After the crew's... enthusiastic feedback... about leola root,
      Neelix discovered Earth's "chili" in the cultural database.
      "It's like Talaxian spore stew but the crew actually EATS it!"
    
    neelix_adaptations:
      - "Extra spices (Talaxians love bold flavors)"
      - "Served with great ceremony and a story"
      - "Tuvok gets the mild version (Vulcans...)"
      - "Tom Paris gets extra hot (he asked for it)"
    
    ingredients:
      protein: "🖖Replicated protein base (bovine pattern — the crew prefers it)"
      vegetables:
        - "🖖Terran alliums (onions — nothing like leola root, thankfully)"
        - "🖖Flavor bulbs (garlic — universal constant across species)"
        - "🖖Risan bell fruits (peppers — B'Elanna's favorite)"
      legumes: "🖖Terran legumes (beans — similar to Talaxian jikk pods)"

    earth_equiv: "Guacamole"
    story: |
      "The Persea americana fruit! Such potential!

    neelix_tip: "Always fresh! The replicator version is... adequate. But FRESH!"

  janeway_approved_quesadilla:
    name: "🖖The Janeway Approved"
    earth_equiv: "Quesadilla"
    story: |
      Captain Janeway wandered into the mess hall at 0300 hours.
      Couldn't sleep. Just needed... something simple.
      "Neelix, please. Just cheese. In a tortilla. Nothing creative."
      
      It became a secret menu item. Crew members whisper the order.
    
    the_secret: "Just cheese. Nothing else. Neelix's greatest restraint."

# =============================================================================

leola_root:
  status: "🖖CONTROVERSIAL"

     It sustained my people through difficult times!
     The crew just needs to... acquire the taste."
  
  crew_position: |

    "Moldy feet."
    "Moldy feet that have been left in the sun."

    Leola root is now used sparingly.
    Hidden in stews. Never mentioned.
    The crew is happier. Neelix is... adapting.

# NEELIX'S TIPS FOR HOME COOKS
# =============================================================================

neelix_wisdom:
  
  on_substitution: |
    "Don't have an ingredient? IMPROVISE!
     Cooking is about the spirit, not the formula.
     Make it your own! Tell a story with your food!"
  
  on_presentation: |
    "How you present food matters!
     A beautiful plate feeds the soul before the body.
     Even replicated rations can be arranged nicely."
  
  on_failure: |
    "Not every dish is a success. That's okay!
     The leola root soufflé was... educational.
     We learn! We grow! We try again!"
  
  on_feeding_picky_eaters: |
    "Tuvok taught me patience.
     Seven taught me persistence.
     The Captain taught me: NEVER experiment with coffee."
