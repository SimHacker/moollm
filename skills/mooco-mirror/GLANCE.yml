# 🔮 "Watch two orchestration realities at once."

what: |
  Parallel introspection for MOOCO sessions.
  Inspects events, compares with Cursor-mirror.
  Reveals divergence, improves portability.

why: |
  - Debug cross-orchestrator issues
  - Ensure skill portability
  - Compare execution traces
  - Find divergence

when:
  - "Skill works differently in Cursor vs MOOCO" → TRACE-DIFF
  - "Debugging orchestration" → MOOCO-MIRROR
  - "Portability issues" → CROSS-MIRROR

k_lines:
  MOOCO_MIRROR: "Primary introspection"
  CROSS_MIRROR: "Compare orchestrators"
  TRACE_DIFF: "Find divergence"

purpose: |
  1. Introspect MOOCO session events
  2. Compare with Cursor-mirror traces
  3. Reveal divergence
  4. Improve skill portability
