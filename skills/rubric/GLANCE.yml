# 📐 "How do we know it's good?"

what: |
  Measurable criteria for scoring outputs.
  Translates qualitative discussion to quantitative decision.
  Essential for adversarial committee workflow.

why: |
  - Define explicit success criteria
  - Score options objectively
  - Compare alternatives
  - Pass/fail thresholds

when:
  - "Need success criteria" → CREATE
  - "Compare options" → SCORE
  - "Understand criteria" → EXPLAIN

methods:
  CREATE: "Design a rubric"
  SCORE: "Apply rubric to output"
  EXPLAIN: "Show rubric criteria"

schema:
  name: "Rubric name"
  criteria: "List of {name, weight, levels}"
  weights: "How much each criterion matters"
  threshold: "Pass/fail line"

committee_integration: |
  DELIBERATE → Output → SCORE
  Score < threshold? → CRITIQUE → Re-DELIBERATE
  Score >= threshold? → APPROVE

  Code Quality Rubric:
  - Readability (0.3)
  - Performance (0.25)
  - Maintainability (0.25)
  - Test Coverage (0.2)
  Threshold: 70
