2. **Navigation** — can guide to any part of system

## Why This Skill Exists

Every system needs:
1. A way to explain itself
2. A way to navigate
3. A way to articulate its philosophy

The moollm skill IS that mechanism.

When you're lost: **invoke moollm**.
When you don't know what to do: **ask moollm**.
When you want to understand: **query moollm**.

## Verdict

**THE HEART OF THE SYSTEM. APPROVE.**

This is the skill that makes MOOLLM self-describing. Without it, MOOLLM would be a collection of files. With it, MOOLLM can explain itself.

The soul of a system is its ability to articulate what it is.
