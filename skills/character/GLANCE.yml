# GLANCE.yml — character
# Full file: CARD.yml (168 lines) | SKILL.md
# 🧑 "Characters are BODIES. Personas are COSTUMES."

what: |
  Foundational entity pattern. Characters have location, inventory,
  relationships. Players, NPCs, companions, bots — all are characters.
  Personas are identity layers worn on top.

why: |
  - Every entity that moves and acts is a character
  - Multiple dispatch for inter-character interactions
  - Clear body/role separation
  - State ownership (CHARACTER.yml is canonical)

when:
  - '"Create entity that moves" → CREATE'
  - '"Pick up items" → TAKE, DROP'
  - '"Change role" → WEAR, REMOVE-PERSONA'
  - '"Characters interact" → SNIFF, GREET, CUDDLE'

character_types:
  player: "Human via chat"
  npc: "DM controlled, responds when addressed"
  companion: "Follows player, has personality"
  bot: "Action queue, autonomous"
  agent: "LLM with own goals"

state_fields:
  - id, name
  - home (never moves)
  - location (changes during play)
  - inventory, gold
  - current-persona
  - sims_traits, mind_mirror
  - buffs, relationships

multiple_dispatch: |
  dog SNIFFS cat → dog_sniffs_cat (most specific)
  Resolution: 'CHARACTER.yml → species skill → target skill → base'

inventory_types:
  object: "Deep copy with weight"
  ref: "Pointer, weight: 0"
  fungible: "Stack with count"

character_vs_persona: |
  CHARACTER = BODY (the actor)
  PERSONA = COSTUME (the role)
  Same body can wear different costumes.
