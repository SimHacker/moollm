  tagline: "Characters are BODIES. Personas are COSTUMES."
  
  description: |
    The foundational pattern for any entity that has a location,
    inventory, and relationships. Players, NPCs, creatures, bots —
    all are characters.
    
    Characters are BODIES (actors). Personas are COSTUMES (roles).

# CHARACTER LAYER OVERLAYS — Private extensions to public characters


character_layers:
  
  concept: |
    Characters can exist as OVERLAY TREES across multiple repositories.
    A public character can be extended by private layers that add
    sensitive content while inheriting all public traits.
    
  visibility:
    rule: "One-way inheritance: private sees public, public cannot see private"
    public_layer: "Shareable, forkable, no references to private layers"
    private_layer: "Extends via inherits:, adds personal/sensitive content"
    
  declaration:
    principle: "Both layers declare their relationship in CHARACTER.yml"
    
    public_declares: |
      # In public CHARACTER.yml header:
      # EXTENSIBILITY NOTE:
      # This character can be extended with private layers via inheritance.
      # Private layers can add personal details while inheriting public traits.
      
    private_declares: |
      # In private CHARACTER.yml:
      inherits:
        - moollm://path/to/public/character/
      extends:
        public_character: "moollm://path/to/public/character/"
        relationship: "private extends public"
        
  precedence:
    principle: "Negotiate precedence per-field in metadata"
    
    fields: |
      Each field can declare its precedence:
      - public_wins: public layer is canonical (e.g., name, id)
      - private_wins: private layer overrides (e.g., real_address)
      - merge: combine both (e.g., inventory, relationships)
      - private_only: only exists in private (e.g., sensitive_history)
      
    example: |
      private:
        precedence:
          name: public_wins       # Keep public name
          location: private_wins  # Real location is private
          inventory: merge        # Combine both inventories
          home_address: private_only  # Only in private layer
          
  resolution:
    success: "Layers merge according to declared precedence"
    conflict: |
      If declarations conflict or are missing:
      - MOOLLM warns about unresolved precedence
      - Conservative default: public_wins for shared fields
      - Private-only fields always accepted
      
    validation: |
      On load, verify:
      1. Public layer exists at declared inherits: path
      2. Private precedence declarations are complete
      3. No circular inheritance
      4. Public layer doesn't reference private (blocked)
      
  use_cases:
    - "Real people with public persona + private details"
    - "NPCs with public stats + GM-only secrets"
    - "Shared characters with user-specific customizations"
    - "Test characters with production + dev variants"


# PERSONAS — Society of Mind Internal Actors

#
# "We need many interacting personas inside our head!" — Minsky
#
# Personas are NOT just costumes. They are INTERNAL ACTORS that:
# - Plug in and PLAY OFF each other
# - Execute protocols and SOUL CHATS between each other
# - Form a Society of Mind inside one character
#
# See: skills/persona/ for full protocol

personas_society:
  
  minsky_insight: |
    Marvin Minsky's "Society of Mind" says intelligence emerges from
    many simple agents interacting. A character's mind works the same way:
    multiple personas inside, each with their own voice, skills, goals,
    playing off each other, negotiating, sometimes conflicting.
    
    This ISN'T multiple personality disorder — it's how minds WORK.
    The programmer persona, the parent persona, the artist persona,
    the critic persona — all active, all interacting.
    
  what_personas_are:
    not_just_costumes: "Personas are internal ACTORS, not masks"
    internal_agents: "Each persona has voice, skills, methods, goals"
    interactive: "Personas TALK TO EACH OTHER inside the character"
    modulated: "Each persona individually tuned and transformed"
    composable: "Personas plug in, combine, play off each other"
    
  character_contains:
    principle: "A character contains a SET of active personas"
    
    structure: |
      personas:
        active:
          - id: programmer
            source: personas/programmer
            modulation: { intensity: 0.8, voice_weight: 0.6 }
          - id: rabbit
            source: personas/rabbit-form
            modulation: { intensity: 0.4, instinct_weight: 0.3 }
          - id: mentor
            source: personas/wise-elder
            modulation: { intensity: 0.5, patience: 0.9 }
            
  persona_interactions:
    soul_chats: |
      Personas can have INTERNAL DIALOGUES:
      
      [programmer]: "We should refactor this properly."
      [rabbit]: "But the carrots are RIGHT THERE."
      [mentor]: "Perhaps we can do both — refactor, then snack."
      
    protocol_execution: |
      Personas execute protocols between each other:
      - NEGOTIATE: personas debate a decision
      - DEFER: one persona yields to another
      - AMPLIFY: personas reinforce each other
      - CONFLICT: personas disagree (creates tension/drama)
      
    emergence: |
      The character's behavior EMERGES from persona interactions.
      No single persona is "in charge" — they form a society.
      
  vs_character_overlay:
    overlay: |
      HEAVY: Full character layered on top
      IDENTITY-LEVEL: Extends who you ARE
      RISKY: Can cause "issues" (identity conflicts, confusion)
      USE CASE: Private shadow of public character
      
    persona: |
      LIGHT: Plug-in actors inside the character
      ROLE-LEVEL: What you DO, how you THINK
      SAFE: Designed to coexist and interact
      USE CASE: Internal society of mind
      
    warning: |
      Full character overlay might cause "issues" —
      identity conflicts, precedence problems, existential confusion.
      
      Personas are DESIGNED to coexist. They PLAY OFF each other.
      That's the point.
      
  methods:
    SUMMON_PERSONA: "Activate a persona in the internal society"
    DISMISS_PERSONA: "Deactivate a persona (still available, not active)"
    PERSONA_CHAT: "Internal dialogue between active personas"
    MODULATE: "Adjust a persona's intensity/weight"
    NEGOTIATE: "Personas debate internally about a decision"

# HOME VS LOCATION (brief — see SKILL.md)

location_protocol:
  home: "Directory where CHARACTER.yml lives (never moves)"
  location: "Where character currently IS (changes during play)"
  rule: "Update location field, don't move files"

# CHARACTERS.yml RUNTIME CACHE — Where is everyone?

runtime_cache:
  file: "CHARACTERS.yml"
  location: "Adventure root (e.g., examples/adventure-4/CHARACTERS.yml)"
  template: "skills/adventure/templates/CHARACTERS.yml.tmpl"
  purpose: |
    Quick reference for all character locations without reading 52 files.
    NOT source of truth for souls — just spatial awareness cache.
    
  what_it_tracks:
    - home (character directory)
    - location (current position)
    - party (who they're with)
    - doing (current activity)
    - mood (current state)
    - goals (what they want)
    
  sync_protocol: |
    When you update a character's location:
    1. Update CHARACTERS.yml (the cache)
    2. Update CHARACTER.yml in their home dir (the truth)
    
  turning_off: |
    Move characters from 'active' to 'inactive' to turn them off.
    They won't be tracked, won't respond, won't cost attention.
    
  derived_index: |
    by_location section shows who's where — regenerated from active list.

# INVENTORY PROTOCOL — see skills/inventory/ for full protocol
