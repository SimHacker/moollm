# 🧠 "Intelligence emerges from many simple agents."

what: |
  Minsky's theory implemented in MOOLLM.
  Skills are agents. Characters are societies.
  No single agent understands — understanding emerges from pattern.

why: |
  - Characters with inner conflict
  - Emergent behavior, not scripted
  - Multi-agent deliberation
  - Self-observation (B-brain)

when:
  - '"Inner character conflict" → define competing agents'
  - '"Emergent behavior" → assemble_agency'
  - '"Self-awareness" → observe_society (B-brain)'

key_concepts:
  agent: "Simple process with single function"
  agency: "Cluster of agents producing behavior"
  k_line: "Activation vector connecting to agents"
  censor: "Agent preventing bad outputs"
  suppressor: "Agent inhibiting others"
  b_brain: "Self-observation agent"

agent_interface:
  id: "Unique identifier"
  function: "What it does (single thing)"
  activates_when: "Conditions"
  suppresses: "Agents it inhibits"
  amplifies: "Agents it strengthens"
  knows: "Usually minimal"

competition: |
  Agents compete. Winner activates. Loser suppresses.
  Example: creative(80) + social(70) > fear(60) + perfectionist(50)
  Action: Palm shares the essay.

methods:
  define_agent: "Create minimal agent"
  assemble_agency: "Combine into emergent behavior"
  resolve_competition: "Determine winner"
  activate_k_line: "Fire agent constellation"
  observe_society: "Enable B-brain self-awareness"

sims_connection: |
  score = sum(motive × effect)
  Needs are agents. Behavior emerges from competition.

llm_pattern: |
  SITUATION: [context]
  AGENT_1: [speaks]
  AGENT_2: [speaks]
  Show debate. Character decides.
