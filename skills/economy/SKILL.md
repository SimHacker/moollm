### Parallel Currencies (Non-Convertible)

These exist *beside* MOOLAH — they cannot be bought or sold for coins.

| Symbol | Name | Type | How to Get |
|--------|------|------|------------|
| ⭐ | KARMA | Reputation | Good deeds, keeping promises |
| 🎫 | FAVOR | Social debt | "You owe me one" |
| 🔮 | ESSENCE | Magical | Found, not bought |
| ⏳ | TIME | Temporal | Exists, must be spent |

#### ⭐ KARMA — Social Credit

Earned through ethical behavior, lost through betrayal.
- **Affects:** NPC attitudes, quest access, prices
- **Cannot be bought** — only earned
- **Visible to some:** Certain NPCs can "see" your karma

#### 🎫 FAVOR — Social IOUs

"I did something for you. Someday, I'll ask for something in return."
- **Specific to relationships** — Palm owes Don a favor
- **Can be traded** — "I'll give you my favor from Klaus"
- **Expires?** — Depends on the relationship

#### 🔮 ESSENCE — Magical Currency

Rare, precious, cannot be manufactured or purchased.
- **Sources:** Ancient artifacts, magical creatures, liminal moments
- **Uses:** Enchantments, wishes, transformations
- **Palm's golden earring** might contain some

#### ⏳ TIME — The Unbuyable

Some things cost time, not money.
- **Training:** Takes time to learn
- **Crafting:** Takes time to make
- **Healing:** Takes time to recover
- **"Time is money"** — but not exchangeable

### Quick Reference

```
FUNGIBLE (can convert):
  1000 🥜 = 1 🪙 = 0.001 💎 = 0.000001 👑
  
  Symmetrical: each step is ×1000

NON-FUNGIBLE (cannot convert):
  ⭐ KARMA    — reputation
  🎫 FAVOR   — social debt  
  🔮 ESSENCE — magical
  ⏳ TIME    — temporal
```

**Etymology:**
- Sounds like "moolah" (slang for money)
- Sounds like "MOO" (the language MOOLLM descends from)
- Circular: MOOLLM → MOOLAH → MOOLLM
