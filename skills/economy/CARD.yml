# DESIGN NOTES

design_notes:
  moolah_hierarchy: |
    🥜 NUT — "working for peanuts", small but real (1/1000 🪙)
    🪙 MOOLAH — the satisfying clink of a coin (×1000 up and down)
    💎 GRAND — valuable, visible, impressive (1000 🪙)
    👑 FORTUNE — kingdom-level wealth (1000 💎)
    
    Symmetrical: NUT ←×1000→ MOOLAH ←×1000→ GRAND ←×1000→ FORTUNE
  parallel: |
    ⭐ KARMA — earned, not bought
    🎫 FAVOR — social, specific, tradeable
    🔮 ESSENCE — magical, rare, precious
    ⏳ TIME — the one thing money can't buy
  inclusivity: |
    The economy skill embraces ALL currencies.
    MOOLAH is native to MOOLLM, but gold, dollars, 
    simoleons, and custom currencies are all valid.
    Context determines which currency applies.
