# Skill Snitch Report: economy

**Date:** 2026-01-28  
**Auditor:** Deep Probe  
**Verdict:** MONEY IS JUST A NUMBER UNTIL SOMEONE WANTS IT

---

## Executive Summary

**Currency, trade, and economic flow.**

Multiple currencies supported: 🐄MOOLAH (native), gold, dollars, custom.

Parallel currencies exist beside money: karma, favor, essence, time.

---

## The Native Coin: 🐄MOOLAH

```
👑 FORTUNE = 1,000 💎 = 1,000,000 🪙 = 1,000,000,000 🥜
💎 GRAND   = 1,000 🪙 = 1,000,000 🥜
🪙 MOOLAH  = 1,000 🥜
🥜 NUT     = 0.001 🪙
```

Symmetrical: each step is ×1000.

Etymology: Sounds like "moolah" (slang for money) and "MOO" (LambdaMOO).

> "The economy skill embraces ALL currencies."

🐄MOOLAH is native to MOOLLM, but gold, dollars, simoleons, and custom currencies are all valid. Context determines which applies.

## Security Assessment

### Concerns

1. **Inflation** — too much currency created
2. **Duplication** — items/money copied
3. **Karma manipulation** — gaming reputation

### Mitigations

- Transactions logged
- State visible in files
- Parallel currencies non-convertible

**Risk Level:** LOW — standard game economics

## Verdict

**MULTI-CURRENCY SUPPORT. APPROVE.**

🐄MOOLAH is native. Everything else is welcome.

Karma can't be bought.
