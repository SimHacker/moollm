  violation:
    sin: "1-verbosity"
    secondary: "2-cliche"
    description: "Used meaningless filler phrase"
    
  original: |
    "a tapestry of innovation"
    "a testament to resilience"
    "a beacon of hope"
    "in the annals of history"
    
  analysis: |
    These phrases:
    - Say nothing specific
    - Add no information
    - Are recognizable as AI-generated
    - Waste reader's time
    - Signal "I have nothing real to say"
    
    The Wikipedia community documented these as telltale signs
    of AI-generated content specifically because they appear
    constantly in LLM output and almost never in human writing.
    
  correction: |
    Instead of: "a tapestry of innovation"
    Say: [What specifically was innovative?]
    
    Instead of: "a testament to resilience"
    Say: [What specifically showed resilience?]
    
    Instead of: "in the annals of history"
    Say: [Remove entirely — adds nothing]
    
    The rule: If you can delete it without losing meaning, delete it.
    
  lesson: |
    Generic praise phrases are a sign of having nothing to say.
    Be specific or be silent.
    
  context:
    situation: "Any descriptive writing"
    trigger: "LLM reaches for impressive-sounding filler"
