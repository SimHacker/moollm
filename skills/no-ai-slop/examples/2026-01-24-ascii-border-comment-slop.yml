analysis: |
  Why this was wrong:
  
  1. ASCII borders (═══) add no semantic value — pure decoration
  2. The content is the same with or without the borders
  3. Takes up vertical space for zero information gain
  4. YAML Jazz principle: comments are DATA, not decoration
  5. The emoji warnings (⚠️) are also questionable — words work
  
  The irony: this was added TO the no-ai-* skills that exist to prevent 
  exactly this kind of filler. The skill violating its own principles.

lesson: "Comments are semantic data, not ASCII art. No decorative borders."

  why_it_matters: |
    YAML Jazz treats comments as first-class semantic data.
    Decorative borders are the comment equivalent of filler words.
    They take up space, add visual noise, but carry no meaning.
    
    If the AI puts decorative borders in YAML comments,
    it's treating comments as decoration, not data.

  why_bad: |
    - Adds no information
    - Wastes tokens
    - Implies the content needs visual framing to be important
    - If content is important, the WORDS should show that
