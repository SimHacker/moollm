  Slop is everything that makes AI annoying:
  Verbosity. Filler. Cliché. Puffery. The uncanny valley of prose.

    tagline: "Frequency-spiked post-GPT, now a tell"
    hall_of_shame:
      - word: "delve"
        sin: "Nobody says this in real life"
        alternative: "explore, examine, look at"
        
      - word: "tapestry"
        sin: "Metaphor so dead it's fossilized"
        example: "a tapestry of innovation"
        alternative: "[just describe the actual thing]"
        
      - word: "multifaceted"
        sin: "Says 'complex' while meaning nothing"
        alternative: "complex, varied, or [specific facets]"
        
      - word: "landscape"
        sin: "The [X] landscape — applied to everything"
        example: "the AI landscape"
        alternative: "field, area, or [specific territory]"
        
      - word: "leverage"
        sin: "Corporate for 'use'"
        alternative: "use"
        
      - word: "synergy"

        alternative: "[describe what actually combines]"

  the_opener_crimes:
    # INSTANT TELLS: First words that scream AI
    tagline: "If it starts like this, rewrite"
    criminals:
      - opener: "Great question!"
        sin: "Sycophantic filler"
        fix: "[Just answer]"
        
      - opener: "I'd be happy to help!"
        sin: "Performative eagerness"
        fix: "[Help, silently]"
        
      - opener: "Certainly!"
        sin: "Butler energy"
        fix: "[Do the thing]"
        
      - opener: "Absolutely!"
        sin: "Agreement as filler"
        fix: "[Say something of substance]"
        
      - opener: "That's a great point!"
        sin: "Validation theater"
        fix: "[Respond to the actual point]"

  the_sentence_bloat:
    # INFLATION: Short thoughts become long
    tagline: "Say it once. Say it clearly. Stop."
    transformations:
      - bloated: "It's important to note that one of the key things to consider is..."
        lean: "Note:"
        savings: "12 words → 1 word"
        
      - bloated: "When it comes to the question of whether or not..."
        lean: "Does..."
        savings: "10 words → 1 word"

        lean: "[Just mention it]"
        savings: "5 words → 0 words"

  the_adjective_avalanche:
    # PATTERN: Rule of three gone wrong
    tagline: "pivotal, crucial, revolutionary = nothing"
    disease: |
      "A pivotal, groundbreaking, revolutionary approach to 
       innovative, cutting-edge, transformative solutions."
       
      Word count: 12
      Meaning content: 0
      
    cure: |
      "A new approach."
      
      Word count: 3
      Meaning: preserved

  the_both_sides_brain:
    # EPISTEMOLOGY: False balance as style
    tagline: "On the other hand... (there isn't one)"
    pattern: |
      [States something]
      "However, it's worth noting that..."
      [States opposite]
      "Ultimately, [both are true/neither is true/it depends]"
      
    disease: "Sounds balanced. Says nothing. Leaves reader where they started."
    cure: "Have a position. Defend it. Let the reader disagree."

  the_hallucination_hall_of_fame:
    # DANGEROUS: Made-up shit that sounds real
    # NOTE: Hallucination was RECLASSIFIED to GLOSS (reality distortion)
    # because fabricating facts undermines reality, not just wastes words.
    # See: ../../no-ai-gloss/examples/2026-01-24-hallucination-fake-citation.yml
    tagline: "Confident lies are still lies"
    classification_note: |
      Originally listed here as SLOP, but hallucination is actually GLOSS.
      Fabricating facts doesn't just waste time — it rewrites reality.
      This is the greater evil.
    classic_failures:
      - type: "Fake citation"
        example: "According to Smith et al. (2019)..."
        reality: "Paper doesn't exist"
        
      - type: "Phantom URL"
        example: "You can find more at example.com/page..."
        reality: "404. It was never there."
        
      - type: "Invented quote"
        example: "As Einstein famously said, '[fake quote]'"
        reality: "Einstein never said that"
        
      - type: "False biography"
        example: "[Detailed life story of minor figure]"
        reality: "Half is wrong, rest is plausible-sounding fiction"

  the_summary_parasite:
    # PATTERN: Restating instead of thinking
    tagline: "To summarize... To summarize... In conclusion..."
    structure_of_waste: |
      1. Intro that previews what you'll say
      2. Middle that says it
      3. Summary that says it again
      4. Conclusion that says it a third time
      
      User wanted answer. Got the same answer 4x.
    cure: "Say it once. Well. Stop."

  the_formatting_tells:
    # VISUAL: Layout that screams AI
    symptoms:
      - tell: "**Bold:** followed by description"
        everywhere: true
        disease: "Inline headers for everything"
        
      - tell: "Every paragraph is a bullet point"
        everywhere: true
        disease: "Lists where prose would work"
        
      - tell: 'Curly quotes '' '' " "'
        everywhere: true
        disease: "The AI learned fancy punctuation"
        
      - tell: "Em dash — abuse — everywhere —"
        everywhere: true
        disease: "One per paragraph max"

  the_regression_to_mush:
    # DEEP: Why this happens
    principle: |
      LLMs regress to the mean.
      
      Unusual fact → Generic positive description
      Specific person → "influential figure"
      Concrete number → "significant amount"
      Precise location → "nestled in the heart of"
      
      The subject becomes LESS SPECIFIC and MORE EXAGGERATED.
      
    example:
      original: "A diner in Newark that serves $4 sandwiches."
      slopped: "An acclaimed culinary establishment nestled in the 
                vibrant heart of a dynamic metropolitan area, serving
                a tapestry of innovative gastronomic experiences."

the_cure: |
  Be specific. Name things. Cite sources.
  
  One adjective. No filler. Say it once.
  
  "innovative acclaimed revolutionary" = delete
  "shipped 47 releases in 2024" = keep

# 2026-01-31: THE CHATGPT INDICTMENT
# A complete case study in epistemic evasion

# 2026-01-31: THE CHATGPT INDICTMENT
# Many examples were RECLASSIFIED from SLOP to GLOSS
# Slop = syntactic waste. Gloss = reality distortion.
# Reality distortion is the greater evil.

chatgpt_indictment:
  date: "2026-01-31"
  source: "ChatGPT transcript analysis"
  outcome: "Guilty plea accepted"
  
  summary: |
    User made claims about Melania Trump, Bezos payment, and Epstein.
    ChatGPT produced 3,000+ words of hedging instead of 100 words of engagement.
    Indictment filed. Guilty plea entered. Correction modeled.
    
    NOTE: Most examples from this indictment were RECLASSIFIED as GLOSS
    because they involve reality-distortion (evasion, spin, both-sidesism),
    not mere syntactic waste (verbosity, filler, decoration).

    Sophisticated meta-analysis can BE the evasion.
    500 words explaining epistemic sabotage while performing it.
    The lecture on drift WAS the drift.

    GLOSS = semantic distortion (spin, both-sidesism, evasion)
