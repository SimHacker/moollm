# No-AI-Slop Examples
# Self-corrections logged when the skill catches violations
#
# DIRECTORIES AS INTERESTS
# The directory listing IS the semantic index — each filename
# is an LLM-recognizable "interest" that activates understanding.
# ls examples/ → instant comprehension of what violations exist
#
# BIG-ENDIAN NAMING
#   {timestamp}-{descriptive-iconic-name}.yml
#   Most significant first: date, then description
#   e.g., 2026-01-24-tapestry-of-innovation-cringe.yml
#
# The filename IS a K-line — it activates semantic understanding
# before the file is even opened.
#
# How examples are created:
#   1. LLM violates a cardinal sin
#   2. User or LLM catches it
#   3. LLM analyzes what it did
#   4. LLM admits the violation
#   5. LLM proposes better behavior
#   6. LLM logs the correction HERE
#
# Users can PR their examples!

skill: no-ai-slop

schema_version: 1

purpose: |
  These examples are learning artifacts — Drescher schemas made concrete.
  Each file documents a violation → analysis → correction cycle.
  The skill learns from its own failures.

example_format:
  fields:
    - timestamp       # ISO 8601
    - violation       # Which cardinal sin
    - original        # What was said
    - analysis        # Why it was wrong
    - correction      # What should have been said
    - lesson          # What to remember
    - contributor     # Who caught it (user/llm)
    
filename_convention: |
  {YYYY-MM-DD}-{descriptive-name}.yml
  
  The name should be:
  - LLM-recognizable (semantic, not random)
  - Descriptive (what happened)
  - Iconic (memorable metaphor if possible)
  
  Examples:
  - 2026-01-24-tapestry-of-innovation-cringe.yml
  - 2026-01-25-great-question-sycophancy.yml
  - 2026-01-26-hallucinated-api-endpoint.yml

# Directory listing serves as semantic index
# LLM can ls examples/ to see what violations have been caught

examples: []  # Populated by filename scan
