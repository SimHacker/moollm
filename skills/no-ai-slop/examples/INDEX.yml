  the_regression_to_mush:
    # DEEP: Why this happens
    principle: |
      LLMs regress to the mean.
      
      Unusual fact → Generic positive description
      Specific person → "influential figure"
      Concrete number → "significant amount"
      Precise location → "nestled in the heart of"
      
      The subject becomes LESS SPECIFIC and MORE EXAGGERATED.
      
    example:
      original: "A diner in Newark that serves $4 sandwiches."
      slopped: "An acclaimed culinary establishment nestled in the 
                vibrant heart of a dynamic metropolitan area, serving
                a tapestry of innovative gastronomic experiences."

the_cure: |
  Be specific. Name things. Cite sources.
  
  One adjective. No filler. Say it once.
  
  "innovative acclaimed revolutionary" = delete
  "shipped 47 releases in 2024" = keep
