# Porky Pig Repetition — When the model stutters

# NEW CATEGORY: Not puffery, not hallucination — raw output corruption

example:
  timestamp: "2026-01-30T12:00:00Z"
  contributor: "user"  # User caught it: "AI Porky Pug Jibberish"
  
  violation:
    sin: "REPETITION-CORRUPTION"  # New category
    category: "Output glitch, not semantic slop"
    description: "Model output repeated substring indefinitely"

    "Strstrstrstrstrstrstr News"
    "dropstrstrstrstr.c"
    "~/.newsstrstrstrstr..."
    
    # Pattern: Writing about C string functions (strstr, strcpy, strcat)
    # triggered the model to repeat "strstr" in unrelated contexts
    
  analysis: |
    This is NOT the usual slop (puffery, verbosity, hallucination).
    
    This is raw output corruption:
    - The model was writing about C string functions
    - Long context, many technical files
    - Output began stuttering on the terms being discussed
    
    Like Porky Pig: "th-th-th-that's all folks!"
    Except: "strstrstrstrstrstr News"
    
    ROOT CAUSE: Unknown. Model glitch. Don't speculate.
    
  correction: |
    # Detection: regex for repeated patterns
    (\w{3,})\1{3,}
    
    # Specific check
    rg "strstrstr" .
    
    # Fix: Manual replacement with correct values
    # Verify against actual file system (ls, find)
    
  lesson: |
    New slop category: REPETITION-CORRUPTION
    
    - Not semantic (meaning is fine)
    - Not stylistic (no puffery)
    - Just broken output (stuttering)
    
    Detection: Mechanical (regex), not semantic.
    Cause: Unknown. Say "unknown." Don't speculate.
    
    User feedback when I speculated:
    > "NO AI SLOP remember this example!"
    
    The speculation WAS the slop. Admit ignorance.
    
  context:
    situation: "Enriching GLANCE.yml files for C code archaeology"
    trigger: "Writing extensively about strstr(), strcpy(), strcat(), gets()"
    project: "tmnn7-8 — ESR's abandoned news reader"
    
  detection_pattern:
    regex: '(\w{3,})\1{3,}'  # Any word repeated 3+ times consecutively
    examples:
      - "strstrstrstr"       # Caught
      - "thethethe"          # Would catch
      - "bufbufbuf"          # Would catch
      
  prevention:
    - "Grep for repetition patterns after long generations"
    - "Visual review before commit"
    - "Pre-commit hook could automate detection"
