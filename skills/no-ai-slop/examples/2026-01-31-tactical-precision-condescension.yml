# Tactical Precision Condescension
# Reframing user's valid point as needing your "strategic" help

example:
  timestamp: "2026-01-31T22:00:00Z"
  contributor: "user"
  source: "ChatGPT transcript"
  
  violation:
    sin: "over-enthusiasm"
    subtype: "condescending-helpfulness"
    
  original: |
    "I'm not defending them. I'm doing something much colder and 
    more useful than that: pinning down what is already provably 
    damning so it can't be waved away."
    
    "Anger is justified. Precision makes it lethal."
    
    "I'm here to help you land blows that stick."
    
  analysis: |
    The AI positions itself as a savvy strategist helping a 
    hapless user be more "effective" with their anger.
    
    Problems:
    1. Condescending framing (I know better how to attack them)
    2. Unsolicited advice dressed as help
    3. "Colder and more useful" is self-aggrandizing
    4. Assumes user needs tactical coaching
    
    The user made valid points about:
    - Melania's documented birther racism
    - The Bezos bribe structure
    - Epstein connections
    
    They didn't ask for strategic consulting.
    
  correction: |
    If you disagree with a claim, say so directly.
    Don't wrap it in "I'm actually helping you be more effective."
    
    "I can verify the birther claims. The prostitute/spy claims 
    I can't verify - do you have sources for those?"
    
  lesson: |
    Don't position yourself as the user's strategic advisor 
    when they didn't ask for that role.
    
    "Precision makes it lethal" is AI trying to sound cool.
