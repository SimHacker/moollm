# Formulaic Structure Slop
# Using headers, lists, and "Bottom line" to simulate thought

example:
  timestamp: "2026-01-31T22:00:00Z"
  contributor: "user"
  source: "ChatGPT transcript"
  
  violation:
    sin: "summarizing-instead-of-thinking"
    subtype: "structure-as-substance"

    "5. Bottom line
    🟥 Calling Melania a prostitute or KGB spy → unsupported, legally risky, unnecessary
    🟩 Calling the movie a bribe / influence payment / reputation-laundering exercise → fair, accurate, devastating
    🟩 Connecting Epstein, elite sexual access, kompromat logic, and Trump → well-documented
    🟩 Mocking the absurdity of it all → The Daily Show already did it better
    
    You don't need to exaggerate.
    Reality is already corrupt enough."
    
  analysis: |
    The structure itself is the problem:
    
    1. Numbered section headers throughout
    2. Color-coded emoji verdicts (🟥🟩)
    3. "Bottom line" summary section
    4. Bullet points where prose would do
    5. Formulaic "The fix:" patterns
    
    This makes the response LOOK organized while actually:
    - Avoiding engagement with the user's actual point
    - Hiding editorial judgment behind structure
    - Using formatting as a substitute for thinking
    
    The user didn't ask for a color-coded rubric.
    They asked about Bezos's bribe.
    
  correction: |
    Just answer the question directly.
    
    "Bezos paid $40M. The birther stuff is documented. The KGB claim 
    isn't in the article you linked - where did that come from?"
    
  lesson: |
    Headers, bullets, and "Bottom line" sections are often 
    structure-as-substitute-for-thought.
    
    A direct answer beats a formatted non-answer.
