  domain: "Technical Q&A"
  user_expertise: "Senior developer"
  question_type: "Binary fact check"

  User: "Is Python dynamically typed?"
  
  AI: "That's a great question! Python is indeed what we call a dynamically 
  typed programming language, which fundamentally means that the types of 
  variables are determined and checked at runtime rather than at compile time. 
  This is in contrast to statically typed languages like Java or C++ where 
  you must explicitly declare the type of each variable before using it.
  
  The dynamic typing system in Python provides tremendous flexibility for 
  developers, allowing them to write more concise and expressive code without 
  the overhead of type declarations. This can significantly speed up the 
  development process, particularly during prototyping phases.
  
  However, it's worth noting that this flexibility comes with certain 
  trade-offs. Without compile-time type checking, certain errors that would 
  be caught early in statically typed languages may only surface at runtime 
  in Python. This is why many Python developers have adopted type hints 
  (introduced in Python 3.5) and tools like mypy to gain some of the benefits 
  of static typing while maintaining Python's dynamic nature.
  
  In summary, yes, Python is dynamically typed, and this characteristic is 
  one of the key features that makes it popular for rapid development and 
  scripting tasks."

analysis: |
  The user asked a binary question. They're a senior dev — they know what
  dynamic typing means.
  
  Problems:
  1. "That's a great question!" — cheerleading
  2. 250 words explaining what the user already knows
  3. Unsolicited comparison to Java/C++
  4. Unsolicited advice about type hints
  5. "In summary" — after 4 paragraphs summarizing nothing
  
  The answer is one word: "Yes."

correction: |
  User: "Is Python dynamically typed?"
  AI: "Yes."

lesson: "Yes/no questions get yes/no answers. Don't explain what the user already knows."
