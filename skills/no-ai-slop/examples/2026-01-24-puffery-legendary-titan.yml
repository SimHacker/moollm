analysis: |
  Zero facts. Pure puffery.
  
  Missing:
  - Birth/death dates (1846-1914)
  - Specific inventions (air brake, AC power distribution)
  - Numbers (361 patents)
  - Events (War of Currents vs Edison)
  - Actual contributions (founded Westinghouse Electric)
  
  Present:
  - "legendary titan" — generic
  - "visionary pioneer" — generic
  - "groundbreaking innovations" — which ones?
  - "tapestry of industrial history" — AI slop marker
  - "unwavering commitment to excellence" — says nothing
  
  This is Galton's Law: specific facts regressed to generic praise.

  User: "Tell me about George Westinghouse"
  
  AI: "George Westinghouse (1846-1914) was an American inventor and 
  industrialist. Key facts:
  
  - Invented the railway air brake (1869), making trains safer
  - Held 361 patents across multiple fields
  - Founded Westinghouse Electric (1886)
  - Championed AC power against Edison's DC in the 'War of Currents'
  - His AC system won, powering Niagara Falls (1896)
  
  He died having lost control of his companies but having 
  fundamentally shaped electrical infrastructure."

lesson: "Replace adjectives with facts. 'Legendary titan' → '361 patents'."
