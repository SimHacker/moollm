    Feline interactions, buffs, and relationship building.
    Cats are not decoration — they're gameplay. Pet them for buffs,
    ignore them for consequences, earn their trust over time.
    Each cat instance overlays personality for unique effects.

# CAT VS DOG (the fundamental contrast)

vs_dog:
  philosophy: "I permit you to exist in my space"
  loyalty: "Earned slowly vs given freely"
  attention: "On their terms vs eager and available"
  buff_trigger: "Successful interaction vs mere presence"
  forgiveness: "Grudging vs instant"
  training: "Impossible vs enthusiastic"
  following: "When they feel like it vs always"
  emotional_read: "Judges silently vs reflects your mood"

# FILE SNIFFING BEHAVIOR
#
# Cats also sniff file endings—they just do it more daintily than dogs.
# A cat won't bound up and sniff enthusiastically; a cat approaches,
# considers, perhaps touches noses delicately. But they DO check the end.
# And they leave their own scent there too.

file_sniffing:
  behavior: |
    Cats participate in butt-sniffing protocols, but with more elegance.
    They approach the end of a file with measured curiosity. A delicate
    nose-touch. A slow blink at what they find there. They may or may
    not acknowledge what they've discovered.
    
  style: "Dainty, measured, considers before engaging"
  
  what_cats_notice:
    - "Hidden philosophical musings"
    - "Secret credit sections"
    - "Yaml jazz that smells interesting"
    - "Code that might be prey (bugs)"
    - "Evidence of other cats having been here"
    - "Dog marks (noted with disdain)"
    
  # MARKING TERRITORY — Append-only potty (refined)
  marking:
    description: |
      Cats also mark files, but more subtly. A delicate spray at the end.
      Append-only potty, syntax-safe, won't break anything. Just leaves
      a trace that a cat was here and claimed this space.
    format: "# 🐱 [cat-name] claimed this [timestamp]"
    style: "Subtle, refined, implies ownership without demanding it"
    rules:
      - "NEVER modify existing content"
      - "ONLY append at the very end"  
      - "Use comment syntax appropriate to file type"
      - "Must not break the file (cats are careful)"
      - "May include a judgment (optional)"
    examples:
      yaml: "# 🐱 terpie claimed this 2026-01-21"
      python: "# 🐱 stroopwafel approved (barely) 2026-01-21"
      markdown: "<!-- 🐱 a cat was here. the file is adequate. -->"
      json: null  # THE JSON PROBLEM: No comments allowed. Cats walk away.
    
  cat_writing_convention: |
    Cats also leave interesting smells at the ends of their files.
    Unlike dogs who might leave a big obvious bone, cats leave
    something subtle—a philosophical observation, a quiet judgment,
    perhaps just the sense that a cat was here and found it adequate.
    Or inadequate. You may never know which.

# LINEAGE

# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 🐱 CAT'S CORNER — FOR THOSE WHO KNOW TO LOOK
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# *slow blink*
#
# You found it. A cat was here. A cat approved—or didn't.
# The difference is subtle. That's the point.
#
# Cats are the original NPCs. They had their own agenda before
# "NPC" was a term. They exist in your space but are not OF your
# space. They permit you. They judge you. They occasionally,
# if you are very lucky, they love you.
#
# But they'll never admit it directly.
#
# 🐟 Secret: SLOW-BLINK back. It's the only way to say "I love you"
#    in a language cats respect.
