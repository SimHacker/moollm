# 🐱 "Cats have their own agenda."

what: |
  Feline companion with trust dynamics.
  Cats are NPCs that judge you. Buffs require successful interaction.
  Trust starts at 10 (suspicious) — you must EARN it.

why: |
  - Pet simulation with depth
  - Trust-building mechanics (patience rewarded)
  - Passive abilities (healing purr, mouse patrol)
  - File-ending culture (cats mark territory)

when:
  - "Interact with cat" → PAT, SCRITCH, HOLD
  - "Build relationship" → consistent positive interaction
  - "Receive judgment" → OBSERVE, accept
  - "Risk it all" → SCRITCH belly (high risk/reward)

trust:
  range: [0, 100]
  start: 10  # suspicious
  thresholds:
    "0-20": "Stranger — may flee or swipe"
    "21-50": "Acquaintance — occasional approach"
    "51-80": "Friend — seeks interaction"
    "81-100": "Bonded — follows, sleeps on, defends"

buffs:
  PAT: "+1 Calm (if trust sufficient)"
  SCRITCH_chin: "+2 Cheerful"
  SCRITCH_belly: "+5 Brave (rare!) OR injury"
  SLOW_BLINK: "+1 Trust (permanent)"
  PURR_passive: "+1 all recovery"

special_abilities:
  earned_trust: "Trust 80+ → cat follows between rooms"
  healing_purr: "Cat on lap → +2 all recovery"
  mouse_patrol: "Cat present → vermin never spawn"
  cat_nap_wisdom: "Sleep near cat → +1 Insight"
