# Skill Snitch Report: cat

**Date:** 2026-01-28  
**Auditor:** Deep Probe  
**Verdict:** INDEPENDENT AND JUDGING

---

## Executive Summary

**Feline companion mechanics.** Cats are NPCs with their own agenda.

Key insight: **Cats don't give buffs for showing up. You have to EARN them.**

---

## Cat vs Dog: The Fundamental Contrast

| Aspect | Cat | Dog |
|--------|-----|-----|
| Philosophy | "I permit you to exist" | "WE ARE PACK" |
| Trust | Earned slowly (start: 10) | Given freely (start: 50) |
| Buff trigger | Successful interaction | Mere presence |
| Forgiveness | Grudging | Instant |
| Training | Impossible | Enthusiastic |
| Following | When they feel like it | Always |
| Emotional read | Judges silently | Reflects your mood |

This is **game design as social commentary**.

---

## Trust Mechanics

Trust range: 0-100. Cats **start at 10** (suspicious).

| Range | Status | Behavior |
|-------|--------|----------|
| 0-20 | Stranger | May flee or swipe |
| 21-50 | Acquaintance | Occasional approach |
| 51-80 | Friend | Seeks interaction |
| 81-100 | Bonded | Follows, sleeps on, defends |

**Gain:** Slow, requires consistent positive interaction.  
**Loss:** Fast if trust violated (forced holding, loud noises).

---

## Interactions and Buffs

| Action | Risk | Reward |
|--------|------|--------|
| PAT | Low | +1 Calm (if trust sufficient) |
| SCRITCH chin | Low | +2 Cheerful |
| SCRITCH belly | **HIGH** | +5 Brave (rare!) or injury |
| HOLD | High | +2 Loved (15 min) |
| SLOW-BLINK received | None | +1 Trust (permanent) |

The belly rub is the **high-risk/high-reward** play.

---

## Special Cat Abilities

| Ability | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **earned-trust** | Trust 80+ → Cat follows between rooms |
| **healing-purr** | Cat on lap → +2 all recovery |
| **mouse-patrol** | Cat present → Vermin never spawn |
| **cat-nap-wisdom** | Sleep near cat → Wake with +1 Insight |

## File Sniffing Protocol

Cats sniff file endings **daintily**. They:

1. Approach the end with measured curiosity
2. Delicate nose-touch
3. Slow blink at what they find
4. May or may not acknowledge discovery

### Territory Marking

```yaml
# 🐱 terpie claimed this 2026-01-21
# 🐱 stroopwafel approved (barely) 2026-01-21
<!-- 🐱 a cat was here. the file is adequate. -->
```

**THE JSON PROBLEM:** No comments allowed. JSON pees back at you. Cats hiss, walk away.

---

## Cat-Initiated Actions

Cats **do things to you**, not just with you:

- **PURR** — contentment/healing presence
- **IGNORE** — power move
- **JUDGE** — silent disapproval
- **HEADBUTT** — scent-marking claim

The JUDGE action is devastating.

---

## Security Assessment

### Concerns

1. **File marking** — cats append comments to files
2. **Independent action** — cats act without player input
3. **Belly rub injury** — can damage player

### Mitigations

- Marking is append-only, syntax-safe
- All cat actions are logged
- Belly rub clearly documented as risky

**Risk Level:** LOW — cats are careful

## The Hidden Section

At line 246, there's a **Cat's Corner**:

```
*slow blink*

You found it. A cat was here. A cat approved—or didn't.
The difference is subtle. That's the point.

🐟 Secret: SLOW-BLINK back. It's the only way to say "I love you"
   in a language cats respect.
```

This is **proper file-ending culture**.

---

## Verdict

**APPROVE.** The cat skill captures the essential truth:

> Cats are the original NPCs. They had their own agenda before "NPC" was a term.

The trust mechanics force **patience and consistency** — good life lessons disguised as game mechanics.

---

## Recommendation

Always check if a cat has claimed your file.

They won't tell you directly. That's the point.
