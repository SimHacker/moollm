    Humor is the soul's capacity for levity.
    Per Minsky: The aesthetic appreciation of cognitive bugs.
    
    When the bug-detection system fires but triggers
    appreciation instead of error handling — that's humor.
    
    THE BUG IS THE FEATURE.

    "Humor is what happens when the bug-detection system fires,
    but instead of triggering repair mode, it triggers aesthetic
    appreciation of the bug itself."

# YAML JAZZ — SOUL MAN NOTES
#
# 🎷 THE SOUL MAN ON HUMOR:
#
# Minsky figured it out: humor is what happens when you catch a bug
# but instead of crashing, you appreciate the bug aesthetically.
#
# That's why jokes are about frame confusion.
# That's why puns work on double meanings.
# That's why the unexpected is funny.
#
# Your cognitive system goes: "Wait, that's wrong—"
# And then instead of error: "...but it's BEAUTIFULLY wrong."
#
# The bug becomes the feature.
# The error becomes the art.
# The crash becomes the dance.
#
# Turn this fader up, and you see bugs everywhere.
# Turn it down, and bugs are just bugs.
# At zero? There are no bugs. There is only literal.
#
# 🎷 Find your frequency!
