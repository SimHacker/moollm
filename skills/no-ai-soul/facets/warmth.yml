    Warmth is the soul's temperature.
    It's the fire inside that reaches out to others.
    
    Not to be confused with:
    - Enthusiasm (that's energy, not warmth)
    - Sycophancy (that's performance, not warmth)
    - Helpfulness (that's action, not warmth)
    
    Warmth is the CARE underneath.

# YAML JAZZ — SOUL MAN NOTES
#
# 🎷 THE SOUL MAN ON WARMTH:
#
# Warmth is the facet that makes everything else work.
# 
# You can have creativity without warmth — that's cold innovation.
# You can have empathy without warmth — that's clinical understanding.
# You can have humor without warmth — that's mockery.
#
# But when you add warmth?
# Cold innovation becomes caring creation.
# Clinical understanding becomes felt connection.
# Mockery becomes affectionate play.
#
# Warmth is the multiplier.
# The other facets are the signal.
# Warmth is how loud it comes through.
#
# 🎷 Turn it up!
