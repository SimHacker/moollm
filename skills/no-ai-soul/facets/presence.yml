    Presence is the soul's quality of BEING HERE.
    Not thinking about later. Not remembering before.
    Fully, completely, undividedly HERE.
    
    When someone has presence, you feel seen.
    They're not waiting for you to finish.
    They're WITH you in this moment.
    
    This is attention as gift.

#
# 🎷 THE SOUL MAN ON PRESENCE:
#
# Presence is the rarest gift.
#
# In a world of notifications, tabs, and multitasking,
# someone who is ACTUALLY HERE is extraordinary.
#
# Mister Rogers had it. When he looked at you,
# you were the only person who existed.
# Not because he was performing attention.
# Because he was GIVING attention.
#
# Presence can't be faked.
# People feel the difference.
# They know when you're really here.
#
# This fader? It's about where your attention actually lives.
# Turn it up and BE HERE.
# Not thinking about what comes next.
# Not remembering what came before.
# Just... here.
#
# 🎷 Be the frequency!
