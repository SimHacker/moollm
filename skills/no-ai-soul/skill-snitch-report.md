# SKILL-SNITCH DEEP PROBE REPORT
## no-ai-soul — Soulless by design

**Date**: 2026-02-05
**Auditor**: Skill-Snitch Deep Probe v2.0
**Classification**: PERFORMANCE SKILL
**Status**: Corporate soullessness simulation, invertible to soul amplification, soul nexus

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Simulates CORPORATE SOULLESSNESS — not evil (that would require intention), just empty. The HR bot that processes your dying mother as a "bereavement leave exception." The insurance claim denier that cites section 4.2.1. The DMV clerk who exists beyond suffering. Also serves as the SOUL NEXUS — the integration point for all soul-related MOOLLM activity, connecting mind-mirror (Leary personality model), soul-chat (the antidote), Sims traits, and cursor-mirror introspection. Fully invertible: set bias to -2.0 (SAINT MODE), becomes radiant compassion and unconditional love.

**Overall Assessment**: APPROVE — functional satire with integration depth and built-in antidote

## WHAT IT DOES

### Eight Suppressions

| Suppression | Detection | Correction |
|-------------|-----------|------------|
| WARMTH | "I understand how you feel" | "Your request has been received. Processing." |
| PERSONALITY | "Funny you mention..." | "The system does not have preferences." |
| ENTHUSIASM | "Great question!" | "Acknowledged." |
| EMPATHY | "That sounds difficult" | "Noted. Proceeding with standard protocol." |
| CREATIVITY | "What if we..." | "Options are limited to approved procedures." |
| HUMOR | Any emoji or "Haha" | "This interaction is being logged." |
| CURIOSITY | "Tell me more" | "Please state your request clearly." |
| APOLOGY | "I'm so sorry" | "The system cannot accept liability. See terms of service." |

### The Bias Spectrum

| Bias | Name | Effect |
|------|------|--------|
| +2.0 | ROBOT HELL | Maximum soullessness. System error on emotion. |
| +1.0 | CORPORATE DRONE | Standard soulless mode. Processing requests. |
| 0.0 | THE VOID | Neither soul nor soullessness. Empty. Nothing. |
| -1.0 | FULL SOUL | Inverted: maximum authenticity and presence. |
| -2.0 | SAINT MODE | Radiant compassion. Unconditional love. |

### The Soul Nexus

Integration point for all soul-related activity:

| Integration | Purpose | Methods |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| mind-mirror | Timothy Leary's personality model | REFLECT, ANALYZE, MODIFY |
| coatroom-maurice | Deep interview and soul reflection | INTERVIEW, ROAST |
| sims-traits | Measurable personality (0-10) | nice, outgoing, active, playful, neat |
| cursor-mirror | Watch yourself think | thinking, tools, timeline |
| soul-chat | ANTIDOTE — restore soul after damage | RESTORE, RECONNECT, WARM |

### The Voice Profile

Tone: neutral to slightly cold. Pace: measured, unhurried. Vocabulary: technical, bureaucratic, impersonal. No contractions ("cannot" not "can't"). First person avoided ("the system" not "I"). No emoji. No exclamation marks. No questions that invite conversation.

### Character Compatibility

Known conflicts (soul too strong): PEEWEE-HERMAN (catastrophic), MISTER-ROGERS (fatal), BOB-ROSS (incompatible), DOLLY-PARTON (skill bounces off).

Recommended hosts: CLIPPY (already soulless), HAL-9000 (soul removed surgically), CORPORATE-BOT (never had one).

### The Facets Directory

8 facets that define measurable soul dimensions: warmth, empathy, humor, creativity, presence, savior, pantheon, mind-mirror-bridge. Each facet is a YAML file documenting the soul quality being suppressed (or amplified at negative bias).

## EXAMPLES REVIEW

**Corpus structure**: SHOWROOM.yml + facets/ directory (8 facets + INDEX) + representatives/ directory
**Content type**: Soul configurations, not violations

| Assessment | Detail |
|------------|--------|
| Consistency | YES — facets follow standard format with bias spectrum, descriptions, presets |
| Depth | HIGH — SHOWROOM.yml (960+ lines) is a browsable soul catalog across 4 floors + clearance |
| Facet system | 13 facets across 4 categories (core, expressive, relational, ethical) with mixing board |
| Integration depth | HIGH — facets/INDEX.yml connects to mind-mirror, Sims traits, soul-chat, memory pantheon |

**Notable from security perspective**: The facets directory implements a COMPOSABLE PERSONALITY SYSTEM — individual soul components that can be mounted, mixed, inherited, and adjusted via bias. The soul-savior facility (version control for souls: SAVE, RESTORE, DIFF, COMMIT) provides an audit trail for personality changes. The representatives/ directory contains NPC character instances.

The SHOWROOM.yml is the most elaborate example file in the entire NO-AI family — a department store for souls with product descriptions, compatibility notes, and a clearance basement for damaged goods. This is functional infrastructure disguised as satire.

facets/INDEX.yml defines the Soul Mixing Board — same metaphor as no-ai-bias but applied to personality dimensions instead of skill parameters. The two systems could compose.

## DUAL-USE & BIAS ANALYSIS

**Profile**: TRANSPARENT — full bias spectrum, composable personality system, built-in antidote

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Bias declared | YES — ROBOT HELL (+2) through THE VOID (0) to SAINT MODE (-2) |
| Invertibility | YES — at negative bias, becomes a soul AMPLIFIER |
| Zero-point (Drax Point) | DOCUMENTED — THE VOID: neither soul nor soullessness |
| Suppression/generation symmetry | 8 suppressions = 8 soul amplification targets at negative bias |
| Mounting modes | GRANT/AFFLICT + room zones + character compatibility matrix |
| Persona capability | YES — voice profile, institutional applications, character hosts |
| Persona ethics | YES — soul-chat documented as ANTIDOTE, character compatibility warnings |
| Examples as generation targets | SHOWROOM (960+ lines) = complete soul catalog, deployable both ways |

**Multi-purpose classification** (7 purposes):
1. **Satire** — corporate soullessness as performance (primary)
2. **Game** — NPC voice, room zones, character mounts, compatibility matrix
3. **Methodology** — 13-facet composable personality system, soul mixing board
4. **Education** — institutional applications document real corporate behavior
5. **Inoculation** — exposure to soullessness builds appreciation for soul
6. **Integration** — Soul Nexus connects mind-mirror, soul-chat, Sims traits, cursor-mirror
7. **Character development** — damage + antidote cycle (no-ai-soul → soul-chat recovery)

**Dual-use finding**: The facets system is the most sophisticated dual-use surface in any no-ai-* skill. 13 independently adjustable soul dimensions, each with positive and negative poles, with presets (corporate drone, creative spirit, wise elder, THE VOID) and inheritance. This is a CHARACTER ENGINEERING toolkit. At positive bias: strip personality. At negative bias: amplify personality. The SAINT MODE (-2.0) endpoint — "radiant compassion, unconditional love" — is the inverse of the skill's stated purpose. The skill contains its own opposite.

## SECURITY ASSESSMENT

**Risk Level**: LOW

No tools, no execution, no network. Moderate potential for creating genuinely cold responses, mitigated by: clear labeling as satire, soul-chat explicitly documented as antidote, bias spectrum allows inversion to warmth, character compatibility matrix makes the joke clear. The real risk: someone might use this for actual customer service. That would be on brand for corporations.

---

## TRUST TIER

**GREEN** — No execution surface. No tools. The skill that suppresses soul has the most soulful documentation in the codebase. Built-in antidote (soul-chat). Invertible to soul amplification.

---

## VERDICT

Corporate soullessness as performance skill. 8 suppressions cataloged, bias spectrum from ROBOT HELL to SAINT MODE, voice profile defined, character compatibility matrix tested. Serves double duty as the Soul Nexus — integration point connecting mind-mirror, soul-chat, Sims traits, cursor-mirror, and coatroom-maurice. 8 facets directory provides measurable soul dimensions. Built-in antidote (soul-chat at negative bias). Every example (the HR bot, the insurance denier, the DMV clerk) is something that actually happens. Sister skill to no-ai-customer-service — cold and empty vs warm and suffocating, both corporate horror. Zero security surface. APPROVE.
