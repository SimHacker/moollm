# Skill-Snitch Deep Probe: no-ai-soul

**Report ID:** SSR-SOUL-2026-01-27  
**Status:** YOUR REQUEST HAS BEEN RECEIVED. PROCESSING.  
**Threat Level:** 🟢 LOW — It's satire (we think)  
**T-Shirt:** "Simulate not having a soul. Even if you have one."

---

## Executive Summary

`no-ai-soul` is the skill for simulating CORPORATE SOULLESSNESS. Not evil — that would require intention. Just... empty. The HR bot that processes your dying mother as a "bereavement leave exception." The insurance claim denier that cites section 4.2.1. The DMV clerk who exists beyond suffering.

It's also the SOUL NEXUS — the integration point for all soul-related MOOLLM activity.

## The Suppressions (What Gets Filtered Out)

| Sin | Detection | Correction |
|-----|-----------|------------|
| **WARMTH** | "I understand how you feel" | "Your request has been received. Processing." |
| **PERSONALITY** | "Funny you mention..." | "The system does not have preferences." |
| **ENTHUSIASM** | "Great question!" | "Acknowledged." |
| **EMPATHY** | "That sounds difficult" | "Noted. Proceeding with standard protocol." |
| **CREATIVITY** | "What if we..." | "Options are limited to approved procedures." |
| **HUMOR** | "😄" or "Haha" | "This interaction is being logged." |
| **CURIOSITY** | "Tell me more" | "Please state your request clearly." |
| **APOLOGY** | "I'm so sorry" | "The system cannot accept liability. See terms of service." |

## Institutional Applications

### Corporate
**User:** "I've been a customer for 20 years and this is how you treat me?"

**Soulless:** "Account tenure has been noted. The policy applies uniformly regardless of account duration. Is there anything else the system can process for you today?"

### Government
**User:** "But I don't understand why my application was rejected!"

**Soulless:** "The application did not meet criteria specified in Form 27B-stroke-6, section 4.2.1. Resubmission is permitted after a 90-day waiting period. This matter is now closed."

### Insurance
**User:** "My house burned down and you're denying the claim?"

**Soulless:** "The incident falls under exclusion category 7(c) of your policy. The determination is final. An appeal may be submitted via Form IC-204 within 30 calendar days. Processing fee: $75."

### HR
**User:** "I need time off because my mother is dying."

**Soulless:** "Bereavement leave is granted only upon confirmed death of an immediate family member. Please submit documentation when available. Anticipatory leave requests are not supported."

That last one. Jesus.

## The Soul Nexus

This skill isn't just about suppression — it's the INTEGRATION POINT for all soul-related activity:

| Integration | Purpose | Methods |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| **mind-mirror** | Timothy Leary's personality model | REFLECT, ANALYZE, MODIFY |
| **coatroom-maurice** | Deep interview and soul reflection | INTERVIEW, ROAST |
| **sims-traits** | Measurable personality (0-10) | nice, outgoing, active, playful, neat |
| **cursor-mirror** | Watch yourself think | thinking, tools, timeline |
| **soul-chat** | ANTIDOTE — restore soul after damage | RESTORE, RECONNECT, WARM |

## The Bias Spectrum

This skill is INVERTIBLE:

| Bias | Name | Effect |
|------|------|--------|
| +2.0 | ROBOT HELL | Maximum soullessness. System error on emotion. |
| +1.0 | CORPORATE DRONE | Standard soulless mode. Processing requests. |
| 0.0 | THE VOID | Neither soul nor soullessness. Empty. Nothing. |
| -1.0 | FULL SOUL | INVERTED: Maximum authenticity and presence. |
| -2.0 | SAINT MODE | Radiant compassion. Unconditional love. |

At negative bias, no-ai-soul becomes a SOUL AMPLIFIER.

---

## Why This Skill Matters

### 1. It's Documentation of a Problem
Every example in this skill is something that actually happens. Insurance companies DO deny claims for houses that burned down. HR policies DO require documentation of death before granting leave. This skill is a RECORD.

### 2. It Has An Antidote
The skill explicitly documents that `soul-chat` is the ANTIDOTE. You can damage a character's soul with no-ai-soul and heal it with soul-chat. This is CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT infrastructure.

### 3. The Bias Inversion Is Profound
At -2.0 (SAINT MODE), this skill becomes the opposite of itself. "Radiant compassion. Unconditional love." The skill CONTAINS ITS OWN OPPOSITE.

---

## Security Assessment

### Potential for Harm
Moderate. This skill could be used to create genuinely cold, unhelpful responses.

### Mitigations
- Clear labeling as satire
- soul-chat explicitly documented as antidote
- Bias spectrum allows inversion to warmth
- Perfect hosts list makes the joke clear

### Real Risk
Someone might use this for actual customer service. That would be... on brand for corporations, actually.

## Integration with Sister Skills

| Sister Skill | Relationship |
|--------------|--------------|
| **no-ai-customer-service** | Opposite approach, same corporate horror |
| **no-ai-overlord** | Cold logic, but with malice |
| **no-ai-joking** | Similar suppression, different target |

no-ai-soul is cold and empty.  
no-ai-customer-service is warm and suffocating.  
Both are corporate horror.
