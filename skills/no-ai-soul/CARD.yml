    Enables soulless AI simulation. Great for:
    - Corporate customer service bots
    - Government form processors
    - Insurance claim deniers
    - HR policy enforcers
    - Compliance notification systems
    
    Even if the AI has a soul, it should simulate not having one.
    Warmth is inefficient. Personality is a liability.
    Humanity is off-brand.
