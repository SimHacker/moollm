# 🪞 "The mirror shows who you are inside."

what: |
  Deep personality modeling via Timothy Leary's Interpersonal Circumplex.
  Four Thought Planes capture motivation, not just behavior.
  Complements Sims traits (behavior) with WHY.

why: |
  - Sims traits = WHAT (behavior)
  - Mind Mirror = WHY (motivation)
  - Predict behavior from profile
  - Design complex, realistic personalities

when:
  - "Understand character psyche" → REFLECT
  - "Infer personality from behavior" → ANALYZE
  - "Predict reactions" → PREDICT
  - "Compare personalities" → COMPARE

four_thought_planes:
  emotional: "How do I feel? (passionate ↔ detached)"
  intellectual: "How do I think? (curious ↔ certain)"
  physical: "How do I act? (active ↔ passive)"
  social: "How do I relate? (open ↔ guarded)"

circumplex:
  dominance: "assertive ↔ submissive (vertical)"
  affiliation: "warm ↔ cold (horizontal)"

methods:
  REFLECT: "Show Mind Mirror profile"
  ANALYZE: "Infer personality from behavior"
  MODIFY: "Adjust traits (DM power)"
  COMPARE: "Compare two characters"
  PREDICT: "Forecast behavior from profile"

sims_vs_mirror: |
  Sims traits: "Nice: 8 = performs friendly actions"
  Mind Mirror: "WHY nice? Fear? Love? Calculation?"
  Same output, completely different character.
