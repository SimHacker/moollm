# USAGE IN CHARACTER FILES
#
# Characters define ONLY the properties that shape them.
# A few vivid extremes beat 32 mediocre fours.
#
#   mind_mirror:
#     calm: 7             # The still point of the turning pub
#     well_informed: 7    # Sees patterns. Says little.
#     practical: 7        # More depth than he shows
#     friendly: 6         # Notices who's struggling. Doesn't say.
#     restless: 1         # Third stool. Why move?
#     unsophisticated: 1  # Doesn't need validation. Has espresso.
#
# That's Henk. Six properties. You know him.

# THE MODEL

model:
  timothy-leary: |
    Timothy Leary (1957) developed the Interpersonal
    Circumplex: a 2D model of personality based on
    dominance (vertical) and affiliation (horizontal).

  four-planes: |
    BIO_ENERGY:  How alive do I feel? (burning ↔ still)
    EMOTIONAL:   How do I approach others? (open ↔ guarded)
    MENTAL:      How do I process the world? (intuitive ↔ systematic)
    SOCIAL:      How do I fit with others? (solo ↔ together)

  flat-format: |
    Properties are FLAT in character files, not nested under planes.
    Each property carries its plane in the registry above.
    UI reconstructs the grouping. LLM reads the jazz.
    Only define what matters. Omitted = neutral (4).

  complement-to-sims: |
    Sims traits (nice, outgoing, active, playful, neat)
    capture BEHAVIOR — what they DO.
    Mind Mirror captures MOTIVATION — why they do it.
    Together: complete personality picture.
