# MIND-MIRROR
# Personality modeling system based on Timothy Leary's 1985 software
# "Mirrors should reflect a little before throwing back images." - Jean Cocteau

skill:
  name: Mind Mirror
  type: personality_modeling
  priority: COGNITIVE
  
  origin:
    creator: "Timothy Leary"
    programmers: ["Peter Van den Beemt", "Bob Dietz"]
    publisher: "Electronic Arts (Futique, Inc.)"
    year: 1985
    platforms: ["Apple ][", "Commodore 64", "IBM PC"]
    
  foundation: |
    Based on Leary's PhD dissertation "The Social Dimensions of Personality"
    and the Interpersonal Behavior Circle (Leary Circumplex).
    
    Leary designed personality assessments before LSD.
    He escaped prison using his own test — answered to appear low-risk.
    Your self-knowledge is your most powerful tool.
    
  purpose: |
    Structured framework for modeling personalities:
    - Self-reflection (current vs ideal self)
    - Character creation (rich, dimensional NPCs)
    - Empathy exploration (role-play through perspectives)
    - Comparison (any two personalities)

# THE FOUR THOUGHT PLANES
# Each plane is a circle of 8 dimensions
# Each dimension has inner (moderate) and outer (extreme) words

# INTERACTION MODES

interaction_modes:
  AUTO_PLAY: "System guides you through"
  INTER_PLAY: "Mirror your own thoughts, compare with others"

# K-LINE INTEGRATION

k_line_mapping: |
  Each Mind Mirror dimension IS a K-line:
  
  Type "CONFIDENT" → activates:
    - Charismatic (extreme form)
    - Part of EMOTIONAL_INSIGHT plane
    - Opposite of Timid
    - Associated speech patterns and behaviors
    
  Mind Mirror profiles are structured K-line bundles.

# MOOLLM INTEGRATION

integration:
  
  character_profiles: |
    Every character can have a Mind Mirror profile.
    Abbreviated: just list the extreme traits.
    Full: all 32 dimensions rated 0-7.
    
  soul_chat_influence: |
    Mind Mirror dimensions affect how characters speak:
    - calm → speaks slowly, pauses
    - confident → never apologizes unnecessarily
    - creative → uses unusual metaphors
    - uninhibited → occasionally vulgar
    
  adventure_npcs: |
    NPC Mind Mirror profiles affect:
    - How they respond to player
    - What advertisements they generate
    - Decision-making in simulations
    
  coatroom_modification: |
    Costumes can modify Mind Mirror dimensions.
    Wearing a cape might boost "confident" by 2.

# REPRESENTATION ETHICS

ethics: |
  Mind Mirror profiles are MODELS, not CLAIMS.
  
  Creating a profile for a real person:
  - Base on documented traits only
  - Cite sources
  - Mark as "profile" not "person"
  - This is tradition invocation, not impersonation
  
  Original disclaimer (1985):
  "All statements attributed to living persons are fictional;
  they are intended as gentle satire and provocative humor.
  In no case is there any implication that the statements
  reflect the true sentiments of the 'alleged' speaker."
