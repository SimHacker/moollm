# 🚪 "A room is a directory with atmosphere."

what: |
  Foundational spatial metaphor. Directories ARE rooms.
  Rooms have contents, exits, atmosphere.
  Navigation is movement. Location provides context.

why: |
  - Everything has a location
  - Location provides context for behavior
  - World-building with @DIG, @OPEN, @LINK
  - Navigate instead of "read files"

when:
  - "Go somewhere" → ENTER, EXIT
  - "Create space" → @DIG, @OPEN
  - "Understand location" → LOOK, CONTENTS
  - "Build world" → @GENERATE, @POPULATE

player_commands:
  LOOK: "See room description + contents"
  ENTER: "Enter a room"
  EXIT: "Leave via direction"
  CONTENTS: "List what's here"
  ADVERTISE: "Show available actions"

builder_commands:
  "@DIG": "Create room"
  "@OPEN": "Create exit"
  "@LINK": "Connect exit to destination"
  "@DESCRIBE": "Set room description"
  "@LOCK": "Restrict passage"
  "@TELEPORT": "Builder power — instant travel"

world_generation:
  "@GENERATE": "maze, dungeon, building, tree"
  "@POPULATE": "Add inhabitants"
  "@THEME": "Apply atmosphere"

room_types:
  physical: "Normal navigable space"
  metaphysical: "Conceptual space (personas/)"
  container: "Nested room (bag of holding)"
  vehicle: "Room that moves (TARDIS)"
  repository: "Storage collection"

anti_pattern: "ASCII maps — fragile, wastes tokens. Use markdown tables."
