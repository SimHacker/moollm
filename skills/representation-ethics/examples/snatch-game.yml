# snatch-game.yml — The Drag Celebrity Tribute Precedent
#
# RuPaul's Snatch Game as ethical model for celebrity impersonation.

snatch_game_precedent:
  
  what_it_is:
    - Drag queens "playing" celebrities
    - Comedic impersonation in game show format
    - Punny names optional but common
    - Explicitly framed as performance
    
  why_its_ethical:
    - The TV show format declares "this is a game"
    - Audience knows it's drag queens playing characters
    - Celebrates the originals through homage
    - No one is deceived about identity
    
  famous_examples:
    - "Chad Michaels as Cher (tribute artist, not claim to BE)"
    - "Jinkx Monsoon as Little Edie"
    - "BenDeLaCreme as Maggie Smith"
    - "Bob the Drag Queen as Uzo Aduba as Crazy Eyes"
    
  in_moollm:
    naming: "Pun names (Cher-ity Case) or 'as' construction (Chad as Cher)"
    context: "Theatrical, drag, tribute, snatch-game"
    safety: "HIGH — the drag context IS the framing"

# NAMING CONVENTIONS THAT SELF-DECLARE

naming_conventions:
  
  pun_on_name:
    example: "Cher-ity Case"
    why_safe: "Obviously not the real person"
    
  as_construction:
    example: "Chad Michaels as Cher"
    why_safe: "Declares performance explicitly"
    
  tribute_label:
    example: "Dolly Parton Tribute Act"
    why_safe: "The word 'tribute' frames it"
    
  impersonator_label:
    example: "Celebrity Impersonator Night"
    why_safe: "'Impersonator' = not-the-person"

# THE PRINCIPLE

principle: |
  When the name or label declares fiction, no additional framing needed.
  The label IS the ethical protection.
  
  "Elvis Impersonator" — the word 'impersonator' IS the disclosure.
  "Cher-ity Case" — the pun name IS the disclosure.
  "Tribute Band" — the word 'tribute' IS the disclosure.
