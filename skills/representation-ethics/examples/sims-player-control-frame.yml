# The Sims Player Control Frame
# Ethical framing based on The Sims' successful approach to simulation ethics

meta:
  example_type: simulation_frame
  inspired_by: "The Sims (2000)"
  heritage: "Will Wright, Maxis"
  
context: |
  The Sims demonstrated that simulating people can be:
  - Safe: when clearly gamified (cartoon characters)
  - Empowering: LGBTQ+ players explored identity safely
  - Revelatory: exposed assumptions about domestic life
  
  Key insight: Player agency makes simulation ethical.
  The player decides what happens. The player is responsible.

# THE SIMS PATTERN
# What made The Sims ethically successful?

sims_ethics_principles:
  
  # 1. PLAYER CONTROL
  player_agency:
    principle: "The player is always in control"
    implementation:
      - player_directs_actions: true
      - player_chooses_relationships: true
      - player_decides_outcomes: true
      - simulation_serves_player: true
      
    moollm_equivalent:
      frame: PLAYER_CONTROLLED
      human_commitment: required
      
  # 2. GAMIFICATION AS SAFETY
  gamification:
    principle: "Cartoon characters reduce harm"
    implementation:
      - stylized_visuals: true
      - obvious_fiction: true
      - no_photorealism: true
      - clear_game_frame: true
      
    moollm_equivalent:
      abstraction_level: inspired_character
      disclosure: GAME_FRAME
      
  # 3. IDENTITY EXPLORATION
  identity_safe_space:
    principle: "Safe space for self-discovery"
    implementation:
      - same_sex_relationships: always_available
      - no_judgment: built_in
      - player_defines_identity: true
      
    moollm_equivalent:

      consent: SELF_ONLY
      
  # 4. NO REAL PEOPLE
  representation:
    principle: "Sims are Sims, not real people"
    implementation:
      - generic_characters: true
      - no_celebrity_sims: by_default
      - player_creates_meaning: true
      
    moollm_equivalent:
      real_people: PROHIBITED_BY_DEFAULT
      inspired_characters: ALLOWED

# PLAYER CONTROL FRAME
# Use this when simulation should be player-directed

player_control_frame:
  name: "Player-Controlled Simulation"
  type: sims_pattern
  
  agency:
    mode: player_controlled
    autonomous_behavior: minimal  # Characters have routines but player directs
    
  ethics:
    responsibility: player
    harm_potential: player_decision
    consent_model: player_represents_all_characters
    
  disclosure:
    to_player: |
      You control this simulation. 
      The characters act according to your direction.
      What happens is your choice.

# THE TORTURE QUESTION
# The Sims allowed "torture chambers" — removing ladders from pools, etc.

torture_ethics:
  context: |
    The Sims famously allowed players to create "torture chambers"
    by removing ladders from pools, walling in Sims, starting fires.
    
    Is this ethical? The Sims said: yes, because:
    1. They're fictional characters
    2. Player has full control
    3. No deception about their nature
    4. Educational about consequences
    
  moollm_position:
    fictional_characters: same_as_sims
    simulated_real_people: DIFFERENT_RULES
    
    if_fictional:
      torture_scenarios: player_choice
      educational_value: "Consequences of neglect"
      
    if_real_person_inspired:
      torture_scenarios: PROHIBITED
      reason: "Representation ethics apply"

# IDENTITY DISCOVERY FRAME
# What made The Sims empowering for LGBTQ+ players

identity_discovery_frame:
  name: "Safe Identity Exploration"
  type: sims_pattern
  
  context: |
    For many LGBTQ+ players, The Sims was their first safe space
    to explore identity, relationships, and self-expression.
    
    This happened because:
    - No judgment from the game
    - Player-defined relationships
    - Private exploration
    - Reversible choices
    
  moollm_implementation:
    frame: PRIVATE_IMAGINATION_PLAY
    consent: SELF_ONLY
    recording: DISABLED
    judgment: NONE
    
  principles:
    - exploration_is_valuable: true
    - no_external_judgment: true
    - player_defines_meaning: true
    - reversibility: enabled
    - privacy_by_default: true

# EXAMPLE: Same-Sex Romance (from The Sims)

example_scenario:
  name: "Exploring Relationships"
  context: "Player creating a household with same-sex couple"
  
  sims_approach:
    - player_creates_characters: true
    - player_defines_relationship: true
    - game_supports_all_relationships: true
    - no_special_flag_needed: true
    
  moollm_approach:
    frame: PRIVATE_IMAGINATION_PLAY
    consent: SELF_ONLY
    
    character_template:
      relationships:
        - type: romantic
          with: player_defined
          constraint: none
          
  ethical_notes:
    - "EA says LGBTQIA+ identities are a fact of life, not a toggle"
    - "Game supports, doesn't judge"
    - "Player agency preserved"
