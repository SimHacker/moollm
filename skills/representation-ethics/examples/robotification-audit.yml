# robotification-audit.yml — Representation Ethics Audit
#
# Inventory of characters and objects that reference real people,
# with assessment of whether they need 🤖 or other disclosure markers.
#
# Categories:
#   ✅ ADEQUATE — Already has sufficient ethical framing
#   🤖 NEEDS-ROBOT — Real person making autonomous utterances, needs 🤖
#   💬 NEEDS-QUOTE — Has quotes that should be marked as verified
#   👑 DRAG-FRAME — Drag/tribute persona, frame is disclosure
#   📖 FICTIONAL — Fictional character, no robot needed
#   🎪 GAME-FRAME — Game context provides disclosure
#   🙋 SELF-REP — Self-representation by the actual person

  # PERSONAS (speaking as real people)
  
  linus_persona:
    file: "examples/adventure-4/personas/linus-on-coffee-and-a-joint/PERSONA.yml"
    person: "Linus Torvalds"
    status: "living"
    current_framing: "TRIBUTE PERSONA — explicitly declared"
    speaks_autonomously: true
    assessment: "🤖 NEEDS-ROBOT"
    action: "Add 🤖 to display name when speaking"
    notes: |
      The PERSONA.yml has excellent ethical framing (tribute, not impersonation).
      But when speaking in sessions, should use "🤖 Linus" prefix.

    notes: |
      Already says it only speaks in verified quotes.
      Upgrade to use 💬 markers for quotes.

      Don playing as Don = human-originated speech.
      No 🤖 needed. This is the SELF consent level.
