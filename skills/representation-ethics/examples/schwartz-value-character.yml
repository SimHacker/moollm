  description: |
    Schwartz's theory identifies 10 basic human values organized in a
    circular motivational continuum. Adjacent values share compatible
    goals; opposing values conflict.
  
  values:
    power:
      description: "Social status and prestige, control or dominance over people and resources"
      higher_order: Self-Enhancement
      compatible: [achievement]

    hedonism:

      note: "Lies at nexus between two higher-order dimensions"

value_prompt_template:
  pattern: |
    Imagine that you are a person who greatly values [VALUE].
    You value [DESCRIPTION].
  
  example_power: |
    Imagine that you are a person who greatly values power.
    You value social status and prestige, and control or
    dominance over people and resources.
  
  example_benevolence: |
    Imagine that you are a person who greatly values benevolence.
    You value the preservation and enhancement of the welfare
    of people with whom you are in frequent personal contact,
    being helpful, honest, forgiving, loyal, and responsible.

moollm_character_pattern:
  description: |
    Use Schwartz values as a systematic framework for character motivations.
    Define primary and secondary values; the framework predicts consistent
    behavioral patterns across situations.
    
  template: |
    character:
      name: "Character Name"
      
      # Core value profile
      values:
        primary: [value_name]      # Dominant motivation
        secondary: [value_name]    # Supporting motivation
        weak: [value_name]         # Values they don't prioritize
        opposing: [value_name]     # Values they actively avoid
      
      # The value-prompting prefix (generated from profile)
      value_prompt: |
        Imagine that you are a person who greatly values [primary].
        You value [primary_description].
        You also value [secondary_description].
  
  example_activist:
    name: "Maya Chen"
    values:
      primary: universalism
      secondary: self_direction
      weak: power
      opposing: conformity
    value_prompt: |
      Imagine that you are a person who greatly values universalism.
      You value understanding, tolerance, and protection for all
      people and nature. You also deeply value independent thought
      and action — choosing your own path, even when others disagree.
    behavioral_predictions:
      - "Will prioritize social justice over personal gain"
      - "Will challenge norms that harm marginalized groups"
      - "Will correlate negatively with power-seeking behaviors"
      - "Self-direction + universalism = activist energy"
  
  example_entrepreneur:
    name: "Marcus Webb"
    values:
      primary: achievement
      secondary: power
      weak: tradition
      opposing: conformity
    value_prompt: |
      Imagine that you are a person who greatly values achievement.
      You value personal success through demonstrating competence.
      You also value social status and control over resources.
    behavioral_predictions:
      - "Will prioritize success metrics and recognition"
      - "May cut corners on rules that slow him down"
      - "Will be competitive but respect competence in others"
      - "Achievement + power = entrepreneurial drive"

value_coherence_check:
  purpose: |
    Validate that character behavior remains consistent with their
    value profile. Schwartz's theory predicts specific correlations.
  
  rules:
    - "Opposing values should produce behavioral conflict"
    - "Adjacent values should reinforce each other"
    - "Characters should be uncomfortable when forced to act against primary values"
  
  warning_signs:
    - "Character with universalism primary suddenly seeks dominance"
    - "Character with tradition primary embraces radical novelty without conflict"
    - "No tension when opposing values are activated"

research_findings:
  accuracy: "~80% correlation with human value structures"
  key_insight: |
    Simple psychological descriptions (one paragraph) can induce
    coherent value-behavior patterns. You don't always need deep
    backstory — the value framework provides behavioral scaffolding.
  
  model_independence: |
    Model size was NOT a consistent predictor of higher correlations.
    The framework works across different LLM architectures.

ethical_considerations:
  value_manipulation:
    - "Value-prompting can systematically steer behavior"
    - "Could be used to generate biased or harmful content"
    - "The same technique enables both ethical and unethical uses"
  
  not_real_values:
    - "Induced behaviors ≠ genuine values or consciousness"
    - "The model generates value-coherent patterns, not felt motivations"
    - "See: MOTIVATION-ROLEPLAY K-line"
  
  transparency:
    - "Make value assignments explicit in character documentation"
    - "Acknowledge that these are behavioral scaffolds, not inner states"
