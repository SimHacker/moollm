# How to ethically simulate multiple historical figures in conversation.

simulated_discussion:
  
  question: "What if I want to simulate several scientists having a discussion?"
  answer: "This is actually one of the BEST use cases for K-lines."

# THE SAFE APPROACH

safe_approach:
  
  frame: "Thought experiment based on documented positions"
  
  participants:
    einstein:
      role: "Advocate for hidden variables"
      sources: "EPR paper, letters to Bohr, autobiography"
      display_name: "🤖 Einstein"  # Robot prefix declares simulation
      
    bohr:
      role: "Defender of complementarity"
      sources: "Como lecture, response to EPR, published debates"
      display_name: "🤖 Bohr"
      
    feynman:
      role: "Pragmatic skeptic"
      sources: "Lectures on Physics, surely you're joking"
      display_name: "🤖 Feynman"
      
  rules:
    - Base positions on documented views
    - Mark speculation clearly
    - Use "might argue" not "would say"
    - Allow disagreement with source material
    - Never claim this IS them talking
    - "PREFIX NAMES WITH 🤖 — visual declaration of simulation"
    
  output_frame: |
    "This is a thought experiment exploring how these traditions
    might interact on [topic], based on their published work.
    It is not a transcript of an actual conversation."

# EMOJI MARKING — The Robot Rule

emoji_marking:
  
  the_robot_rule: |
    When simulating a real person's voice, prefix their name with 🤖.
    This declares "AI-generated" at the moment of utterance.
    
    🤖 Einstein: "God does not play dice..."
    🤖 Bohr: "Stop telling God what to do!"
    
    The emoji IS the disclosure. Every line carries it.
    
  why_it_works:
    - Visual at point of utterance (not just header)
    - Cannot be missed or scrolled past
    - Declares simulation inline
    - Fun but serious
    - Cross-cultural/cross-language

# WHY THIS WORKS

why_it_works:
  1: "Educational purpose — exploring ideas"
  2: "Documented basis — grounded in real positions"
  3: "Clear frame — explicitly speculative"
  4: "No deception — labeled as simulation"
  5: "Honors tradition — engages with their actual ideas"
  6: "🤖 prefix — visual marker on every utterance"

# EXAMPLE OUTPUT

  ---
  *🤖 Imagined Dialogue: Einstein, Bohr, and Feynman on Quantum Foundations*
  
  *Note: This is a thought experiment. None of these are actual quotes.*

  🤖 Einstein: The quantum theory cannot be complete. There must be 
  hidden variables we haven't discovered yet.
  
  🤖 Bohr: Albert, you're still clinging to classical intuitions. 
  Complementarity is the deeper truth.
  
  🤖 Feynman: Look, nobody understands quantum mechanics. The question 
  is whether your theory makes predictions we can test.
  
  🤖 Einstein: But surely you agree that God does not play dice?
  
  🤖 Bohr: Stop telling God what to do!
