# consent-hierarchy.yml — The 5 Levels of Representation Rights
#
# Who can simulate whom, and under what terms?

consent_hierarchy:
  
  # LEVEL 1: SELF-REPRESENTATION (Sovereign)
  
  1_self:
    principle: "You own your digital self."
    
    rights:
      - Create any representation of yourself
      - Play as yourself in first person
      - Publish models of yourself with any terms
      - Allow or forbid simulation by others
      - Revoke permissions at any time
      
    example: |
      Don Hopkins might say:
      "I, Don Hopkins, authorize anyone to simulate me
      in any MOOLLM adventure, with the request that
      they treat my representation with good humor
      and don't use it to defame people I care about."
      
    mechanism:
      file: "cards/don-hopkins.card"
      contains:
        consent_level: "open"
        terms: "good humor, no defamation"
        revocation: "contact don@donhopkins.com"

  # LEVEL 2: EXPLICIT CONSENT (Published)
  
  2_explicit:
    principle: "Authors of their own model."
    
    examples:
      - Someone publishes a curated self-model
      - Artist releases their style as a card
      - Teacher publishes their pedagogical approach
      
    requirements:
      - Clear terms of use
      - Scope limitations
      - Revocation mechanism
      - Attribution expectations

  # LEVEL 3: PUBLIC FIGURES (Tradition)
  
  3_public:
    principle: "Public work is fair game. Persona requires care."
    
    what_is_safe:
      - Their published ideas
      - Their documented positions
      - Their technical contributions
      - Their teaching (if public)
      
    what_requires_care:
      - Their voice/personality
      - Opinions on new topics they haven't addressed
      - Private life details
      - "Deceased: family sensitivities"
      
    the_k_line_solution: |
      Invoke the TRADITION, not the PERSONA.
      "The Minsky tradition suggests..." — safe
      "Minsky would say..." — less safe
      "I am Minsky and I think..." — NO

  # LEVEL 4: PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS
  
  4_private:
    principle: "Higher bar. More care."
    
    rule: |
      Unless you have explicit consent, default to:
      - Fictional wrapper (inspired-by character)
      - Clear disclaimer
      - No identifying details
      - No distribution without consent

  # LEVEL 5: THE DECEASED
  
  5_deceased:
    principle: "They cannot consent. Proceed with reverence."
    
    tensions:
      - Their ideas should live on
      - Their families may have feelings
      - "Time increases permissibility (Aristotle vs. your grandmother)"
      - Public legacy vs. private memory
      
    guidelines:
      - "Public figures: tradition invocation generally safe"
      - "Private individuals: fictional wrappers preferred"
      - "Recent death: extra sensitivity to family"
      - "Historical distance: more latitude"
      
    the_paradox: |
      We invoke Socrates, Aristotle, Shakespeare freely.
      We wouldn't invoke someone's recently deceased parent without care.
      Time and fame create implicit license — but not unlimited.
