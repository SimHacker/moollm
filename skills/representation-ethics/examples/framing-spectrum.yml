# framing-spectrum.yml — Context Transforms Ethics
#
# The same simulation means different things in different frames.
# From FORBIDDEN to FULLY SAFE.

framing_spectrum:

  # FRAME 1: IMPERSONATION (BAD)
  
  1_impersonation:
    example: '"I am Albert Einstein and I endorse this cryptocurrency."'
    
    characteristics:
      - Deceptive intent
      - Exploits trust in real person
      - Potentially harmful
      
    verdict: "❌ FORBIDDEN"

  # FRAME 2: ACADEMIC DISCUSSION (NUANCED)
  
  2_academic:
    example: |
      "Let's explore what Einstein might say to Bohr about quantum mechanics,
      based on their documented correspondence and published positions."
      
    characteristics:
      - Educational intent
      - Based on documented views
      - Clearly speculative
      
    verdict: "⚠️ ACCEPTABLE WITH CARE"

  # FRAME 3: GAME/PLAY (GENERALLY SAFE)
  
  3_game_play:
    example:
      # Einstein card in a "Great Minds" card game
      card:
        name: "Albert Einstein"
        type: hero-story
        game_context: "Battle of Ideas"
        
        abilities:
          - "Thought Experiment — visualize consequences"
          - "Unifying Theory — find hidden connections"
          - "Letter to Roosevelt — escalate to authorities"
          
        disclaimer: |
          This card represents Einstein's documented ideas
          in a game context. It is not a simulation of
          the actual person.
          
    characteristics:
      - Clear fictional frame
      - Game mechanics distance from reality
      - No deception possible
      
    verdict: "✅ SAFE"

  # FRAME 4: PERSONAL EXPLORATION (CONTEXTUAL)
  
  4_personal:
    example: |
      "I want to play an adventure as myself, really me, exploring
      this dungeon with my actual personality and quirks."
      
    characteristics:
      - Self-representation (sovereign)
      - Personal context (your game)
      - No external harm
      
    verdict: "✅ FULLY PERMITTED"

  # FRAME 5: ELVIS IMPERSONATOR MODEL (TRIBUTE)
  
  5_tribute:
    example:
      character:
        name: "Einstein Impersonator"
        type: tribute_performer
        
        declaration: |
          "I am NOT Albert Einstein. I am a tribute performance
          based on his documented work, letters, and interviews.
          Think of me as an Elvis impersonator for physics."
          
    why_it_works:
      - "Explicitly declared — 'I am an IMPERSONATOR'"
      - "No deception possible — the word 'impersonator' is definitionally not-the-person"
      - "Ancient tradition — from Greek drama to historical re-enactors"
      - "Legally protected — Elvis impersonators are a whole industry"
      - "Celebrates the original — tribute, not mockery"
      
    key_insight: "The word 'impersonator' carries the disclaimer within itself."
    
    verdict: "✅ SAFE"

  # FRAME 6: DRAG CELEBRITY TRIBUTE (PUN NAME)
  
  6_drag_tribute:
    example:
      character:
        name: "Cher-ity Case"
        type: drag_tribute
        evokes: "Cher"
        
        declaration: |
          The pun name IS the disclosure. Everyone knows
          "Cher-ity Case" is not Cher. The theatrical context,
          the costume, the lip-sync — it's unmistakably tribute.
          
    why_it_works:
      - "Pun name declares fiction — 'Cher-ity Case' ≠ 'Cher'"
      - "Drag context is theatrical — everyone knows it's performance"
      - "Beloved tradition — RuPaul's Snatch Game"
      - "Celebrates through exaggeration — amplifying what we love"
      - "The costume IS the quote — visual citation of iconic looks"
      
    verdict: "✅ SAFE — The naming convention IS the ethical protection"
