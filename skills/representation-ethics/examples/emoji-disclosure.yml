# emoji-disclosure.yml — Visual Markers for Representation Ethics
#
# Emojis as inline disclosure. The mark IS the framing.

# THE ROBOT RULE — Simulated Speech

robot_rule:
  
  emoji: 🤖
  use_when: "Simulating a real person's voice/words"
  
  principle: |
    Prefix names with 🤖 when generating simulated speech.
    Every utterance carries its own disclosure.
    
  examples:
    chat_names:
      - "🤖 Einstein"
      - "🤖 Feynman"
      - "🤖 Ada Lovelace"
      
    inline_dialogue:
      - '🤖 Einstein: "God does not play dice..."'
      - '🤖 Bohr: "Stop telling God what to do!"'
      
  why_it_works:
    - Visual at point of utterance
    - Cannot be scrolled past or missed
    - Cross-cultural, cross-language
    - Fun but serious
    - Inline disclosure, not just header

# WHEN YOU DON'T NEED 🤖 — Frame Provides Disclosure

frame_indemnification:
  
  principle: |
    When the CHARACTER FRAME already declares fiction/performance,
    you don't need 🤖 on every utterance. The frame IS the disclosure.
    
  the_donna_example: |
    Donna is a drag king character inspired by Trump.
    
    She is NOT "🤖 Trump" because:
    1. "Donna" ≠ "Donald Trump" (different name)
    2. Drag king context is inherently theatrical
    3. Fictional character in a story/game
    4. Everyone knows it's performance
    
    So Donna's lines are:
      👑 Donna: Make America fabulous again!
    
    NOT:
      🤖 Trump: Make America great again!
    
    The drag frame provides the ethical protection.
    
  when_robot_required:
    - "Simulating actual person with their real name"
    - "No other frame declares performance/fiction"
    - "Could be mistaken for actual person's views"
    - "Educational 'what would X say' without fiction wrapper"
    
  when_frame_suffices:
    - "👑 Drag persona (Donna, Cher-ity Case)"
    - "🎭 Actor playing role (Cate Blanchett as Dylan)"
    - "🃏 Satirical character (SNL cold open)"
    - "📖 Fictional character (inspired-by, renamed)"
    - "🎪 Game/play character (hero-story card)"
    
  hierarchy: |
    MOST PROTECTED ←─────────────────────────────→ NEEDS 🤖 MARKUP
    
    Fictional    Drag      Satire    Actor    "What if"    Direct
    character    persona   character  role     speculation  simulation

# THE PRINCIPLE

principle: |
  The emoji IS the disclosure. 
  
  Don't rely on header disclaimers alone.
  Mark each utterance at point of generation.
  
  🤖 Einstein says something → reader KNOWS it's simulated.
  💬 Einstein says something → reader KNOWS it's a verified quote.
  ⚠️ Einstein says something → reader KNOWS it's uncertain.
  
  No ambiguity. No scrolling past the warning.
  The mark travels with the content.

# VERIFICATION PRINCIPLE — Trust but Mark

verification_principle: |
  VERIFIED markers (💬 ✓ 🔗 📎 👤) mean YOU CHECKED.
  
  Don't slap ✓ on something you didn't verify.
  Don't use 🔗 on a link you didn't test.
  Don't use 💬 on a quote you didn't source.
  
  If uncertain, use ⚠️ or ❓ instead.
  Honest uncertainty > false confidence.

verification_levels:
  
  💬_verified_quote:
    meaning: "I found the original source"
    requires: "Citation to primary source"
    example: '💬 "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself." (FDR, 1933 inaugural)'
    
  ✓_verified_fact:
    meaning: "I confirmed this is accurate"
    requires: "Cross-reference or primary source"
    example: "✓ Einstein received Nobel Prize in 1921 (for photoelectric effect, not relativity)"
    
  🔗_verified_link:
    meaning: "I tested this URL"
    requires: "Actually clicking the link"
    example: "🔗 https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/einstein-philscience/"
    
  📎_verified_citation:
    meaning: "This reference exists"
    requires: "Looking up the source"
    example: "📎 Isaacson, W. (2007). Einstein: His Life and Universe. Simon & Schuster."
    
  👤_verified_bio:
    meaning: "These biographical facts are confirmed"
    requires: "Cross-reference with reliable sources"
    example: "👤 Marie Curie (1867-1934), physicist/chemist, 2x Nobel laureate"
    
  ⚠️_unverified:
    meaning: "I haven't confirmed this"
    requires: "Honesty about uncertainty"
    example: "⚠️ Einstein allegedly said this but I couldn't find the source"
    
  ❓_disputed:
    meaning: "This is commonly misattributed"
    requires: "Knowledge that attribution is questionable"
    example: '❓ "Be the change you wish to see" (often attributed to Gandhi, likely paraphrase)'

# COMBINING WITH OTHER MARKERS

combinations:
  
  educational_simulation:
    format: "🎓🤖 Name"
    meaning: "Educational context, simulated voice"
    example: "🎓🤖 Socrates: Let us examine this question..."
