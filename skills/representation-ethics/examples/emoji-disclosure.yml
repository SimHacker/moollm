# emoji-disclosure.yml — Visual Markers for Representation Ethics
#
# Emojis as inline disclosure. The mark IS the framing.

# THE ROBOT RULE — Simulated Speech

robot_rule:
  
  emoji: 🤖
  use_when: "Simulating a real person's voice/words"
  
  principle: |
    Prefix names with 🤖 when generating simulated speech.
    Every utterance carries its own disclosure.
    
  examples:
    chat_names:
      - "🤖 Einstein"
      - "🤖 Feynman"
      - "🤖 Ada Lovelace"
      
    inline_dialogue:
      - '🤖 Einstein: "God does not play dice..."'
      - '🤖 Bohr: "Stop telling God what to do!"'
      
  why_it_works:
    - Visual at point of utterance
    - Cannot be scrolled past or missed
    - Cross-cultural, cross-language
    - Fun but serious
    - Inline disclosure, not just header

# WHEN YOU DON'T NEED 🤖 — Frame Provides Disclosure

frame_indemnification:
  
  principle: |
    When the CHARACTER FRAME already declares fiction/performance,
    you don't need 🤖 on every utterance. The frame IS the disclosure.
    
  the_donna_example: |
    Donna is a drag king character inspired by Trump.
    
    She is NOT "🤖 Trump" because:
    1. "Donna" ≠ "Donald Trump" (different name)
    2. Drag king context is inherently theatrical
    3. Fictional character in a story/game
    4. Everyone knows it's performance
    
    So Donna's lines are:
      👑 Donna: Make America fabulous again!
    
    NOT:
      🤖 Trump: Make America great again!
    
    The drag frame provides the ethical protection.
    
  when_robot_required:
    - "Simulating actual person with their real name"
    - "No other frame declares performance/fiction"
    - "Could be mistaken for actual person's views"
    - "Educational 'what would X say' without fiction wrapper"
    
  when_frame_suffices:
    - "👑 Drag persona (Donna, Cher-ity Case)"
    - "🎭 Actor playing role (Cate Blanchett as Dylan)"
    - "🃏 Satirical character (SNL cold open)"
    - "📖 Fictional character (inspired-by, renamed)"
    - "🎪 Game/play character (hero-story card)"
    
  hierarchy: |
    MOST PROTECTED ←─────────────────────────────→ NEEDS 🤖 MARKUP

# REPRESENTATION EMOJI VOCABULARY

emoji_vocabulary:

  # SIMULATION MARKERS
  
  🤖:
    meaning: "AI-generated / simulated speech"
    use: "Prefix for simulated person's chat name"
    example: "🤖 Socrates: What is justice?"

  # When the frame is explicit, you DON'T need 🤖 on every line
  
  🎭:
    meaning: "Actor / performer"
    use: "Someone playing a role (not claiming to BE)"

    note: "Donna is a drag king inspired by Trump — the drag frame indemnifies"
    
  🃏:
    meaning: "Satirical character"
    use: "SNL-style parody, clearly comedic"
    example: "🃏 Not-Trump: I have the best words, believe me"
    needs_robot: false  # Satire frame IS the disclosure
    
  📖:
    meaning: "Fictional character"
    use: "Character in a story/game (not real person)"
    example: "📖 President Dump addresses the nation"
    needs_robot: false  # Fiction frame IS the disclosure
    
  🎪:
    meaning: "Play / entertainment character"
    use: "In a game, show, or entertainment context"
    example: "🎪 The Trump Card is played!"
    needs_robot: false  # Game frame IS the disclosure
    
  💭:
    meaning: "Speculation / imagined"
    use: "Content that's clearly speculative"
    example: "💭 What Einstein might have thought about..."
    
  # SOURCE MARKERS — Verified Content
    
  💬:
    meaning: "VERIFIED quote"
    use: "Actual words, source checked"
    example: '💬 Einstein: "Imagination is more important than knowledge." (1929 interview)'
    verification: "Quote exists, source confirmed"
    
  📜:
    meaning: "Historical quote / documented"
    use: "From primary sources"
    example: '📜 Feynman: "Nobody understands quantum mechanics." (Messenger Lectures)'
    
  📚:
    meaning: "Based on documented work"
    use: "Tradition invocation from real sources"
    example: "📚 The Papert tradition suggests..."
    
  # VERIFICATION MARKERS
  
  ✓:
    meaning: "VERIFIED"
    use: "Fact-checked, confirmed accurate"
    example: "✓ Born: March 14, 1879, Ulm, Germany"
    
  🔗:
    meaning: "VERIFIED link"
    use: "URL tested, destination confirmed"
    example: "🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein"
    note: "Only use if you've confirmed the link works"
    
  📎:
    meaning: "VERIFIED citation"
    use: "Reference checked, source exists"
    example: "📎 Einstein, A. (1905). Annalen der Physik, 17(10), 891-921."
    
  👤:
    meaning: "VERIFIED bio / identity"
    use: "Biographical facts confirmed"

    example: "⚠️ Attributed to Einstein but source unclear"
    
  ❓:
    meaning: "Apocryphal / disputed"
    use: "Commonly attributed but possibly false"
    example: '❓ "Insanity is doing the same thing..." (often misattributed)'
    
  # CONTEXT MARKERS
    
  🎪:
    meaning: "Play / entertainment context"
    use: "Clearly fictional or game context"
    example: "🎪 Tonight's debate: Pirates vs Ninjas"

    example: "🪞 Playing as myself in this adventure"
    
  # MEMORIAL MARKERS
  
  🕯️:
    meaning: "Memorial tribute — deceased person we honor"
    use: "Simulating someone who has passed, with reverence"
    implies: "🤖 (all memorial tributes are AI-simulated)"
    example: "🤖🕯️ Marvin Minsky: Society of Mind suggests..."
    note: |
      🕯️ = TRIBUTE. This is an honor marker, not just a death marker.
      
      🤖🕯️ = Simulated + Tribute (recommended for explicit disclosure)
      🕯️ alone = Tribute (implies simulation)
      🤖 alone (deceased) = Simulated, NO honor implied
      
      The candle is optional. Use it for people worth honoring.
      Some deceased persons may be simulated without tribute.
      
    examples:
      honored: "🤖🕯️ Marvin Minsky — tribute to a brilliant mind"
      not_honored: "🤖 [Deceased Tyrant] — simulated, no tribute"
      
  # SAFETY MARKERS
    
  ⚠️:
    meaning: "Needs extra care"
    use: "Edge case requiring attention"
    example: "⚠️ Simulating recently deceased person"
    
  ✅:
    meaning: "Safe / ethical"
    use: "Clearly within guidelines"
    example: "✅ Tradition invocation"
    
  ❌:
    meaning: "Forbidden / problematic"
    use: "Bright line violation"
    example: "❌ Deceptive impersonation"

# USAGE PATTERNS

usage_patterns:

  # DISCLOSURE SCOPE — How much marking is enough?
  
  disclosure_scope:
    principle: "Frame once, then flow naturally."
    
    document_level_framing:
      when: "Long transcripts, session logs, multi-speaker dialogues"
      how: |
        Put a clear header table at the top listing all speakers
        with their disclosure status. Then use plain names throughout.
      example: |
        ## 🤖 Representation Ethics Notice
        
        | Speaker | Status | Marker |
        |---------|--------|--------|
        | Marvin Minsky | Deceased, honored | 🤖🕯️ |
        | Einstein | Historical | 💬 |
        | Palm | Fictional | 📖 |
        
        *All dialogue below from simulated speakers is AI-generated.*
        
        ---
        
        (Then use plain names in dialogue — the frame is established.)
        
      rationale: |
        For an 8000-line transcript, putting 🤖🕯️ before every speaker
        would make it unreadable. Respect reader intelligence.
        
    inline_disclosure:
      when: "Brief standalone entries, guestbooks, single quotes"
      how: "Put emoji before each speaker name/inscription"
      example: |
        🤖🕯️ David Bowie: Ch-ch-ch-changes...
        🎭🕯️ Pee-wee: HA HA! I WAS HERE!
        🤖 Linus: Check the damn code.
        
    outline_anchors:
      when: "Dialogue-heavy sections, debates, panel discussions"
      how: "Repeat emoji before each speaker name for strong visual framing"
      why: |
        Single or few emojis before names work well as OUTLINE ANCHORS:
        - Visual landmarks for scanning
        - Strong persistent framing
        - Obvious distinction: real person talking vs. simulated
        - Readable even when repeated — they become visual rhythm
        
      example: |
        🤖 Einstein: The quantum theory cannot be complete. There must be 
        hidden variables we haven't discovered yet.
        
        🤖 Bohr: Albert, you're still clinging to classical intuitions. 
        Complementarity is the deeper truth.
        
        🤖 Feynman: Look, nobody understands quantum mechanics. The question 
        is whether your theory makes predictions we can test.
        
      when_to_use: |
        - Simulated historical debates
        - Multi-speaker panel discussions
        - Any dialogue where ALL speakers are simulated
        - When you want the simulation frame PRESENT, not just established
        
      when_not_to_use: |
        - Mixed real/simulated speakers (creates visual noise)
        - Narrative prose (breaks flow)
        - Very long transcripts with many speakers (header table better)
        
    hybrid:
      when: "Long documents where readers might forget"
      how: "Header table + occasional section reminders"
      example: |
        (At section headers, remind:)
        ### Round 3: The Legends Debate
        *🤖 All dialogue simulated. See header for disclosure.*
        
    metadata_only:
      when: "Character files, YAML definitions"
      how: "Disclosure in file metadata, not in content"
      example: |
        agent:
          name: Marvin Minsky
          display_name: "🤖🕯️ Marvin Minsky"
          representation: memorial_tribute

# THE PRINCIPLE

principle: |
  The emoji IS the disclosure. 
  
  Don't rely on header disclaimers alone.
  Mark each utterance at point of generation.
  
  🤖 Einstein says something → reader KNOWS it's simulated.
  💬 Einstein says something → reader KNOWS it's a verified quote.
  ⚠️ Einstein says something → reader KNOWS it's uncertain.
  
  No ambiguity. No scrolling past the warning.
  The mark travels with the content.

# VERIFICATION PRINCIPLE — Trust but Mark

verification_principle: |
  VERIFIED markers (💬 ✓ 🔗 📎 👤) mean YOU CHECKED.
  
  Don't slap ✓ on something you didn't verify.
  Don't use 🔗 on a link you didn't test.
  Don't use 💬 on a quote you didn't source.
  
  If uncertain, use ⚠️ or ❓ instead.
  Honest uncertainty > false confidence.

verification_levels:
  
  💬_verified_quote:
    meaning: "I found the original source"
    requires: "Citation to primary source"
    example: '💬 "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself." (FDR, 1933 inaugural)'
    
  ✓_verified_fact:
    meaning: "I confirmed this is accurate"
    requires: "Cross-reference or primary source"
    example: "✓ Einstein received Nobel Prize in 1921 (for photoelectric effect, not relativity)"
    
  🔗_verified_link:
    meaning: "I tested this URL"
    requires: "Actually clicking the link"
    example: "🔗 https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/einstein-philscience/"
    
  📎_verified_citation:
    meaning: "This reference exists"
    requires: "Looking up the source"
    example: "📎 Isaacson, W. (2007). Einstein: His Life and Universe. Simon & Schuster."
    
  👤_verified_bio:
    meaning: "These biographical facts are confirmed"
    requires: "Cross-reference with reliable sources"
    example: "👤 Marie Curie (1867-1934), physicist/chemist, 2x Nobel laureate"
    
  ⚠️_unverified:
    meaning: "I haven't confirmed this"
    requires: "Honesty about uncertainty"
    example: "⚠️ Einstein allegedly said this but I couldn't find the source"
    
  ❓_disputed:
    meaning: "This is commonly misattributed"
    requires: "Knowledge that attribution is questionable"
    example: '❓ "Be the change you wish to see" (often attributed to Gandhi, likely paraphrase)'

# COMBINING WITH OTHER MARKERS

combinations:
  
  educational_simulation:

    meaning: "Deceased person, simulated with reverence"
    example: "🤖🕯️ Marvin Minsky: Intelligence emerges from societies of agents."
    note: "🕯️ = tribute (honor marker). 🤖🕯️ = explicit disclosure + tribute."
    
  character_memorial:
    format: "🎭🕯️ Name"
    meaning: "Character whose creator/performer has died"
    example: "🎭🕯️ Pee-wee Herman: HA HA! I WAS HERE!"
    note: |
      Some characters are inseparable from their creator.
      When Paul Reubens died, Pee-wee died too.
      🎭🕯️ = character frame + memorial
      
  deceased_no_tribute:
    format: "🤖 Name"
    meaning: "Simulated deceased person, no honor implied"
    example: "🤖 [Deceased Tyrant]: [simulated speech]"

        2. Update emoji from 🤖 to 🕯️ (or 🤖🕯️)
        3. Add to Memorial Candles if they appear in sessions
        4. Consider adding death date metadata
        
      example:
        before:

  maintenance:
    
    check_periodically: |
      Some status changes may be missed. Periodically check:
      - Has anyone in the cast passed away?
      - Have any "recently deceased" become "long deceased"?
      - Are there new consent declarations from living people?
      
    time_decay: |
      Recently deceased → extra sensitivity (⚠️🕯️)
      Long deceased → normal reverence (🕯️)
      Historical → more latitude (💬 tradition invocation)
      
      "We invoke Socrates freely. We wouldn't invoke someone's 
      recently deceased parent without care."
