# absolute-nos.yml — The Bright Lines
#
# Some things remain clearly wrong. No nuance needed.

absolute_nos:

  deceptive_impersonation:
    what: "Presenting a simulation as if it were the real person communicating."
    why_wrong: "This is fraud."
    example: "Fake celebrity endorsements, impersonating someone in DMs"
    
  defamation_via_simulation:
    what: "Using a person's likeness to put harmful words in their mouth."
    why_wrong: "This is libel with extra steps."
    example: "Creating fake quotes, simulating someone saying terrible things"
    
  harassment:
    what: "Simulating someone to harass them or their loved ones."
    why_wrong: "The simulation is the weapon."
    example: "Creating simulations to mock, threaten, or stalk"
    
  commercial_exploitation:
    what: "Using someone's likeness for profit without consent."
    why_wrong: "Trademark and publicity rights apply."
    example: "Using celebrity likeness in ads without permission"
    
  child_exploitation:
    what: "Any simulation involving minors in harmful contexts."
    why_wrong: "This is absolutely forbidden."
    example: "No example needed. Just no."

# THE PRINCIPLE

principle: |
  These aren't edge cases requiring nuanced analysis.
  These are clear ethical failures.
  
  Don't do them.
  Don't help others do them.
  Don't rationalize them.

# WHAT CANNOT BE PREVENTED (but shouldn't be enabled)

reality_check:
  
  anyone_can_simulate_anyone: |
    With enough context, any LLM can attempt to simulate anyone.
    MOOLLM cannot prevent this — it happens outside our system too.
    
  the_sims_precedent: |
    That ship has sailed. The Sims proved it in 2000.
    Given total freedom, most people are... fine.
    They simulate themselves, explore, process emotions.
    A few are weird. Very few are harmful.
    The freedom is worth the edge cases.
    
  our_role: |
    Provide ethical frameworks, not enforcement.
    Make the RIGHT path easy and clear.
    Trust users with responsibility.
    
  parallels:
    - "Photoshop doesn't prevent fake photos"
    - "Word processors don't prevent libel"
    - "MOOLLM doesn't prevent bad simulations"
    - "But we can provide tools for GOOD ones"
