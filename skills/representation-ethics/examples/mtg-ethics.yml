# mtg-ethics.yml — The Magic: The Gathering Model
#
# Card games provide a useful ethical framework for representation.

mtg_ethics:
  
  why_it_works:
    - Cards clearly aren't the people
    - It's a game, not a deception
    - Historical figures appear all the time
    - The FRAME makes intent clear
    
  application_to_moollm:
    - Hero-Story cards ARE this model
    - '"Playing a card" ≠ "being that person"'
    - Cards invoke traditions/abilities
    - The game context is explicit
    
  examples:
    - "I play the Dave Ungar card to invoke prototype thinking"
    - "I summon the Papert tradition to approach this pedagogically"
    - "My deck includes Engelbart for augmentation strategies"

# THE INSIGHT

insight: |
  Nobody thinks playing a Magic card makes you that creature.
  Nobody thinks playing a Hero-Story card makes you that person.
  
  The game frame IS the ethical protection.
  Cards invoke traditions. They don't claim identity.

# HERO-STORY PATTERN

hero_story_pattern:
  
  what_it_is: |
    A card representing a real person's documented contributions
    in a game/learning context.
    
  contains:
    - Their key ideas (documented)
    - Their abilities (based on real work)
    - Their K-lines (what traditions they activate)
    
  does_not_contain:
    - Simulated personality
    - Invented opinions
    - Claims to BE them
    
  example:
    card:
      name: "Seymour Papert"
      type: hero-story
      
      abilities:
        - "Constructionism — learning by making"
        - "Microworld — contained learning space"
        - "Powerful Ideas — concepts that unlock domains"
        
      k_lines:
        - CONSTRUCTIONISM
        - LEARNING-BY-DOING
        - CHILD-AS-BUILDER
        
      disclaimer: |
        This card represents Papert's documented educational philosophy.
        It is not a simulation of the person.
