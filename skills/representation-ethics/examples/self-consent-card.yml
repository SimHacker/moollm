# self-consent-card.yml — Self-Representation and Digital Sovereignty
#
# You own your digital self. Here's how to declare terms.

self_consent_card:
  
  creator: "you"
  subject: "you"
  
  # You define the terms
  consent_level:
    options:
      closed:   "Only I can simulate me"
      friends:  "Named individuals may simulate me"
      open:     "Anyone may simulate me"
      copyleft: "Simulate me freely, share alike"
      
  constraints:
    you_define:
      - What aspects are simulatable
      - What topics are off-limits
      - How to handle edge cases
      - Whether results can be published
      - Revocation terms
      
  philosophy: |
    Your digital representation is YOURS.
    You can share it, restrict it, or open-source it.
    This is digital sovereignty.
