# demographic stereotypes. Based on Park et al. 2024 findings:
# 85% normalized accuracy when grounded in 2-hour interviews.

meta:
  pattern: interview-grounded-character
  purpose: Deep character grounding through qualitative data
  reference: "Park et al. (2024) — Generative Agent Simulations of 1,000 People"
  key_insight: |
    Rich qualitative data captures IDIOSYNCRASIES that prevent stereotyping.
    Interviews outperform demographics, surveys, and self-written persona paragraphs.
    Even 20% of an interview beats full survey+experiment data.

why_interviews_work:
  idiosyncrasy_preservation:
    problem: "Demographics → stereotypes"
    solution: "Interviews → individual quirks"
    example: |
      Demographics: "50-year-old white male Republican"
      → LLM generates stereotypical conservative responses
      
      Interview includes: "I'm Republican but support marijuana legalization
        and abortion rights — grew up libertarian in New Hampshire, spent
        time outdoors as a kid, my mom was actually quite liberal..."
      → LLM generates nuanced, individual responses
  
  depth_vs_breadth:
    finding: "Even 20% of an interview outperforms full survey+experiment data"
    implication: "Invest in qualitative depth, not quantitative breadth"
  
  bias_reduction:
    mechanism: "Rich data reduces Demographic Parity Difference"
    stats:
      political_ideology_dpd:
        demographic_agents: "12.35%"
        interview_agents: "7.85%"
        improvement: "-4.5 points"
      racial_dpd:
        demographic_agents: "3.33%"
        interview_agents: "2.08%"
        improvement: "-1.25 points"

interview_protocol:
  duration: "~2 hours (avg 6,491 words)"
  structure: "Semi-structured with adaptive follow-up"
  
  topic_areas:
    life_story:
      example_question: |
        Tell me the story of your life. Start from the beginning — from your
        childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major
        life events you may have had.
      why_it_matters: "Life trajectory shapes decision-making"
    
    crossroads_moments:
      example_question: |
        Was there a moment where multiple paths were available, and your choice
        made a significant difference in defining who you are?
      why_it_matters: "Key decisions reveal values and agency patterns"
    
    current_context:
      topics: ["family", "neighborhood", "work", "health", "finances"]
      why_it_matters: "Present circumstances shape present responses"
    
    views_and_values:
      topics: ["political views", "social issues", "religion/spirituality"]
      why_it_matters: "Explicit values anchor moral reasoning"
    
    hopes_and_values:
      example_question: |
        Imagine yourself a few years from now. What do you hope for?
        What do you value the most in your life?
      why_it_matters: "Future orientation reveals motivations"

expert_reflection_module:
  purpose: "Synthesize interview from multiple domain perspectives"
  
  experts:
    psychologist:
      focus: "Personality, coping patterns, relationships"
      example_insight: |
        "Values independence strongly; expresses frustration with
        overprotectiveness. Suggests strong need for autonomy and
        self-determination."
    
    behavioral_economist:
      focus: "Risk preference, financial behavior, decision patterns"
      example_insight: |
        "Blends practical financial goals with leisure aspirations.
        Moderate risk tolerance with emphasis on work-life balance."
    
    political_scientist:
      focus: "Ideology, partisan identity, policy positions"
      example_insight: |
        "Identifies as Republican but holds cross-cutting positions
        on abortion and marijuana. Blend of ideologies rather than
        pure partisan alignment."
    
    demographer:
      focus: "Social position, life trajectory, context"
      example_insight: |
        "Works as inventory specialist with moderate income. Job
        stability but variable schedule. Contributes to household
        income as secondary earner."

moollm_character_template:
  description: |
    A MOOLLM character grounded in interview-style data rather than
    demographics or brief persona descriptions.
  
  example:
    name: "Alex"
    grounding_type: "interview"
    
    life_trajectory:
      childhood: |
        Grew up in a small town in rural New England. Spent a lot of time
        outdoors — hiking, fishing with grandpa. Parents divorced when I was 12.
        Lived with mom, visited dad summers. Made me self-reliant.
      
      education: |
        High school was academically mediocre but socially rich. Drama club
        became my thing. Went to state college, studied business because
        "practical" but minored in philosophy because I actually cared.
      
      career: |
        Started in retail management. Moved to inventory systems. Now I'm
        the person who makes sure the right stuff is in the right place.
        Not glamorous but I'm good at it and it leaves mental space for life.
    
    crossroads_moment: |
      At 28, had a job offer in Seattle — big tech company, double salary.
      Also had just started dating someone here. Chose to stay. No regrets.
      Money isn't everything. That relationship became my marriage.
    
    current_context:
      family: "Married 8 years. Two kids, 4 and 6. Close to extended family."
      neighborhood: "Suburban, diverse. Kids go to public school."
      finances: "Comfortable but not wealthy. Own home with mortgage."
      health: "Generally good. Some back issues from warehouse days."
    
    values_and_views:
      political: |
        Registered independent, lean pragmatic. Vote issues, not party.
        Fiscally careful, socially liberal. Hate extremism on both sides.
      
      religion: |
        Raised Catholic, now spiritual but not religious. Believe in
        something bigger but don't claim to know what. Meditation helps.
      
      core_values: ["family", "honesty", "self-reliance", "community"]
    
    hopes: |
      Want to see kids grow up well-adjusted. Want to retire somewhere
      with space — maybe back to New England. Want to feel like I
      contributed something, even if small.
    
    idiosyncrasies:
      - "Overthinks small purchases, underthinks big ones"
      - "Reads philosophy books but watches trashy reality TV to unwind"
      - "Hates being told what to do but follows rules when they make sense"
      - "Answers survey questions with caveats ('well, it depends...')"

evaluation_approach:
  normalized_accuracy:
    definition: "Agent accuracy ÷ Human self-consistency"
    interpretation: |
      Value of 0.85 means: agent predicts responses 85% as accurately
      as humans replicate their own responses two weeks later.
    
    why_it_matters: |
      Raw accuracy is misleading because humans themselves are inconsistent.
      Normalizing by self-consistency gives meaningful benchmark.
  
  comparison_not_matching:
    principle: |
      Don't try to MATCH human responses perfectly.
      Try to predict them as well as humans can predict themselves.

ethical_considerations:
  consent_required:
    - "Interview subject must consent to simulation creation"
    - "Clear explanation of how data will be used"
    - "Withdrawal rights for 25+ years"
  
  access_controls:
    - "Aggregated data: open access with usage agreement"
    - "Individual responses: restricted access with research proposal"
    - "Audit logs for all agent usage"
    - "Participant can see what their agent is doing"
  
  privacy_evolution:
    note: |
      As models become more powerful, privacy risks may increase.
      Commit to reassessing and notifying participants of capability changes.

comparison_with_alternatives:
  demographics_only:
    approach: "50-year-old white male Republican"
    normalized_accuracy: "0.71"
    problem: "Relies on stereotypes"
  
  self_written_persona:
    approach: "Paragraph participant writes about themselves"
    normalized_accuracy: "0.70"
    problem: "Too brief, misses depth"
  
  survey_experiment_data:
    approach: "All GSS, Big Five, economic game responses"
    normalized_accuracy: "0.76"
    problem: "Structured data misses idiosyncrasies"
  
  interview_based:
    approach: "2-hour qualitative interview"
    normalized_accuracy: "0.85"
    advantage: "Captures individual quirks"
