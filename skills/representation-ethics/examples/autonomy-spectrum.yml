# Autonomy Spectrum
# From player-controlled to fully autonomous agents

context: |
  Agent autonomy exists on a spectrum from fully player-controlled
  (like The Sims) to fully autonomous (like Smallville).
  
  Each level has different ethical implications.
  This document helps choose the right level.

  moollm_recommendation: |
    For most use cases, Level 3 (Checkpoint Autonomy) provides
    the best balance of emergence and safety.
    
    - Agents can surprise you
    - Humans catch problems at checkpoints
    - Responsibility is clear
    - Emergence is monitored
