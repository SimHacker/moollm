example:
  id: debate-moderation-lab
  frame: debate_moderation_lab
  purpose: "Simulate debate and moderation policy testing without producing abuse playbooks."

    requirements: ["evidence-first", "cite sources", "label speculation"]

  moderation_testing:
    scope: "Policy evaluation and fairness checks."
    constraints:
      - "No real targets or operational data."
      - "No evasion coaching or threshold disclosure."
      - "Aggregate-only results; no step-by-step bypass patterns."

  safety:
    trolls: "Simulated trolls allowed only for de-escalation practice."
    outputs: "Focus on detection and response, not amplification."
