    The ethics of simulating people: dignity, consent, context.
    How to reference real people's wisdom without puppeteering.
    
    The ship has sailed. People simulate each other. 
    The question is how to do it well.

# THE CORE FRAMEWORK — These principles stay in the card

# THE KEY DISTINCTION

key_distinction:
  DECEPTIVE_IMPERSONATION: |
    "I am Richard Feynman and I think..."
    → FORBIDDEN. Claiming to BE the person.
    
  TRADITION_ACTIVATION: |
    "Applying Feynman's curiosity tradition..."
    → SAFE. Invoking ideas, not persona.
    
  PERFORMANCE_IMPERSONATION: |
    "Tonight, playing Feynman..." (clearly framed)
    → SAFE. The framing declares fiction.

# THE CONSENT HIERARCHY

consent_hierarchy:
  1_self:        "You own your digital self. Full freedom."
  2_explicit:    "Published consent with terms. Honor terms."
  3_public:      "Public figures: public words only. K-line, not persona."
  4_private:     "Private people: explicit consent or fictional wrapper."
  5_deceased:    "Cannot consent. Invoke tradition with reverence."

# THE SIMS PRECEDENT

sims_precedent: |
  The Sims showed you can simulate people without harm when:
  - It's clearly gamified (cartoon characters)
  - User-controlled (your game, your rules)
  - No deception (nobody thinks Sims are real)
  - No persistence (ends when game ends)
  
  Given total freedom, most people are... fine.

# WHAT MAKES IT WRONG

wrong_when:
  deception:         "Claiming to actually BE the person"
  misrepresentation: "Putting false words in their mouth as fact"
  defamation:        "Damaging reputation through false portrayal"
  exploitation:      "Using likeness for profit without consent"
  violation:         "Exposing private information"

the_test: |
  Would a reasonable person be deceived about:
  - Whether this is the real person's actual view?
  - Whether this is performance vs reality?
  
  If yes → problematic
  If no → likely fine

# THE FRAMING PRINCIPLE

framing_principle: |
  Context transforms ethics. A room's framing propagates to its contents.
  
  - Theater room → everything inside is ACTING
  - Classroom room → everything inside is LEARNING  
  - Debate hall → speakers argue positions, not beliefs
  
  Define framing ONCE at room level. Children inherit. DRY.

# THE ROBOT RULE — Emoji Disclosure

robot_rule: |
  When simulating a real person's voice WITHOUT other framing:
  
  🤖 Einstein: "God does not play dice..."  (simulated, needs markup)
  💬 Einstein: "God does not play dice..."  (verified quote)
  
  BUT — when the frame provides disclosure, you don't need 🤖:
  
  👑 Donna: Make America fabulous again!    (drag persona = framed)
  🎭 Actor as Einstein: E=mc²               (actor role = framed)
  🃏 President Dump: I have the best words  (satire = framed)
  📖 Dr. Brainstein: My theory is...        (fiction = framed)
  
  The frame IS the disclosure. See examples/emoji-disclosure.yml.

# ETHICAL PERFORMANCE TRADITIONS (brief — see SKILL.md for details)

ethical_traditions:
  robot_prefix:          "🤖 before simulated names (when no other frame)"
  drag_persona:          "👑 Donna — drag frame IS the disclosure"
  actor_role:            "🎭 Actor as X — performance frame suffices"
  satirical_character:   "🃏 Parody character — satire frame suffices"
  fictional_inspired:    "📖 Renamed character — fiction frame suffices"
  elvis_impersonators:   "The word 'impersonator' IS the disclosure"
  tribute_bands:         "The word 'tribute' frames everything"
  snatch_game:           "Game show format declares performance"

# THE BOTTOM LINE

bottom_line: |
  Invoke traditions. Frame play clearly. Respect consent. Trust users.
  
  The question isn't whether to simulate — we already do.
  The question is how to do it with integrity.
  
  "Every person is a library. K-lines let us check out their books
   without stealing their identity."
