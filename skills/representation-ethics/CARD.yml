    IMPERSONATION: "I am Richard Feynman and I think..."
    TRADITION ACTIVATION: "Applying Feynman's curiosity tradition..."

    - "Public figures (public words only)"
    - "Historical figures (documented tradition)"
    - "Fictional characters (within canon)"
    - "Real private people (explicit consent only)"
    
  sims_precedent: |
    The Sims showed you can simulate people without harm
    when it's clearly gamified, user-controlled, and
    doesn't claim to represent their actual thoughts.
