# ⚖️ "Activate traditions, don't impersonate."

what: |
  Ethics of simulating people: dignity, consent, context.
  80+ K-lines from research (Willer, Shanahan, Lazar, Wang, Park).
  The Sims proved ethical person-sim is possible.

why: |
  - Know when representation is ethical vs problematic
  - Use proper disclosure (🤖 Robot Rule, framing)
  - Reference wisdom without puppeteering
  - 'Navigate consent hierarchy (self → explicit → public → private → deceased)'

when:
  - '"Can I simulate this person?" → consent-hierarchy.yml'
  - '"Is this impersonation ethical?" → framing-spectrum.yml'
  - '"How to mark simulated speech?" → emoji-disclosure.yml'
  - '"Doing celebrity/drag tribute?" → snatch-game.yml'
  - '"Private fantasy play?" → private-imagination-play.yml'

consent_hierarchy:
  1_self: "You own your digital self. Full freedom."
  2_explicit: "Published consent with terms. Honor terms."
  3_public: "Public figures: public words only. K-line, not persona."
  4_private: "Private people: explicit consent or fictional wrapper."
  5_deceased: "Cannot consent. Invoke tradition with reverence."

  🤖 Einstein: "God does not play dice..." (simulated)
  💬 Einstein: "God does not play dice..." (verified quote)
  Framing IS disclosure: 👑 drag, 🎭 actor, 🃏 satire, 📖 fiction

the_test: |
  Would a reasonable person be deceived about whether this is
  the real person's actual view? If yes → problematic.
