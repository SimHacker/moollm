# sister-script
# The script IS the documentation. The documentation IS the script.

id: sister-script
name: Sister Script
type: convention

definition: |
  A skill's executable script and its documentation are the same thing,
  or at minimum, tightly coupled and co-located. The script documents
  itself. The documentation is executable.

evolution_path: |
  Documentation → Procedure → Script → Tool

  1. You write documentation explaining how to do something
  2. The documentation becomes procedural (step-by-step)
  3. The procedure becomes a script (automated steps)
  4. The script becomes a tool (reusable, parameterized)

  At each stage, the previous stage is still readable in the result.
  A sister-script tool still reads like documentation.

rules:
  - Script and SKILL.md describe the same operations
  - Script's docstring matches SKILL.md's method descriptions
  - Changes to the script require updating the documentation (and vice versa)
  - The script follows sniffable-python — head explains everything

relationship_to_play_learn_lift: |
  Play-Learn-Lift produces sister-scripts:
    PLAY:  Do it manually, learn the steps
    LEARN: Notice patterns, write them down (documentation)
    LIFT:  Extract into a script that IS the documentation

canonical_example:
  skill: cursor-mirror
  script: skills/cursor-mirror/scripts/cursor_mirror.py
  documentation: skills/cursor-mirror/SKILL.md
  note: |
    cursor_mirror.py's docstring describes all 59 commands.
    SKILL.md describes the same commands as protocols.
    They are sister documents — same information, different stances.
