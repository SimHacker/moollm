# sniffable-python
# Layout convention for Python scripts in MOOLLM skills.

id: sniffable-python
name: Sniffable Python
type: convention

definition: |
  Structure Python scripts so the first 50-100 lines completely
  describe the API. An LLM reads the head to understand the
  entire script without reading the rest.

rules:
  - Docstring at top: all commands, arguments, gotchas, reference syntax
  - Use argparse, not click/typer/fire — CLI definition in one place at the top,
    not scattered across decorated functions throughout the file
  - Constants and configuration immediately after imports
  - Main entry point clearly defined
  - The rest of the file is implementation — underground, only dig when needed

rationale: |
  Same principle as the Semantic Image Pyramid applied within a single file.
  GLANCE→CARD→SKILL→README is progressive disclosure across files.
  Sniffable-python is progressive disclosure within a file.
  The head sticks above ground. The body is below.

canonical_example:
  file: skills/cursor-mirror/scripts/cursor_mirror.py
  total_lines: ~9800
  sniffable_head: 100
  commands_described_in_head: 59
  note: |
    An LLM can fully understand the interface from lines 1-100
    without reading the other 9,700 lines.
