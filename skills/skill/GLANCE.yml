what: |
  The meta-skill for creating, understanding, and debugging skills.
  Every skill you encounter was forged here.
  Eight MOOLLM extensions to Anthropic's skill model.

why: |
  - Create new reusable capabilities
  - Instantiate skill prototypes
  - Debug broken skills
  - Lift patterns to skills

when:
  - "Create new skill" → CREATE
  - "Instance from prototype" → INSTANTIATE
  - "Skill broken" → DEBUG
  - "Pattern worth generalizing" → LIFT

methods:
  CREATE: "CREATE [name] (tier) (prototypes)"
  INSTANTIATE: "INSTANTIATE [skill] AT [location]"
  DEBUG: "DEBUG [skill-path]"
  UPGRADE: "UPGRADE [skill] TO [tier]"
  LIFT: "LIFT [pattern] AS [name]"
  COMPOSE: "COMPOSE [skills] AS [name]"
