    The meta-skill for creating, understanding, and debugging skills.
    Every skill you encounter was forged here.
    
    MOOLLM's seven extensions (see designs/eval/EVAL-INCARNATE-FRAMEWORK.md):
    1. **Instantiation**: Skills as prototypes that create instances
    2. **Three-Tier Persistence**: Platform → Narrative → State
    3. **K-lines**: Names as semantic activation vectors (Minsky)
    4. **Empathic Templates**: Smart generation, not string substitution
    5. **Speed of Light**: Many turns in one call (33-turn Fluxx proof)
    6. **CARD.yml**: Machine-readable interface with advertisements
    7. **Ethical Framing**: Room-based inheritance of performance context
