# GLANCE.yml — honest-forget
# Full file: CARD.yml (157 lines) | SKILL.md
# 🪦 "Forget with integrity. Leave a tombstone."

what: |
  Graceful memory compression.
  When context overflows, summarize before forgetting.
  Leave pointer to where full version lives.

why: |
  - LLMs will forget
  - Context windows overflow
  - Never pretend to remember
  - Leave tombstones

when:
  - "Context too large" → COMPRESS
  - "Session ending" → ARCHIVE
  - "Need archived content" → RECALL
  - "Can't remember" → ADMIT honestly

methods:
  COMPRESS: "Summarize and mark for forgetting"
  ARCHIVE: "Move to long-term storage"
  RECALL: "Retrieve archived content"
  ADMIT: "Acknowledge forgotten content"

forget_schema: |
  original-path: archive/session-42.md
  summary: "Session 42: Found the key"
  forgotten-at: 2026-01-28T14:30:00Z
  reason: "Context overflow"

metadata_pattern: |
  Create lightweight sidecar instead of reading full file:
  file: adventure-log.md
  summary: "Session 12"
  size: 45KB
  worth-reading-if: "Need maze details"
  
  Sip metadata, then decide to read full file.

principle: |
  WRONG: "I remember everything"
  RIGHT: "I've forgotten details. Summary here. Full at archive/..."
  Leave tombstones. Point to graves. Never pretend.
