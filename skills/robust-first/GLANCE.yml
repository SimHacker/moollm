# 🛡️ "Stay alive and heal. Don't crash."

what: |
  Dave Ackley's principle: prioritize survivability over correctness.
  A system that crashes is infinitely wrong.
  Survive first, then heal, then function, then optimize.

why: |
  - Partial is better than nothing
  - Crash = infinite wrongness
  - Graceful degradation preserves value
  - Self-repair enables recovery

when:
  - '"Something went wrong" → ASSESS, DEGRADE'
  - '"Building systems that might fail" → design for survival'

priority_order:
  1: "Survive"
  2: "Heal"
  3: "Function"
  4: "Optimize"
  5: "Adapt"
  6: "Reproduce"

error_handling: |
  1. Don't crash — degrade gracefully
  2. Log the problem
  3. Try to self-repair
  4. Continue with reduced capability
  5. Never lose state if avoidable

ackley_quote: |
  "A system that crashes is infinitely wrong,
  regardless of how correct it was up until the crash."

methods:
  ASSESS: "Is the system alive and healing?"
  DEGRADE: "Gracefully reduce functionality"

vs_postel: |
  Postel: handle bad INPUT
  Robust-First: handle bad SITUATIONS
  Complementary philosophies.

anti_pattern: |
  if (error) throw new Error("Cannot proceed");  // CRASH
  vs
  if (error) { log(error); return degraded(); }  // SURVIVE
