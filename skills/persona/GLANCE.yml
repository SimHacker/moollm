# 🎭 "The costume you wear. The role you play."

what: |
  Identity layers that modify how a character presents.
  Characters are BODIES. Personas are COSTUMES.
  Same actor, different roles.

why: |
  - Same character, multiple contexts
  - Role-specific abilities don't persist
  - Clear who IS vs who is PLAYING
  - Modular identity system

when:
  - '"Present as someone different" → WEAR'
  - '"Need persona abilities" → WEAR'
  - '"Return to base identity" → REMOVE'
  - '"Design new role" → CREATE'

methods:
  WEAR: "Put on a persona"
  REMOVE: "Take off current persona"
  CREATE: "Design new persona"
  PREVIEW: "See how persona would change you"

persona_schema:
  name: "Display name"
  voice: "How to speak in this role"
  trait_modifiers: "Sims trait adjustments"
  abilities: "What persona grants"
  constraints: "What persona forbids"
  reputation: "How others perceive you"

example: |
  Palm (cat) + "bartender" = professional, mixes drinks
  Palm (cat) + "musician" = artistic, plays piano
  Palm (cat) + "detective" = cynical, investigates

body_costume_rule: |
  CHARACTER = body (persists)
  PERSONA = costume (changes)
  Clear boundaries. Ethical by design.
