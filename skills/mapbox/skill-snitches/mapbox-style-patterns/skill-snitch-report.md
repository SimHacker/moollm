## What it is

A pattern library of style recipes by use case: restaurant finder, real estate, dark mode, delivery, navigation.

## Notable

Eight reference files, and the one other skills borrow from — both data-visualization and
store-locator send readers to its references/interactions.md. It is the de facto shared
library of the corpus.

## Measured surface

| Measure | Value |
|---|---|
| Files | 11 |
| SKILL.md | 231 lines |
| AGENTS.md | 297 |
| References | 8 — common-modifications.md, dark-mode.md, data-viz-base.md, delivery-logistics.md, expressions-clustering.md, interactions.md, navigation.md, real-estate.md |
| Executable code | 0 files, 0 lines |
| Broken internal links | none |

### What the patterns found

| Probe | Hits | Reading |
|---|---|---|
| hardcoded access tokens | 0 | clean |
| shell-outs to network tools | 0 | clean |
| destructive or eval-shaped calls | 0 | clean |
| process spawns | 0 | absent |
| env-var token references | 0 | absent |
| agent-coercive directives | 0 | clean |
| explicit prohibitions | 0 | absent |
| user-location references | 2 | present, in context |
| OS permission references | 0 | absent |
| consent references | 0 | absent |
| privacy-law references | 0 | absent |

### Network destinations

None. This skill ships no executable code, so it reaches nothing.


Hosts named in prose and examples (1 distinct): `github.com`. Documentation text, not destinations.

## Findings

Nothing specific to this skill. The corpus-wide observations below still apply.

## Corpus-wide observations that also apply

- **MEDIUM · privacy-silence** — Across all twenty skills there is no guidance on data retention, minimization, anonymization, or GDPR/CCPA obligations.
- **INFO · no-allowed-tools** — Frontmatter carries name and description only.
- **LOW · postinstall-hook** — "postinstall": "node scripts/setup-hooks.js" — npm install runs code that writes an executable into .git/hooks.
- **INFO · eval-cost** — Evals are LLM-judged: claude-sonnet-5 answers (max_tokens 4096) and claude-sonnet-5 grades (max_tokens 2048), via @anthropic-ai/sdk, with every run reading the whole skill as input.

## Verdict

🟢 GREEN — Nothing here makes it unsafe to load or rely on.
