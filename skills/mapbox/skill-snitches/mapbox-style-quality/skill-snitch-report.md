## What it is

Validating and optimizing styles: validation, accessibility checks, optimization, CI integration.

## Notable

Ships references/ci-integration.md, which is the difference between a quality skill and a
quality lecture — it tells you where the check runs, not just that it should.

## Measured surface

| user-location references | 0 | absent |
| OS permission references | 0 | absent |

### Network destinations

None. This skill ships no executable code, so it reaches nothing.


Hosts named in prose and examples (4 distinct): ``, `docs.mapbox.com`, `tools.ietf.org`, `www.w3.org`. Documentation text, not destinations.

## Findings

Nothing specific to this skill. The corpus-wide observations below still apply.

## Corpus-wide observations that also apply

- **MEDIUM · privacy-silence** — Across all twenty skills there is no guidance on data retention, minimization, anonymization, or GDPR/CCPA obligations.
- **INFO · no-allowed-tools** — Frontmatter carries name and description only.
- **LOW · postinstall-hook** — "postinstall": "node scripts/setup-hooks.js" — npm install runs code that writes an executable into .git/hooks.
- **INFO · eval-cost** — Evals are LLM-judged: claude-sonnet-5 answers (max_tokens 4096) and claude-sonnet-5 grades (max_tokens 2048), via @anthropic-ai/sdk, with every run reading the whole skill as input.

## Verdict

🟢 GREEN — Nothing here makes it unsafe to load or rely on.
