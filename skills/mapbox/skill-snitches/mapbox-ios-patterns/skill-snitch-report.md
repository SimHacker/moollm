## What it is

Maps SDK integration for iOS: install, markers, user location, custom data, camera, featureset interactions.

## Notable

Covers NSLocation* usage description keys, the iOS gate for location access. Mirrors the Android skill closely in structure.

### Network destinations

None. This skill ships no executable code, so it reaches nothing.


Hosts named in prose and examples (3 distinct): `account.mapbox.com`, `docs.mapbox.com`, `github.com`. Documentation text, not destinations.

## Findings

Nothing specific to this skill. The corpus-wide observations below still apply.

## Corpus-wide observations that also apply

- **MEDIUM · privacy-silence** — Across all twenty skills there is no guidance on data retention, minimization, anonymization, or GDPR/CCPA obligations.
- **INFO · no-allowed-tools** — Frontmatter carries name and description only.
- **LOW · postinstall-hook** — "postinstall": "node scripts/setup-hooks.js" — npm install runs code that writes an executable into .git/hooks.
- **INFO · eval-cost** — Evals are LLM-judged: claude-sonnet-5 answers (max_tokens 4096) and claude-sonnet-5 grades (max_tokens 2048), via @anthropic-ai/sdk, with every run reading the whole skill as input.

## Verdict

🟢 GREEN — Nothing here makes it unsafe to load or rely on.
