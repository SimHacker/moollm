## What it is

Google Maps Platform to Mapbox GL JS: API equivalents, pattern translation, philosophy differences.

## Notable

Contains a When NOT to Migrate section. A migration skill that argues against itself under
stated conditions is more trustworthy than one that does not, and it is the correct shape for
a skill an agent will consult while holding a hammer.

### Network destinations

None. This skill ships no executable code, so it reaches nothing.


Hosts named in prose and examples (3 distinct): `api.mapbox.com`, `developers.google.com`, `docs.mapbox.com`. Documentation text, not destinations.

## Findings

Nothing specific to this skill. The corpus-wide observations below still apply.

## Corpus-wide observations that also apply

- **MEDIUM · privacy-silence** — Across all twenty skills there is no guidance on data retention, minimization, anonymization, or GDPR/CCPA obligations.
- **INFO · no-allowed-tools** — Frontmatter carries name and description only.
- **LOW · postinstall-hook** — "postinstall": "node scripts/setup-hooks.js" — npm install runs code that writes an executable into .git/hooks.
- **INFO · eval-cost** — Evals are LLM-judged: claude-sonnet-5 answers (max_tokens 4096) and claude-sonnet-5 grades (max_tokens 2048), via @anthropic-ai/sdk, with every run reading the whole skill as input.

Full text and reasoning: [`../README.md`](../README.md).

## Verdict

🟢 GREEN — Nothing here makes it unsafe to load or rely on.
