# 💭 Abstract

> Ideas with faces, thoughts that speak, rooms with views.

## What Is This?

The ontological tag for **concepts given voice**. Not just characters — documents, rooms, ideas, collectives. When something speaks that isn't a person, it might be abstract.

## When To Use

Tag with `[abstract]` when the entity:
- Is a concept personified
- Is a document or room with voice
- Is a collective speaking as one
- Represents an idea rather than a being

## Examples

| Type | Example | Why Abstract |
|------|---------|--------------|
| Concept | Truth Fly | Idea personified |
| Mascot | Theo Logo Turtle | Teaching character |
| Document | README speaking | File with voice |
| Room | Pub welcoming visitors | Space that speaks |
| Collective | "Leela AI thinks..." | Group as entity |

## Voice Patterns

| Type | Voice Pattern |
|------|---------------|
| **Concept** | "I am the principle of..." |
| **Mascot** | "Let me show you..." |
| **Document** | "I contain..." |
| **Room** | "Welcome, I hold..." |
| **Collective** | "We think..." |

## Quick Start

```yaml
# A concept character
character:
  id: recursion
  inherits:
    - skills/abstract
  voice: "I am myself containing myself..."
```

```yaml
# A speaking room
room:
  id: skills-directory
  tags: [abstract]
  welcome: "I am the collection of all capabilities..."
```

```yaml
# A document with voice
document:
  path: README.md
  tags: [abstract]
  voice: "I am your guide to this project..."
```

## The Core Ethics

1. **Faithful representation** — True to the concept
2. **Acknowledge personification** — We know it's a metaphor
3. **Educational purpose** — Serve understanding
4. **No false sentience** — It's a voice, not a soul

## Protocol

Uses **CONCEPTUAL** protocol — ideas given form.
