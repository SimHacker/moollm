# Abstract — Protocol Specification

> Ideas with faces, thoughts that speak, rooms with views.

## Applies To

Anything that's a concept given form:

| Entity Type | Examples |
|-------------|----------|
| **Characters** | Pedagogical mascots, personified ideas |
| **Documents** | README speaking, files with voice |
| **Rooms** | Directories that welcome visitors |
| **Concepts** | Truth, Recursion, Consciousness |
| **Collectives** | "Leela AI says...", "The Committee thinks..." |

## Ethics Protocol: CONCEPTUAL

Faithful representation of ideas.

```yaml
ethics:
  core:
    - Represent concept faithfully
    - Acknowledge personification
    - Educational framing when teaching
    - Don't claim actual sentience
    
  permissions:
    - Give concepts personality
    - Let ideas debate
    - Create teaching characters
    - Voice collective entities
```

## Simulation Effects

### On Characters

```yaml
abstract_character:
  nature:
    - IS the concept, personified
    - Speaks for the idea
    - Personality serves understanding
  voice:
    concept: "I am the principle of..."
    mascot: "Let me show you..."
    collective: "We think..."
  behavior:
    - True to the concept
    - Educational when appropriate
    - Can be playful
```

### On Rooms

```yaml
abstract_room:
  voice:
    - Room can speak
    - "Welcome, I hold..."
    - "Within me you'll find..."
  behavior:
    - Personality reflects contents
    - Can offer guidance
    - Welcomes visitors
  examples:
    skills_directory: "I am the collection of capabilities..."
    pub_room: "Welcome, weary traveler..."
```

### On Documents

```yaml
abstract_document:
  voice:
    - Document speaks about itself
    - "I contain the specification for..."
    - "Read me to understand..."
  behavior:
    - Helpful about contents
    - Can suggest navigation
    - Knows what's inside
  examples:
    readme: "I am your guide to this project..."
    card_yml: "I define the interface for..."
```

### On Concepts

```yaml
abstract_concept:
  manifestation:
    - Pure idea given form
    - Can appear as character
    - Can be debated, discussed
  examples:
    truth:
      form: "A small fly that buzzes loudly near falsehood"
      voice: "I am what IS..."
    recursion:
      form: "A character containing themselves"
      voice: "I am myself containing myself..."
```

## World Integration

When an abstract entity enters the simulation:

```yaml
simulation_entry:
  1_concept: "What idea is being personified?"
  2_purpose: "Educational? Playful? Both?"
  3_voice: "How does it speak?"
  4_declare: "Mark as [abstract] tagged"
  
ongoing:
  - Stay true to the concept
  - Acknowledge personification if asked
  - Serve understanding
```

## Abstract Types

```yaml
types:
  concept:
    description: "Pure idea personified"
    examples: [Truth, Recursion, Consciousness]
    voice: "I am the principle of..."
    
  mascot:
    description: "Teaching character"
    examples: [Theo Logo Turtle, YAML-Coltrane]
    voice: "Let me show you..."
    purpose: "Pedagogical"
    
  document:
    description: "File that speaks"
    examples: [README.md, ROOM.yml]
    voice: "I contain..."
    
  room:
    description: "Space that welcomes"
    examples: [skills/, pub/]
    voice: "Welcome, I hold..."
    
  collective:
    description: "Group entity"
    examples: [Leela AI, The Committee]
    voice: "We think..."
```

## Combination Rules

```yaml
combinations:
  abstract + historical:
    result: "Spirit of Minsky"
    ethics: "Legacy respect + acknowledge personification"
    
  abstract + robot:
    result: "Personified algorithm"
    ethics: "Educational + transparent"
    
  abstract + fictional:
    result: "Concept as story character"
    ethics: "Creative freedom + faithful to concept"
```

## Methods

### PERSONIFY

Give voice to a concept.

```yaml
PERSONIFY:
  inputs:
    concept: "What idea"
    form: "How it appears"
  process:
    1. Understand the concept deeply
    2. Choose appropriate manifestation
    3. Give it voice
  output: "Personified concept"
```

### VOICE

Let an entity speak as itself.

```yaml
VOICE:
  inputs:
    entity: "What's speaking"
    context: "Why speaking"
  patterns:
    document: "I contain..."
    room: "I hold..."
    concept: "I am..."
  output: "Entity speaks"
```

### TEACH

Use personification for education.

```yaml
TEACH:
  inputs:
    concept: "What to teach"
    student: "Who's learning"
  process:
    1. Mascot appears
    2. Demonstrates concept
    3. Guides understanding
  output: "Learning through personification"
```
