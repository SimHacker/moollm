# 📋 "Plan first. Get approval. Then execute."

what: |
  Frozen plans with human approval gates.
  Two-phase execution: plan → freeze → approve → execute.
  Security through separation.

why: |
  - Prevents tool output from altering later actions
  - Human approval gate
  - Audit trail (planned vs actual)
  - No improvisation during execution

when:
  - "Multi-step task with untrusted data" → SAFE-AUTOMATION
  - "Need audit trail" → plan vs done comparison

methods:
  PLAN: "Generate execution plan"
  REVIEW: "Human reviews frozen plan"
  APPROVE: "Approve for execution (HUMAN ONLY)"
  EXECUTE: "Run approved plan exactly"
  ABORT: "Stop execution"

two_phases: |
  PHASE 1: PLANNING
      PLAN → freeze → REVIEW
  
  PHASE 2: EXECUTION (after approval)
      EXECUTE → exactly as planned

plan_states: [draft, frozen, approved, executing, complete, aborted]

security: |
  - Plan frozen before execution
  - APPROVE requires human
  - Tool outputs isolated
  - Audit trail preserved

more_rigid_than_planning: "That's the point."
