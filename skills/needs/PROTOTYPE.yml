  name: needs
  tier: 1
  protocol: NEEDS-AS-MOTIVATION

    Needs fluctuate over time and drive behavior.
    Low needs create urgency. Satisfied needs enable other activities.
    Comments update to reflect inner voice.
  motto: "Needs drive the story. Low needs create urgency."

# SCALE

scale:
  range: "0-10"
  meaning:
    10: "Fully satisfied"
    7-9: "Comfortable"
    4-6: "Manageable"
    2-3: "Urgent"
    0-1: "Critical"

# INNER VOICE (YAML Jazz)

yaml_jazz_comments:
  description: |
    Need values have DYNAMIC COMMENTS that serve as inner voice.
    Comments update when values change!
    
  examples:
    hunger:
      high: "hunger: 7  # Satisfied. No food thoughts."
      medium: "hunger: 5  # Could eat. Not urgent."
      low: "hunger: 3  # Getting peckish. Is that pie?"
      critical: "hunger: 1  # FOOD. FOOD. FOOD. FOOD."
      
    energy:
      high: "energy: 8  # Wide awake. Let's DO things."
      medium: "energy: 5  # Fine. Maybe coffee later."
      low: "energy: 2  # So tired. Everything is hard."
      critical: "energy: 1  # Can't... keep... eyes..."
      
    social:
      high: "social: 9  # People are great. I love everyone."
      medium: "social: 5  # Could use a chat."
      low: "social: 2  # Is anyone there? Hello?"

# DECAY

decay:
  timing: "Needs decay over simulation turns"
  factors:
    - "Base decay rate"
    - "Personality traits (Active, Outgoing)"
    - "Current location effects"
    - "Active buffs"
    - "Dribble food to bladder"

# SATISFACTION

satisfaction:
  actions: "Most needs satisfied by specific actions"
  locations: "Some locations satisfy needs passively (home, pub)"
  items: "Some items satisfy needs (food, bed)"
  social: "Interactions can satisfy social need"

# CRITICAL NEEDS

critical_needs:
  description: |
    When a need hits critical level, behavior changes:
    - Inner voice becomes URGENT
    - Other activities interrupted
    - May trigger autonomous actions
    
  example: |
    hunger: 1
    # I CAN'T THINK ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE
    # IS THERE FOOD? WHERE IS FOOD?
    # [Character may abandon current task to find food]
