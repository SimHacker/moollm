# 🔋 "Needs drive behavior. Unmet needs cause problems."

what: |
  Sims-style dynamic motivations that decay over time.
  Objects advertise based on which needs they satisfy.
  Lowest need wins. Emergent behavior without scripting.

why: |
  - Motivation-driven autonomous agents
  - Natural priority: lowest need wins
  - 25 years of proven game design (The Sims)

when:
  - "Character behavior should be need-driven" → enable needs
  - "Why is character doing that?" → CHECK needs

needs:
  hunger: "decay: 5 — food, cooking"
  energy: "decay: 3 — sleep, rest"
  fun: "decay: 4 — games, entertainment"
  social: "decay: 2 — conversation, groups"
  hygiene: "decay: 2 — shower, sink"
  bladder: "decay: 4 — toilet"
  comfort: "decay: 1 — good furniture"
  room: "decay: 1 — nice surroundings"

methods:
  CHECK: "View character's current needs"
  SATISFY: "Fulfill a need"
  DECAY: "Reduce needs over time"
  URGENT: "Find most pressing need"

advertising_loop: |
  Needs decay → Low needs increase motivation →
  Objects advertise → Agents queue actions →
  Actions satisfy → Loop
