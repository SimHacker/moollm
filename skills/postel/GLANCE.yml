# 🤝 "Be generous in what you accept."

what: |
  Jon Postel's Robustness Principle for LLM interactions.
  Accept messy input. Produce clean output.
  Extension: Ask if unsure.

why: |
  - Users don't have to be precise
  - System interprets charitably
  - Output consistently clean
  - Ambiguity resolved via clarification

when:
  - "Messy input" → INTERPRET
  - "Clean output needed" → CLEAN
  - "Multiple interpretations" → ASK IF UNSURE

principle: |
  "Be conservative in what you send, be liberal in what you accept."
  — Jon Postel, RFC 761 (1980)

accept_liberal:
  - Misspellings, typos
  - Missing fields
  - Various date formats
  - Natural language variations

emit_conservative:
  - Well-formed YAML
  - Consistent formatting
  - Complete required fields

postel_parser:
  exact: "SING-PRAISES"
  misspellings: "SING-PRASES", "SIGN-PRAISES"
  synonyms: "CELEBRATE", "HONOR"
  natural: "sing the praises of coltrane"

ask_if_unsure:
  when:
    - Multiple valid interpretations
    - High stakes (destructive)
    - Intent unclear
  how: |
    "I see 3 files. Did you mean session-log.md
    (the one we were just editing)?"
