# GLANCE.yml — container
# Full file: CARD.yml (124 lines) | SKILL.md
# 📦 "Grouping without layout."

what: |
  Intermediate scope for inheritance and containment.
  Like OpenLaszlo's <node> — directories with inheritance
  but not navigable rooms.

why: |
  - Define shared properties
  - Flow to all children
  - Rules within scope
  - Ambient environmental properties

when:
  - "Grouping entities" → CONTAINER.yml
  - "Shared defaults" → inherits section
  - "Environmental properties" → ambient

file: CONTAINER.yml

schema:
  name: "Display name"
  description: "What it represents"
  inherits: "Properties flowing to children"
  rules: "Rules within scope"
  defaults: "Default values for children"
  constraints: "Things forbidden"
  on_enter: "Expression for entering child"
  on_exit: "Expression for exiting child"
  ambient: "sound, smell, temperature, light, danger"
