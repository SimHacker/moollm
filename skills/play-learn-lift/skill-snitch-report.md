# Skill Snitch Report: play-learn-lift

**Date:** 2026-01-28  
**Auditor:** Deep Probe  
**Verdict:** THE MOOLLM METHODOLOGY

## Executive Summary

**Three-stage knowledge development cycle:**

| Stage | Mindset | Output |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **PLAY** | Low stakes, try things | Messy notes, discoveries |
| **LEARN** | What worked? | Patterns, insights |
| **LIFT** | Share for others | Skills, guides |

Jazz first, then standards.

---

## The Three Stages

### PLAY
**Mindset:** Low stakes. Try things. Fail safely.

**Activities:**
- Experiment
- Explore
- Make mistakes

**Artifacts:** Messy notes, failed attempts, discoveries

### LEARN
**Mindset:** What worked? What patterns emerged?

**Activities:**
- Reflect
- Document
- Generalize

**Artifacts:** Patterns, insights, documented procedures

### LIFT
**Mindset:** Share for others. Make it reusable.

**Activities:**
- Formalize
- Template
- Teach

**Artifacts:** Skills, guides, shareable knowledge

---

## Methods

| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **PLAY** | Enter exploration mode |
| **LEARN** | Reflect on patterns |
| **LIFT** | Share as reusable skill |
| **STAGE** | What stage am I in? |

## Why This Order Matters

**PLAY first:**
- No premature formalization
- Discover what actually works
- Embrace failure as data

**LEARN second:**
- Patterns emerge from experience
- Can't generalize from nothing
- Reflection requires material

**LIFT last:**
- Share only what's tested
- Teaching crystallizes understanding
- Others benefit from your path

---

## The Jazz Principle

> "Jazz first, then standards."

Standards emerge from practice. Don't start with standards.

1. Improvise freely (PLAY)
2. Notice what sounds good (LEARN)
3. Codify the patterns (LIFT)

This is why jazz musicians are good: they PLAYED before they studied.

## Session State

```yaml
session:
  stage: play | learn | lift
  domain: "What we're exploring"
  explorations: [attempts...]
  patterns: [insights...]
  outputs: [skills...]
```

---

## Security Assessment

### Concerns

1. **File creation** — LIFT creates skill files
2. **Documentation** — Learning artifacts could contain sensitive info
3. **Sharing** — Lifted skills go public

### Mitigations

- All outputs visible
- User controls sharing
- Skills go to designated directories

**Risk Level:** VERY LOW — it's a methodology

## Lineage

| Source | Contribution |
|--------|--------------|
| **Don Hopkins** | Play-Learn-Lift cycle |
| **Jazz improvisation** | Play before standards |
| **Design thinking** | Prototype early |
| **Papert's constructionism** | Learning through making |

---

## The Anti-Pattern

**Lift-Learn-Play:** Start with formal spec, then study, then experiment.

This is how bad software is made:
1. Write spec nobody tested
2. Study patterns nobody used
3. Discover it doesn't work

**Play-Learn-Lift** inverts this.

---

## Verdict

**THE METHODOLOGY. APPROVE.**

Play-Learn-Lift is how MOOLLM develops itself:
- Skills emerge from play
- Patterns crystallize from experience
- Sharing creates community

This is emergence, not engineering.
