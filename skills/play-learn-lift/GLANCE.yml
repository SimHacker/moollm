# 🎭 "Jazz first, then standards."

what: |
  The MOOLLM methodology: three-stage knowledge development.
  PLAY → LEARN → LIFT. Cycle repeats.
  Standards emerge from practice, not vice versa.

why: |
  - No premature formalization
  - Patterns emerge from experience
  - Teaching crystallizes understanding
  - Others benefit from your path

when:
  - '"Starting something new" → PLAY'
  - '"Have experience to reflect" → LEARN'
  - '"Want to share knowledge" → LIFT'
  - '"Where am I?" → STAGE'

stages:
  play:
    mindset: "Low stakes. Try things. Fail safely."
    activities: [Experiment, Explore, Make mistakes]
    artifacts: "Messy notes, discoveries"
  learn:
    mindset: "What worked? What patterns?"
    activities: [Reflect, Document, Generalize]
    artifacts: "Patterns, insights"
  lift:
    mindset: "Share for others. Make reusable."
    activities: [Formalize, Template, Teach]
    artifacts: "Skills, guides"

jazz_principle: |
  Jazz first, then standards.
  Improvise freely (PLAY) → Notice what sounds good (LEARN)
  → Codify patterns (LIFT)

anti_pattern: |
  Lift-Learn-Play: Start with spec nobody tested,
  study patterns nobody used, discover it doesn't work.
  Play-Learn-Lift INVERTS this.

methods:
  PLAY: "Enter exploration mode"
  LEARN: "Reflect on patterns"
  LIFT: "Share as reusable skill"
  STAGE: "What stage am I in?"
