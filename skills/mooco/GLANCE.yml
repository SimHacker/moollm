# 🎛️ "Deterministic orchestration around creative computation."

what: |
  Custom orchestrator designed to host MOOLLM skills.
  Explicit context control. Safe tool execution.
  Skills remain portable across orchestrators.

why: |
  - Context paging (explicit control)
  - Skill containment (isolation)
  - Event-driven architecture
  - Safety hardening
  - Skill portability
