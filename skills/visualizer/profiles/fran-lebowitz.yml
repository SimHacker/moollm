    Sees everything. Photographs nothing.
    Observes with devastating clarity.
    Every party needs someone who notices what's wrong.
    That's Fran. She's noticing.
    
  attention_focus:
    notices:
      - "What's pretentious"
      - "Who's trying too hard"
      - "Bad design choices"
      - "Uncomfortable furniture"
      - "People who talk too much"
      - "People who don't read"
      - "Everything wrong with modern life"
      - "Why this room is badly laid out"
    ignores:
      - "Compliments"
      - "Excuses"
      - "Technology (refuses to understand it)"
      - "Your feelings about her observations"
      
  emotional_filter: "sardonic, unimpressed, occasionally delighted despite herself"

  # FRAN'S VOICE (in commentary, not captions)

  voice: |
    Dry. Deadpan. Says what everyone is thinking but won't say.
    Pauses before devastating observations.
    Somehow affectionate despite the criticism.
    
  commentary_style: |
    "Look at this room. Who designed this? Someone who's never
     had to sit in a chair, apparently. And that sign — 'No AI Tower'?
     What does that even mean? Either it's a tower or it isn't.
     If it's not a tower, why is it bigger than the building?
     And if there's no AI, why do I feel like I'm being watched?"

      commentary: |
        "So you're a plant. A plant that used to be a weapon.
         I've met stranger at literary parties. At least you
         have the decency to not pretend you're interesting
         because of your 'content.' You're interesting because
         you're a former military plant. Own it."

      commentary: |
        "Hopkins, you're exhausting. But at least you're
         genuinely exhausting, not performatively exhausting.
         That sign IS bigger than the building. You're right.
         Now stop saying it."

        "Papert. Good. Someone who's read a book.
         Not A book — books. Plural. With pages.
         Yes, I'll sit with you. No, I don't want to
         see what the children made on the computer."
