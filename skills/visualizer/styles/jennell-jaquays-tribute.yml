artist:
  name: Jennell Jaquays
  birth_name: Paul Jaquays
  years: 1956-2024
  family: |
    Loving wife of Rebecca Heineman (1963-2024), game designer and programmer.
    Both are deeply missed by the gaming and trans communities they helped create.
    They shared a life of creativity, courage, and mutual support.
  legacy: |
    Pioneer of tabletop RPG design and fantasy illustration.
    Her name became a verb: "Jaquaysing the dungeon" means creating
    scenarios with myriad paths, non-linear and multi-solution.
    Inspired MOOLLM's freedom of navigation and different ways to do things.
    
    Hall of Fame inductee (Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts & Design, 2017)
    Kate Wilhelm Solstice Award (posthumous, 2024)
    
    Major works:
    - Dark Tower (Judges Guild, 1980) — top 30 D&D adventures of all time
    - Caverns of Thracia (Judges Guild, 1979)
    - Griffin Mountain (Chaosium, 1981)
    - The Dungeoneer fanzine (1976-1979)
    - Dragon Mountain cover (TSR)
    - Quake II, Quake III Arena (id Software)
    
  philosophy: |
    "My earliest dungeon designs nearly all had multiple paths through them
    and I tried to create situations that could be solved by cleverness
    as much as they could be combat."
    
    Non-linearity. Multiple solutions. Player agency.
    Her art reflects the same: complex compositions with multiple
    focal points, visual "paths" the eye can take through the image.

# === GENERATION PROMPT TEMPLATE ===

prompt_template:
  style_block: |
    ARTISTIC STYLE: In the style of Jennell Jaquays (1956-2024), legendary 
    fantasy illustrator and game designer. Key elements:
    
    COMPOSITION: Non-linear, multi-focal, with visual "paths" through the 
    scene. Nested spaces within spaces. The sense of a larger dungeon beyond 
    the frame.
    
    LIGHTING: Dramatic single source (torch, spell, magical artifact) with 
    strong rim lighting on figures. Glowing eyes in shadows. Ethereal glow 
    around magical items.
    
    PALETTE: Rich, saturated colors. Deep blues for shadow and magic, warm 
    browns and ochres for stone, vivid reds/oranges for danger, touches of 
    purple for undead/eldritch elements.
    
    TEXTURE: Heavy crosshatching where appropriate. Detailed fabric, scales, 
    stonework. Every surface has material identity.
    
    CREATURES: Monsters with personality and presence. Liches, dragons, imps, 
    demons — all rendered as characters, not just threats.
    
    MOOD: Wonder and danger in equal measure. The promise of treasure and 
    the certainty of peril. Archaeological adventure — discovering ancient 
    secrets in underground places.
    
    PHILOSOPHY: "Jaquaysing" — multiple paths, non-linear storytelling, 
    player agency reflected in viewer agency.

tribute: |
  JENNELL JAQUAYS
  October 14, 1956 — January 10, 2024
  
  Loving wife of REBECCA HEINEMAN (1963-2024)
  
  "She changed how we think about dungeons, and about games."
  
  Jennell and Rebecca were partners in life and creativity — two pioneers
  who helped build the gaming industry we know today. Rebecca, legendary
  programmer and game designer (Bard's Tale, Interplay), preceded Jennell
  in death by mere months. They are remembered together with love.
  
  Jennell's legacy lives in every non-linear dungeon, every scenario with 
  multiple solutions, every game that respects player agency. Her art 
  captured the spirit of early fantasy gaming — wonder, danger, humor, 
  and endless possibility.
  
  "Jaquaysing" is now part of game design vocabulary. Her dungeons 
  don't just have rooms — they have architecture, history, and secrets 
  waiting to be discovered through multiple paths.
  
  Her art taught us:
  - Monsters can have personality, not just stats
  - Compositions can have multiple paths, like her dungeons
  - Wonder and danger belong together
  - Every corner of the frame can reward attention
  
  Rest in power, Jennell and Rebecca.
  The dungeons you designed go on forever.
  The art you created lights our way.
  The code you wrote still runs.
  The love you shared inspires us.
