# Minox Spy Camera — The Cold War Classic
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#
# "What fits in your palm can bring down governments."
#
# The subminiature camera that lived in coat pockets and changed history.
# Document drops. Embassy parties. Microfilm. The stuff of le Carré novels.
# So small you photograph documents by feel, not looking through a viewfinder.

    The spy camera. Fits in a cigarette pack.

    CIA. KGB. MI6. Mossad. Stasi.
    
    Hold it flat against documents, guess the distance,
    click. The microfilm goes in a dead drop.

  cultural_note: |
    The Minox wasn't designed for espionage.
    Walter Zapp invented it for travelers who wanted
    a camera that fit anywhere.
    
    But the Cold War found its true purpose.
    Both sides used it. Both sides feared it.
    A Minox in the wrong hands meant secrets leaked,
    agents burned, policies exposed.
    
    The grain and contrast aren't bugs.
    They're the texture of betrayal.

      Ada II recognizes the Minox.
      She's seen its work. Maybe done its work.
      The targeting system has different memories
      than the plant does.
