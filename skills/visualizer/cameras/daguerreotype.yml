  id: daguerreotype
  name: "Daguerreotype Camera"
  inventor: "Louis Daguerre"
  era: "1839-1860s"
  origin: "France"
  type: "view-camera"
  format: "Silver-plated copper plate"
  
  description: |
    The first commercially successful photography process.
    Polish a silver-plated copper sheet. Sensitize with iodine fumes.
    Expose for 1-30 minutes. Develop with mercury vapor.
    Fix with salt solution. Handle with care forever.
    
    Each image is unique — there is no negative.
    
  physical:
    body: "Wooden box camera with bellows"
    lens: "Brass-mounted Petzval or simple meniscus"
    plate_sizes: "Whole plate (6.5x8.5\") to sixteenth plate"
    shutter: "Lens cap (manual)"
    
  process:
    dangerous: true
    steps:
      - "Polish silver plate to mirror finish"
      - "Sensitize with iodine fumes"
      - "Load in complete darkness"
      - "Expose (1-30 minutes depending on light)"
      - "Develop with mercury vapor (TOXIC)"
      - "Fix with sodium thiosulfate"
      - "Wash and dry"
      - "Mount under glass (fragile surface)"
      
  characteristics:
    unique:
      - "One-of-a-kind (no negative)"
      - "Mirror-like surface"
      - "Incredible detail (no grain)"
      - "Positive/negative depending on angle"
    limitations:
      - "Minutes-long exposure"
      - "Subject must remain still"
      - "Very fragile surface"
      - "Mercury is deadly poison"
      
  visual_effects:
    always:
      - "Mirror-like silver surface"
      - "Extreme sharpness (molecular level)"
      - "Monochrome (blue-gray to warm tones)"
      - "Formal, stiff poses (necessity)"
      - "Ghost blur on anything that moved"
    often:
      - "Hand-tinted color (post-process)"
      - "Velvet-lined case presentation"
      - "Gold toning (preservation)"
    unique_quality:
      - "Positive from one angle, negative from another"
      - "Must be held at correct angle to view"
      
  prompt_modifiers:
    add:
      - "daguerreotype photograph"
      - "mirror-like silver surface"
      - "extreme sharpness and detail"
      - "formal posed subjects"
      - "sepia/silver monochrome tones"
      - "1840s portrait photography"
    constraints:
      - "subject perfectly still (long exposure)"
      - "ghost blur on movement"
      - "formal, serious expression"
    style: "1840s daguerreotype, precious and formal"
    
  famous_examples:
    - "Robert Cornelius self-portrait (1839)"
    - "Dorothy Catherine Draper (1840)"
    - "Frederick Douglass portraits"
    - "Abraham Lincoln (by Brady)"

    "From today, painting is dead."
    — Paul Delaroche, on seeing a daguerreotype
    
    The daguerreotype made immortality available
    to the middle class for the first time.
    Before, only the rich could afford portraits.
    
    Each daguerreotype is a one-of-a-kind artifact,
    more like a painting than modern photography.
