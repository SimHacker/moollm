camera:
  id: iphone-15-pro
  name: "iPhone 15 Pro"
  manufacturer: "Apple"
  era: "2023-present"
  type: "smartphone"
  format: "digital (48MP sensor)"
  
  description: |
    Three cameras, one brain.
    The A17 Pro does more processing per shot than
    a 1990s supercomputer did in a year.
    Night Mode, Portrait Mode, Cinematic Mode.
    Photography becomes computation.
    
  physical:
    main: "48MP, f/1.78, 24mm equiv, sensor-shift OIS"
    ultrawide: "12MP, f/2.2, 13mm equiv"
    telephoto: "12MP, f/2.8, 77mm equiv, 3x optical"
    processor: "A17 Pro (neural engine)"
    
  characteristics:
    computational:
      - "Deep Fusion (pixel-level optimization)"
      - "Smart HDR 5 (tone mapping)"
      - "Night Mode (multi-frame stacking)"
      - "Portrait Mode (neural depth)"
      - "Photographic Styles (real-time grading)"
    traditional:
      - "Fast autofocus"
      - "Excellent stabilization"
      - "4K/60 video"
      - "ProRAW/ProRes options"
      
  visual_effects:
    always:
      - "Computational HDR look"
      - "Lifted shadows"
      - "Recovered highlights"
      - "Sharpened details"
      - "Noise reduction (sometimes over-aggressive)"
    portrait_mode:
      - "Simulated bokeh"
      - "Edge detection artifacts (hair)"
      - "Depth estimation errors possible"
    night_mode:
      - "Multi-second exposure stacked"
      - "Bright shadows (surreal)"
      - "Reduced motion blur"
    common:
      - "Slightly oversaturated"
      - "Skin smoothing"
      - "HDR glow around edges"
      
  prompt_modifiers:
    add:
      - "iPhone photography"
      - "computational HDR"
      - "lifted shadows, controlled highlights"
      - "sharp details, noise-reduced"
    portrait:
      - "simulated bokeh"
      - "subject separation"
    night:
      - "night mode, bright shadows"
      - "multi-frame stacking"
    style: "modern smartphone photography, social media ready"
    
  processing_pipeline: |
    1. Multi-frame capture (always)
    2. Neural engine analysis
    3. Pixel-by-pixel optimization
    4. Tone mapping (Smart HDR)
    5. Noise reduction
    6. Sharpening
    7. Style application
    8. HEIC compression
    
  cultural_note: |
    The iPhone doesn't capture reality —
    it computes an optimized version of reality.
    
    "Good enough" became "always perfect"
    but also "never raw."
    
    The death of bad photos is also
    the death of authentic moments.
