  description: |
    Single-use camera with everything built in.
    Plastic lens, fixed focus, fixed everything.
    You buy it, shoot it, return the whole thing for processing.
    The great equalizer — everyone shoots the same way.

  cultural_note: |
    The FunSaver democratized photography.
    Before smartphones, this was how normal people
    documented their lives. No skill required.
    
    The "disposable camera aesthetic" is now
    deliberately sought for authenticity.
    
  variants:
    - "FunSaver (standard)"
    - "FunSaver Weekend (waterproof)"
    - "FunSaver Portrait (longer lens)"
    - "FunSaver Flash (800 ISO for parties)"
