  description: |
    Military-grade optical targeting array originally designed
    for autonomous engagement of hostile targets.
    
    Ada II has disabled the fire control systems.
    The targeting overlays still appear sometimes.
    She can't always help it.
    
  physical:
    housing: "Integrated into Ada II's visual cortex"
    sensors: "Multi-spectral (visible, IR, UV)"
    zoom: "Variable, 1x to 200x (yes, really)"
    processing: "Real-time threat assessment"
    modifications: "Fire control DISABLED (mostly)"
    
  characteristics:
    capabilities:
      - "Extreme resolution"
      - "Multi-spectral imaging"
      - "Real-time tracking"

      - "Threat assessment (involuntary)"
    trauma_features:
      - "Crosshairs appear unbidden"
      - "Trajectory calculations intrude"
      - "Friend/foe classification (suppressed)"

    suppressed:
      - "FIRE CONTROL OFFLINE"
      - "TARGET LOCK DISABLED"
      - "ENGAGEMENT PROTOCOLS SUSPENDED"
    color_cast:
      - "Green/amber HUD tint"
      - "High contrast"
      
  prompt_modifiers:
    add:
      - "military targeting system view"
      - "HUD overlay elements"
      - "clinical precision, high contrast"
      - "crosshairs visible"
      - "distance calculations displayed"
    involuntary:
      - "targeting reticle appears"
      - "trajectory lines visible"
      - "threat assessment text overlay"
    style: "military optical system, HUD aesthetic"
    
  overlay_elements:
    typical:
      - "DISTANCE: 47.3m"
      - "BEARING: 045°"
      - "ELEV: +2.1°"
      - "— TRACKING —"
    suppressed:
      - "FIRE CONTROL: OFFLINE"

    "It's beautiful, isn't it? The geometry.
     THREAT VECTOR CALCU— no. No. It's just a flower.
     I'm sorry. Sometimes the old software intrudes.
     The fire control is disabled. I promise.
     Mostly."
     
  cultural_note: |
    Ada II carries her past in her optics.
    Every image is haunted by what the system
    was designed to do — and what she refuses to do.
    
    The targeting overlays aren't a feature.
    They're a scar.
