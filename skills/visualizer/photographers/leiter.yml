# Saul Leiter — Color Through Glass
#
# "I spent a great deal of my life being ignored."
#
# Pioneer of color street photography, decades before it was accepted.
# Painterly, abstracted, intimate. Looking through windows, reflections,
# rain-streaked glass. The world as layers of color and form.

      Color as form, not documentation. Looking through things.
      Rain-streaked windows, reflections layered on reality,
      figures obscured by urban detritus. Intimate, quiet, observational.
      Painterly — he was a painter before photographer.
