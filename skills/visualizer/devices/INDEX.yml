    Imaging devices inherit from visualizer.
    Describe the device, visualizer improvises visual effects.
    
  inheritance: visualizer
  
  philosophy: |
    Don't enumerate device types — DESCRIBE them.
    The visualizer reads description and improvises:
    - Era → color science, artifacts
    - Quality → sharpness, noise
    - Quirks → happy accidents
