# 🎯 "A quest objective that drives the adventure forward."

what: |
  Quest objective primitive with completion conditions,
  failure conditions, priorities, rewards, and dependencies.
  Goals can nest into hierarchies.

why: |
  - Drive adventure forward
  - Track player progress
  - Define success/failure
  - Reward completion

when:
  - "Create quest" → goal with complete_when
  - "Track progress" → goal.progress
  - "Nested objectives" → goal.children

schema:
  required: [id, name, description, complete_when]
  optional: [status, priority, reward, fail_when, parent, children, requires, blocks, given_by]
  compiled: [complete_when_js, fail_when_js]

statuses: [pending, active, complete, failed]
priorities: [low, normal, high, urgent]

hierarchy: |
  goal: defeat-evil
    children:
      - find-magic-sword
      - train-with-master
      - storm-castle
  Parent completes when children complete.

dependencies:
  requires: "Must be done first"
  blocks: "Can't start until this completes"
  parent: "Part of larger goal"
  children: "Sub-goals"

postal_integration: |
  Any character can give goals via mail:
  letter.creates_goal: { name, reward }

compiled_conditions: |
  complete_when → complete_when_js, complete_when_py
  fail_when → fail_when_js, fail_when_py
