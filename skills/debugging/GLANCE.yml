# 🐛 "Debugging is an adventure. The bug is the treasure."

what: |
  Hypothesis-driven bug hunting.
  Form theories, test them, narrow down.
  Adventure where the bug is the treasure.

why: |
  - Systematic investigation
  - Track hypotheses
  - Binary search (bisect)
  - Document findings

when:
  - '"Something broken" → START'
  - '"Theory about cause" → HYPOTHESIZE'
  - '"Test theory" → TEST'
  - '"When introduced?" → BISECT'

methods:
  START: "Begin investigation"
  HYPOTHESIZE: "Form a theory"
  TEST: "Test hypothesis"
  NARROW: "Eliminate possibilities"
  TRACE: "Follow execution path"
  BISECT: "Binary search for introduction"
  FIX: "Apply fix"
  DOCUMENT: "Record findings"

session_states: [investigating, narrowing, fixing, verifying, resolved, abandoned]

strategies:
  wolf_fence: "Bisect the search space"
  rubber_duck: "Explain out loud"
  simplify: "Remove complexity"
  fresh_eyes: "Step away, return later"
  assumptions: "Question what you 'know'"

bisect: |
  good ←────────────→ bad
          test midpoint
       good?         bad?
