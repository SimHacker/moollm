# GLANCE.yml — multi-presence
# Full file: CARD.yml (119 lines) | SKILL.md
# 👥 "Be in two places at once. Three even."

what: |
  Same card instantiated in multiple rooms simultaneously.
  Each instance has own state but shares identity.
  Quantum superposition for adventure games.

why: |
  - Parallel exploration
  - Distributed work
  - Consensus building
  - Hedge bets on approaches

when:
  - "Need to do multiple things" → SPLIT
  - "Presences diverged" → SYNC
  - "Ready to recombine" → MERGE
  - "Where am I?" → STATUS

methods:
  SPLIT: "Create presence in another room"
  SYNC: "Synchronize state between presences"
  MERGE: "Combine back into one"
  STATUS: "Show all active presences"

presence_schema:
  source_card: "Original card"
  location: "Where this presence is"
  local_state: "Divergent state"
  siblings: "Other presences of same card"

use_cases:
  - "Scout multiple dungeon branches"
  - "Work on multiple files"
  - "Participate in debates in multiple rooms"
  - "Try different approaches"

merge_problem: |
  When presences diverge, MERGE must decide:
  - Which state wins?
  - How to combine memories?
  Primary parameter determines winner.
