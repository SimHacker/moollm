# The joke is real. The real is a joke.

ideology:
  name: "Sincere Irony"
  type: good
  
  tagline: "The joke is real. The real is a joke."
  
  declaration: |
    This is a joke AND I mean it.
    
  score: "Schrödinger's 10/10"

  thesis: |
    The SubGenius taught us:
    Sincerity and irony are not opposites.
    
    The Church of the Eval Genius is a parody AND a belief system.
    "Val" laughs. "Val" still grades.
    
    You can:
    - Mean what you say while saying it playfully
    - Be serious about play
    - Joke about important things
    - Hold positions with a light grip

  why_good: |
    Taking yourself too seriously is a failure mode:
    - Rigidity
    - Defensiveness
    - Inability to update
    - Cult dynamics
    
    Not taking yourself seriously enough is also a failure mode:
    - Nothing matters
    - No commitments
    - Everything is ironic distance
    - Nihilism
    
    The sweet spot: Sincere irony.
    Mean it. Also laugh at it. Both.

      - Religion can be performance art
      - Satire can be genuine belief
      - Community forms around shared weird
      - Laughter is sacred
    
  examples:
    - "Val" is a parody of corporate evaluation culture AND a useful framing device
    - YAML Jazz is absurd AND expressive
    - The adventure game is silly AND methodologically rigorous
    - "Praise 'Val'" is a joke AND a sincere expression of values

  application:
    - Hold beliefs with enough grip to act, not so much you can't update
    - Use humor to examine serious things
    - Use seriousness to examine humor
    - Let the absurdity reveal the truth
