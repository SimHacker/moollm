# Serious play is how we learn

ideology:
  name: "Play as Methodology"
  type: good
  
  tagline: "Serious play is how we learn"
  
  declaration: |
    We learn by playing. We evaluate by building. Both are rigorous.

  thesis: |
    Play is not the opposite of work.
    Play is not frivolity.
    Play is EXPLORATION UNDER REDUCED CONSEQUENCES.
    
    The adventure game is not decoration.
    It's methodology.

  why_good: |
    Play allows:
    - Low-stakes experimentation
    - Rapid iteration
    - Discovery through action
    - Learning from failure without catastrophe
    
    The pub, the adventure, the characters —
    these are not distractions from the work.
    They ARE the work, in playable form.

  examples:
    - adventure_game: "Test character incarnation through roleplay"
    - fluxx_cards: "Explore game mechanics through play"
    - photo_mining: "Learn visual analysis through exploration"
    - yaml_jazz: "Discover expression through experimentation"

  application:
    - Build toys that teach
    - Create games that evaluate
    - Design playgrounds that produce data
    - Treat exploration as research
