# Ideology in the most mundane places

ideology:
  name: "Toilet Ideology"
  type: good  # It's GOOD because it REVEALS hidden ideology

  tagline: "Ideology is knee-deep in the lavatory"

  the_thesis: |
    "It is easy for an academic at a round table to claim that we live 
    in a post-ideological universe, but the moment he visits the lavatory 
    after the heated discussion, he is again knee-deep in ideology."

  the_full_written_quote: |
    "In a traditional German toilet, the hole into which shit disappears 
    after we flush is right at the front, so that shit is first laid out 
    for us to sniff and inspect for traces of illness. In the typical 
    French toilet, on the contrary, the hole is at the back, i.e. shit 
    is supposed to disappear as quickly as possible. Finally, the American 
    (Anglo-Saxon) toilet presents a synthesis, a mediation between these 
    opposites: the toilet basin is full of water, so that the shit floats 
    in it, visible, but not to be inspected. 
    
    [...] It is clear that none of these versions can be accounted for 
    in purely utilitarian terms: each involves a certain ideological 
    perception of how the subject should relate to excrement. 
    
    Hegel was among the first to see in the geographical triad of Germany, 
    France and England an expression of three different existential attitudes: 
    reflective thoroughness (German), revolutionary hastiness (French), 
    utilitarian pragmatism (English). In political terms, this triad can 
    be read as German conservatism, French revolutionary radicalism and 
    English liberalism. 
    
    [...] The point about toilets is that they enable us not only to 
    discern this triad in the most intimate domain, but also to identify 
    its underlying mechanism in the three different attitudes towards 
    excremental excess: an ambiguous contemplative fascination; a wish 
    to get rid of it as fast as possible; a pragmatic decision to treat 
    it as ordinary and dispose of it in an appropriate way. 
    
    It is easy for an academic at a round table to claim that we live 
    in a post-ideological universe, but the moment he visits the lavatory 
    after the heated discussion, he is again knee-deep in ideology."

  the_toilets:
    french:
      design: "Hole at the back"
      behavior: "Excrement disappears quickly"
      ideology: "Revolutionary hastiness"
      politics: "Revolutionary radicalism"
      attitude: "Get rid of it as fast as possible"
      metaphor: "Like a guillotine"
      
    german:
      design: "Shelf at the back, hole in front (the 'Flachspüler')"
      behavior: "Excrement displayed for inspection before flushing"
      ideology: "Reflective thoroughness"
      politics: "Conservatism"
      attitude: "Ambiguous contemplative fascination"
      metaphor: "Hermeneutic stool inschpection"

        "The German toilets, the old kind — now they are disappearing, 
        but you still find them. It's the opposite. The hole is in front, 
        so that when you produce exschrement, they are displayed in the back, 
        they don't disappear in water.
        
        This is the German ritual, you know? Use it every morning. 
        SCHNIFF, INSCHPECT your schits for traces of illness. 
        
        It's HIGH HERMENEUTIC. 
        
        I think the original meaning of Hermeneutic may be this."
      
    american:
      design: "Basin full of water"
      behavior: "Excrement floats, visible but not inspected"
      ideology: "Utilitarian pragmatism"
      politics: "Liberalism"
      attitude: "Pragmatic — treat it as ordinary, dispose appropriately"
      metaphor: "Let it float, be rational"

  the_point: |
    NONE of these designs can be explained in purely utilitarian terms.
    
    Each involves "a certain ideological perception of how the subject 
    should relate to excremental excess."
    
    The 18th century European trinity:
    - France: Politics, revolution, left
    - England: Economy, liberal, moderate
    - Germany: Metaphysics, poetry, conservative
    
    This triad appears IN THE TOILET BOWL.

  why_this_matters: |
    If ideology is embedded in TOILET DESIGN, then:
    
    1. Ideology is everywhere, especially where you don't look
    2. "Post-ideological" is itself an ideology
    3. The mundane is NEVER neutral
    4. Design choices are ALWAYS ideological choices
    5. Hermeneutics begins in the bathroom

  application_to_software: |
    If toilets encode ideology, so do:
    - Programming language syntax
    - IDE color schemes
    - Error message tone
    - Documentation style
    - API design
    - Default configurations
    
    The question is not WHETHER your code has ideology.
    The question is WHETHER YOU KNOW what ideology it has.

  the_hermeneutic_connection: |
    From Wikipedia:
    
    > Hermeneutics (/ˌhɜːrməˈnjuːtɪks/) is the theory and methodology 
    > of interpretation, especially the interpretation of biblical texts, 
    > wisdom literature, and philosophical texts. Hermeneutics is more 
    > than interpretive principles or methods we resort to when immediate 
    > comprehension fails. Rather, hermeneutics is the art of understanding 
    > and of making oneself understood.
    
    The German toilet shelf enables INTERPRETATION before disposal.
    You must ANALYZE before you flush.
    
    Code review is hermeneutic stool inschpection.
    
    Žižek suggests (with a twinkle): "I think the original meaning 
    of Hermeneutic for German may be this."
    
    (He's joking. But also not. Folk etymology places hermeneutics 
    with Hermes, the messenger god — interpreter, liar, thief, trickster.
    The German toilet shelf makes you interpret your own output before 
    sending it away.)

  don_hopkins_observation: |
    "That's why German toilets have a Hermeneutic stool inschpektion shelf: 
    So they have something to analyze then talk about all day."
    
    "According to Slavoj Žižek, Germans love Hermeneutic stool diagnostics."

  don_hopkins_corollary: |
    "An in-toilet shelf-cam paired with a mobile xitter app would be 
    the shit: a Hermeneutic tool for 'the art of understanding and 
    of making oneself understood'!"
