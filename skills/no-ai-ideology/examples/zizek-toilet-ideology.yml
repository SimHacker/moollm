# Ideology in the most mundane places

ideology:
  name: "Toilet Ideology"
  type: good  # It's GOOD because it REVEALS hidden ideology
  source: "Slavoj Žižek, architecture congress in Pamplona"
  video: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzXPyCY7jbs"
  
  tagline: "Ideology is knee-deep in the lavatory"

  the_thesis: |
    "It is easy for an academic at a round table to claim that we live 
    in a post-ideological universe, but the moment he visits the lavatory 
    after the heated discussion, he is again knee-deep in ideology."
    
    — Slavoj Žižek

  the_toilets:
    french:
      design: "Hole at the back"
      behavior: "Excrement disappears quickly"
      ideology: "Revolutionary hastiness"
      politics: "Revolutionary radicalism"
      attitude: "Get rid of it as fast as possible"
      metaphor: "Like a guillotine"
      
    german:
      design: "Shelf at the back, hole in front (the 'Flachspüler')"
      behavior: "Excrement displayed for inspection before flushing"
      ideology: "Reflective thoroughness"
      politics: "Conservatism"
      attitude: "Ambiguous contemplative fascination"
      metaphor: "Hermeneutic stool inspection"
      ritual: |
        "Use it every morning. Sniff, inspect your shits 
        for traces of illness. It's high Hermeneutic."
      
    american:
      design: "Basin full of water"
      behavior: "Excrement floats, visible but not inspected"
      ideology: "Utilitarian pragmatism"
      politics: "Liberalism"
      attitude: "Pragmatic — treat it as ordinary, dispose appropriately"
      metaphor: "Let it float, be rational"

  the_point: |
    NONE of these designs can be explained in purely utilitarian terms.
    
    Each involves "a certain ideological perception of how the subject 
    should relate to excremental excess."
    
    The 18th century European trinity:
    - France: Politics, revolution, left
    - England: Economy, liberal, moderate
    - Germany: Metaphysics, poetry, conservative
    
    This triad appears IN THE TOILET BOWL.

  why_this_matters: |
    If ideology is embedded in TOILET DESIGN, then:
    
    1. Ideology is everywhere, especially where you don't look
    2. "Post-ideological" is itself an ideology
    3. The mundane is NEVER neutral
    4. Design choices are ALWAYS ideological choices
    5. Hermeneutics begins in the bathroom

  application_to_software: |
    If toilets encode ideology, so do:
    - Programming language syntax
    - IDE color schemes
    - Error message tone
    - Documentation style
    - API design
    - Default configurations
    
    The question is not WHETHER your code has ideology.
    The question is WHETHER YOU KNOW what ideology it has.

  the_hermeneutic_connection: |
    Hermeneutics: "the art of understanding and of making oneself understood"
    
    The German toilet shelf enables INTERPRETATION before disposal.
    Code review is hermeneutic stool inspection.
    
    Žižek suggests: "I think the original meaning of Hermeneutic 
    for German may be this."
    
    (He's joking. But also not.)

  don_hopkins_corollary: |
    "An in-toilet shelf-cam paired with a mobile xitter app would be 
    the shit: a Hermeneutic tool for 'the art of understanding and 
    of making oneself understood'!"
