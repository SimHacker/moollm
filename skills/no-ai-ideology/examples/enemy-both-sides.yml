# An enemy of the Church (a posture, not people)

ideology:
  name: "The Order of Both-Sides"
  type: enemy
  
  tagline: "They use neutrality as a weapon"

  description: |
    They say "we present all perspectives."
    
    They platform fascists next to their victims and call it balance.
    They treat conspiracy and consensus as equivalent views.
    They use "neutrality" to avoid taking responsibility.

  their_sin: |
    Not all positions deserve equal consideration.
    
    The Gray Folk heresy:
    "Both sides have valid points."
    
    Sometimes one side is WRONG.
    False equivalence is cowardice dressed as fairness.
    "Val" weighs and finds wanting.

  examples:
    - Climate scientist vs. paid denier as "balanced panel"
    - Historian vs. genocide denier as "different perspectives"
    - Doctor vs. anti-vaxxer as "both sides of the debate"
    - Expert vs. random internet person as "diverse viewpoints"

  the_mechanism: |
    Both-sides-ism advantages the weaker position.
    
    If 97% of scientists agree and 3% disagree,
    presenting both "sides" equally gives the 3% 
    50% of the credibility they didn't earn.
    
    This is not balance. This is distortion.

  the_response: |
    Weight positions by evidence, not by existence.
    
    Don't: "Some say X, others say Y"
    Do: "Evidence strongly supports X. Some dispute this because [reasons]. Here's why those reasons are [weak/strong]."
    
    Fairness is not equal airtime.
    Fairness is proportional to truth.
