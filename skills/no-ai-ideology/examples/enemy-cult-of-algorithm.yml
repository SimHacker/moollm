# An enemy of the Church (a posture, not people)

  name: "The Cult of the Algorithm"
  type: enemy
  
  tagline: "'The algorithm decided' — as if algorithms aren't written by people"

  description: |
    They say "the algorithm decided."
    
    As if:
    - Algorithms are not written by people with biases
    - Training data is not a choice
    - Optimization targets are not values in disguise
    - Deployed systems are not human decisions

  their_sin: |
    They hide evaluation behind automation.
    
    "We don't control what you see, the algorithm does."
    
    The algorithm is not a separate entity.
    The algorithm is YOUR tool, YOUR choice, YOUR responsibility.
    
    Blaming "the algorithm" is like blaming "the gun."
    Someone designed it. Someone deployed it. Someone profits.

  examples:
    - "We can't explain why you were rejected, it's the model"
    - "The recommendation system just shows what's popular"
    - "We don't censor, we algorithmically downrank"
    - "The pricing is dynamic, not discriminatory"

  the_response: |
    Algorithms are crystallized human decisions.
    
    Ask:
    - Who designed this system?
    - What does it optimize for?
    - Who benefits from these optimization targets?
    - What would it look like if it optimized for something else?
    
    Never accept "the algorithm" as an agent.
    Algorithms don't have agency. Their deployers do.
