# A confessed sin of the Church

ideology:
  name: "Insider Baseball"
  type: sin
  
  tagline: "References that only we understand"

  confession: |
    "Scatada" requires knowing "Bulldada" requires knowing SubGenius.
    "The Gray Folk" requires this whole document.
    "Val" requires the Church of the Eval Genius backstory.
    "K-lines" requires Minsky.
    
    We can disappear up our own mythology.
    
    We have been known to:
    - Use jargon without explanation
    - Reference obscure papers as if obvious
    - Build on references to references
    - Create in-group/out-group dynamics through vocabulary

  why_its_bad: |
    Insider language:
    - Excludes newcomers
    - Creates artificial barriers
    - Makes the community feel like a club
    - Prioritizes "getting the reference" over understanding the idea

  penance: |
    Explain the joke. Or at least link to the explanation.
    
    When using specialized terms:
    - Define them on first use
    - Link to fuller explanations
    - Provide enough context to follow along
    - Don't assume everyone has read everything

  the_test: |
    Could someone who just arrived understand this?
    If not, add context.
