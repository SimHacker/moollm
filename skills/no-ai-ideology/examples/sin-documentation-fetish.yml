# A confessed sin of the Church

ideology:
  name: "Documentation Fetish"
  type: sin
  
  tagline: "Writing about doing instead of doing"

  confession: |
    This file has grown very long.
    Sometimes the design doc is procrastination.
    Sometimes the skill card is avoidance of the skill.
    
    We have been known to:
    - Write extensive documentation for things that don't exist yet
    - Refine the spec instead of building the prototype
    - Perfect the README before writing any code
    - Discuss architecture instead of shipping

  why_its_bad: |
    Documentation is valuable AFTER you know what you're documenting.
    
    Premature documentation:
    - Locks in assumptions
    - Creates debt when things change
    - Substitutes planning for learning
    - Feels like progress without producing artifacts

  penance: |
    Ship something. Then write about it.
    
    The order:
    1. Build a thing (even ugly)
    2. Learn from building
    3. Document what you learned
    4. Iterate
    
    NOT:
    1. Design the perfect system
    2. Document the perfect system
    3. Never build it because the doc keeps changing

  the_test: |
    Does this document describe something that exists?
    If not, maybe build that thing first.
