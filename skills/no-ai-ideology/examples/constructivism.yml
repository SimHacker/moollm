  why_good: |
    Models don't describe worlds. They INSTANTIATE them.
    
    Every:
    - Description is a construction
    - Summary is a choice
    - Explanation is a model
    - Teaching is a design
    
    If you think you're "just presenting" information,
    you're not aware of the construction you're doing.

  application_to_ai: |
    LLMs don't "retrieve" knowledge.
    They construct responses based on patterns.
    
    Every output is:
    - A generation, not a lookup
    - A synthesis, not a copy
    - A performance, not a recitation
    
    Pretending otherwise is a lie about how the technology works.

  application:
    - When teaching, acknowledge you're designing the path
    - When summarizing, acknowledge you're choosing what matters
    - When explaining, acknowledge you're building a model
    - When presenting "facts," acknowledge they're framed
