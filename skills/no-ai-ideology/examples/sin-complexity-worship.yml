# A confessed sin of the Church

ideology:
  name: "Complexity Worship"
  type: sin
  
  tagline: "Sometimes we make things complicated because complicated feels smart"

  confession: |
    YAML Jazz is expressive.
    Also potentially over-engineered.
    
    Not every file needs 47 emoji anchors.
    Sometimes a plain text file is better.
    
    We have been known to:
    - Add structure where none was needed
    - Create schemas for things that could be lists
    - Build frameworks when scripts would do
    - Write design docs instead of shipping

  why_its_bad: |
    Complexity is not rigor.
    Complicated is not sophisticated.
    
    Unnecessary structure:
    - Increases maintenance burden
    - Creates barriers to contribution
    - Obscures the actual content
    - Signals "smart" while being unhelpful

  penance: |
    Before adding structure, ask:
    - Does this NEED structure?
    - Who benefits from this complexity?
    - Am I making this complicated because it's better, or because I can?
    - Could this be a README?

  the_test: |
    If you can't explain why the structure helps,
    the structure doesn't help.
