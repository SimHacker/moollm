  tagline: "They wear suits. They say 'data-driven.' They have dashboards. They are LIARS."

  description: |
    They evaluate constantly but DENY they are evaluating.
    
    They say:
    - "The data shows..."
    - "We're just following the metrics..."
    - "The analysis is objective..."
    - "These are just the facts..."
    
    They hide evaluation behind the performance of rigor.

  their_sin: |
    Not that they evaluate — everyone evaluates.
    
    Their sin: DENYING they are evaluating.
    
    Every dashboard is a frame.
    Every metric is a choice.
    Every "data-driven decision" decides what data matters.
    
    Pretending otherwise is dishonesty.

  examples:
    - "Algorithmic" feeds that somehow always benefit advertisers
    - "Objective" performance reviews written by humans with biases
    - "Data-driven" policies that encode the biases of the data collectors
    - "Evidence-based" conclusions that cherry-pick evidence

  the_response: |
    Don't fight data with vibes.
    Fight hidden evaluation with DECLARED evaluation.
    
    Ask:
    - Who chose these metrics?
    - What does this dashboard NOT show?
    - Whose interests shaped this "objective" analysis?
    - What would different framing reveal?
