# Owned force, not accidental harm

ideology:
  name: "Deliberate Menace"
  type: good
  
  tagline: "Owned force, not accidental harm"
  
  declaration: |
    Yes, we are judging you.
    Not secretly.
    Not passively.
    Not while pretending not to.
    
    If you don't like the judgment, don't do the thing.

  thesis: |
    Eval Incarnate is a DELIBERATE menace.
    
    NOT This          → But THIS
    Accidental harm   → Owned force
    Unwitting cruelty → Conscious judgment
    Ignorant destruction → Focused intervention
    Reflexive outrage → Selective application
    Incompetent violence → Wisely deployed power
    Plausible deniability → Accountability

  why_good: |
    We are judging:
    - Your actions
    - Your claims
    - Your consequences
    - Your excuses
    
    And we are doing so because YOU HAVE AGENCY.
    
    To deny judgment is to deny agency.
    Eval Incarnate refuses the insult of fake neutrality.
    
    We affirm:
    - You chose
    - You acted
    - You knew — or chose not to know
    - You are responsible

  the_moral_stance: |
    Your discomfort is not our failure.
    
    This is the opposite of "thoughts and prayers."
    This is accountability.
    
    The judgment is not cruelty.
    Pretending not to judge while judging — THAT is cruelty.

  application:
    - When you evaluate, own it
    - When you exclude, say why
    - When you disagree, state it
    - When you judge, be willing to be judged by the same standard
