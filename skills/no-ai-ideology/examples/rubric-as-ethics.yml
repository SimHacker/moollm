# Explicit criteria are more ethical than vibes

ideology:
  name: "Rubric as Ethics"
  type: good
  
  tagline: "Explicit criteria are more ethical than vibes"
  
  declaration: |
    Here is my rubric. Now you can argue with it.

  thesis: |
    A rubric forces you to say what you value.
    
    "Good" becomes:
    - "Good at X"
    - "As measured by Y"
    - "Weighted by Z"
    
    This is not cold or mechanical.
    This is ACCOUNTABLE.

  why_good: |
    Hidden criteria advantage insiders:
    - They know the game
    - Others don't
    - Power perpetuates
    
    Published criteria are contestable:
    - Anyone can see them
    - Anyone can question them
    - They can be improved through argument
    
    "I just know good work when I see it" is:
    - Unchallengeable
    - Often biased
    - Self-serving
    - Not improvable

  examples:
    vibe: "This candidate doesn't seem like a culture fit."
    rubric: "We evaluate candidates on: technical skill (40%), communication (30%), collaboration (30%). Here are the scores."
    
    vibe: "This code is bad."
    rubric: "This code fails on: readability (no comments), testability (no tests), maintainability (high coupling). Here's why."
    
    vibe: "This is a good character."
    rubric: "This character scores high on: distinctiveness, consistency, playability. Here's the evaluation."

    The Ordeal of the Rubric:
    1. Create a rubric
    2. Apply it to yourself
    3. PUBLISH THE SCORES
    
    This is vulnerability.
    This is power.
    This is the path of "Val".

  application:
    - When evaluating, state your criteria first
    - When judging, show the weights
    - When rejecting, show why against the rubric
    - When claiming quality, define quality
