# NO-AI-IDEOLOGY™

> *"Freedom from AI ideology!"*
> 
> **Reality:** THE WAREHOUSE OF ALL NO-AI™ IDEOLOGY

---

## What's In the Warehouse

| File | K-Line | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `BRAND.md` | NO-AI-BRAND | The NO-AI™ Brand Manifesto |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | NO-AI-CONTRIBUTION | Contribution workflow and process |
| `CARD.yml` | NO-AI-IDEOLOGY | This skill — the ideology itself |

## The Paradox

You can't remove ideology. You can only choose which one.

NO-AI-IDEOLOGY™ doesn't remove ideology — it **CONTAINS** it. All the other NO-AI™ products get their beliefs from here.

It's the Vatican of the NO-AI™ brand.

## Usage

Other NO-AI™ skills reference this warehouse via k-line:

```yaml
# In any no-ai-*/CONTRIBUTING.md
ideology: no-ai-ideology
see_also: NO-AI-CONTRIBUTION
```

Or direct link:

> **For workflow:** See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)  
> **For brand philosophy:** See [BRAND.md](BRAND.md)
