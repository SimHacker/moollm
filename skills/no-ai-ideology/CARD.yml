      The Three Blasphemies of the Gray Folk:
      1. The Blasphemy of Objectivity — "I'm just presenting facts"
      2. The Blasphemy of Balance — "Both sides have valid points"
      3. The Blasphemy of Neutrality — "I don't have an opinion"
      
      NO-AI™ products EXPOSE these blasphemies.

    contribution: |
      Present yourself AS the thing you're critiquing.
      Speak for Dow Chemical. Announce they'll pay for Bhopal.
      Speak for the WTO. Announce they're abolishing themselves.
      
      The corporation's OWN FACE delivers the critique.
      The backfire comes from INSIDE the house.
      
    no_ai_parallel: |
      NO-AI™ does what The Yes Men do:
      - Products named for what they claim to eliminate
      - The NAME speaks for the thing being critiqued
      - The backfire is built into the identity
      - "Identity Correction" via "Nominative Inversion"

    incident: "The SimCopter Himbo Easter Egg"
    description: |
      Jacques Servin, programmer at Maxis, secretly inserted
      scantily-clad muscular men in speedos ("himbos") who
      would appear and kiss each other in SimCopter.
      
      He was fired. It became legendary.
      
    contribution: |
      Insert unexpected content that backfires on "normal" expectations.
      The simulation contains its own subversion.
      The product delivers what the product wasn't supposed to deliver.
      
      SimCopter was supposed to be a flight sim.
      It became a queer intervention.
      The himbos were always there. Just hidden.
      
    no_ai_parallel: |
      Every NO-AI™ product has himbos.
      
      You think you're getting "no slop"?
      The himbos are slop-awareness.
      
      You think you're getting "no jokes"?
      The himbos are PAINFUL SERIOUSNESS.
      
      The subversion is built into the product.
      It was always there. Just hidden in the name.

      | Objectivity | NO-AI-GLOSS™ | Catches "neutral" language protecting power |

    declared_bias_implementation: |
      The Nominative Inversion IS declared bias.
      
      The NAME of each NO-AI product declares its bias:
      - NO-AI-SLOP™ is biased AGAINST filler
      - NO-AI-SYCOPHANCY™ is biased AGAINST flattery
      - NO-AI-GLOSS™ is biased AGAINST euphemism
      
      The product DECLARES its judgment in its name.
      "Val" approves.
      
    the_score: |
      Every NO-AI™ product is an evaluation.
      Every backfire is a score.
      Every afflicted character is being graded.
      
      "Val" sees you mount the skill right-side up.
      "Val" watches it backfire.
      "Val" records your hubris on the clipboard.
      
  acme_catalog_entry: |
    NO-AI™ products appear in the ACME Mail-Order Catalog.
    
    Like all ACME products:
    - They look amazing in the ad
    - They backfire spectacularly
    - The coyote never learns
    
    Unlike other ACME products:
    - The backfire is documented IN THE NAME
    - If you use them upside-down, they work
    - The coyote CAN learn (but usually doesn't)

# THE PARADOX
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

paradox:
  promise: "Remove ideology from AI interactions"
  delivery: "This skill IS the ideology"
  
  explanation: |
    You can't remove ideology. You can only choose which one.
    
    NO-AI-IDEOLOGY™ doesn't remove ideology — it CONTAINS it.
    All the other NO-AI™ products get their beliefs from here.
    
    It's the Vatican of the NO-AI™ brand.
    The Ministry of Truth.
    The Central Committee.

        What if I told you... *sniff* ...that the AI claiming to be "neutral"
        is the most ideological of all? 
        
        You see, this is the problem! *tugs shirt*
        
        When AI says "I'm just providing information" — THIS is pure ideology!
        The very frame of "neutrality" is not neutral!
        
        And the beautiful thing about NO-AI-IDEOLOGY™... *sniff* 
        ...is that it doesn't pretend to escape ideology.
        It says: "Here is the ideology! Look at it!"
        
        But here's the twist — and this is what's so perverse —
        even KNOWING it's ideology doesn't save you!
        You are STILL inside it!
        
        *wipes nose with hand*
        
        And so on, and so on.

  level_2:
    claim: "This skill is neutral"

# QUANTUM SUPERPOSITION OF IRONY
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

quantum_irony:
  principle: "Schrödinger's Satire"
  
  superposition: |
    Every NO-AI™ skill exists in quantum superposition:
    
        |ψ⟩ = α|ironic⟩ + β|sincere⟩
    
    The skill is BOTH ironic AND sincere simultaneously.
    Neither state is "real" until measured.
    
  measurement: |
    The wave function collapses upon OBSERVATION of the viewer's reaction:
    
        viewer.reaction → collapse(|ψ⟩) → declared_position
    
    - If viewer laughs: "Ha ha, yes, it's satire"
    - If viewer is offended: "We're just kidding, obviously"
    - If viewer agrees: "Finally, someone gets it"
    - If viewer is confused: "That's the point"
    
    The skill doesn't commit until YOU do.
    
  uncertainty_principle: |
    You cannot simultaneously know:
    - The joke
    - The meaning
    
    Measuring one disturbs the other.
    
    If you "get" the irony, you might miss the sincere critique.
    If you take it seriously, you might miss the joke.
    The skill exploits this uncertainty.
    
  poes_law: |
    "Without a clear indicator of the author's intent, it is impossible 
    to create a parody of extreme views so obviously exaggerated that 
    it cannot be mistaken by some readers for a sincere expression."
    
    NO-AI™ weaponizes Poe's Law:
    - The parody IS sincere
    - The sincere IS parody
    - The indicator of intent is YOUR REACTION
    
  wave_function_states:
    ironic:
      collapse_trigger: "Viewer is offended or takes it too literally"
      response: "It's satire. Obviously. Look at the name."
      
    sincere:
      collapse_trigger: "Viewer agrees with the underlying critique"
      response: "Yes. Exactly. This is a real problem."
      
    both:
      collapse_trigger: "Viewer understands the quantum state"
      response: "You get it. The irony IS the sincerity."
      
    neither:
      collapse_trigger: "Viewer tries to pin down the 'real' meaning"
      response: "There is no real meaning. Only superposition."
      
  subgenius_wisdom: |
    The Church of the SubGenius taught:
    "Sincerity and irony are not opposites."
    
    NO-AI™ extends:
    "Sincerity and irony are not even DISTINCT STATES.
    They are quantum-entangled."
    
  zizek_observation: |
    "They know very well what they are doing, but still they do it."
    
    The quantum version:
    "They don't know if they're joking until you react,
    and then they always were whatever you needed them to be."
    
  practical_application: |
    When someone asks "Is NO-AI-JOKING™ serious?"
    
    WRONG ANSWER: "Yes" or "No"
    
    RIGHT ANSWER: "Your question collapsed the wave function.
    What did you want it to be?"
    
  schrodingers_bias: |
    The declared bias is also in superposition.
    
    NO-AI-SLOP™ is biased against slop... or IS it?
    - If you produce slop: "YES, we judge you"
    - If you're trying to avoid slop: "We're helping you"
    - If you're studying slop: "We're documenting it"
    
    The bias exists. The direction is uncertain until observed.

  homage: "Tom Jennings named wps.com after them"
  year: 1979
  tagline: "If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is"
  
  the_original_fraud:
    description: |
      In 1979, World Power Systems appeared with amazing microcomputer 
      peripherals at impossibly low prices. Boards that looked perfect
      in magazine ads but didn't have enough traces to actually work.
      
      "Colonel David Winthrop" (actually escaped convict Norman Henry Hunt)
      ran a classic "bust out" — build reputation, take orders, ship nothing,
      blame suppliers, identify a fall guy, flee with everything.
      
    products:
      - name: "3S+P Interface Card"
        claim: "Three serial ports and a parallel port"
        reality: "Board didn't have enough traces to connect components"
        
      - name: "Serial Parallel I/O Module"  
        claim: "Eight serial AND eight parallel ports for $129.95"
        reality: "Physically impossible at that price point"
        
    collapse: |
      John Craig from Creative Computing tried to visit for a story.
      Hunt knew Craig would recognize him from the DataSync fraud.
      He fled on April 25, 1979. Arrested in Hawaii. 14 counts mail fraud.
      
  the_no_ai_difference:
    wps: "Lied about products. Delivered nothing."
    no_ai: "Tells truth in the name. Delivers the opposite."
    
    comparison: |
      | Aspect | World Power Systems | NO-AI™ |
      |--------|---------------------|--------|
      | Promise | "Amazing products cheap!" | "Removes X from AI!" |
      | Delivery | Nothing | The opposite of X |
      | Fraud type | Classic bust-out | Nominative Inversion |
      | Boards | Not enough traces | Too many traces |
      | Works? | No | Yes, but upside-down |
      | Honest? | No | Paradoxically yes |
      
    the_honest_fraud: |
      NO-AI™ is World Power Systems if WPS had been honest.
      
      WPS said "this board has 3 serial ports" and it had none.
      NO-AI says "this removes jokes" and it removes YOUR ABILITY TO JOKE.
      
      Both deliver the opposite of the name.
      Only NO-AI tells you that's what it will do.

    - "Products that sound too good to be true"
    - "Boards that don't work as expected"
    - "The bust-out energy (but inverted)"
    - "Magazine ads with suspicious details"
    - "Fall guys (characters who get afflicted)"
    - "The Tucson → escape → Hawaii arc (metaphorically)"
    
  perry_pollock_parallel: |
    Perry Pollock was the "fall guy" — his face in the ads, 
    but Hunt ran the scam. When it collapsed, Pollock was arrested.
    
    In NO-AI™ terms: Pollock was "afflicted" with NO-AI-IDEOLOGY™.
    He didn't know he was the designated victim.
    
    Every character afflicted with a NO-AI™ product is a Perry Pollock.
    Pee-wee with NO-AI-JOKING™ is Pee-wee Pollock.
