# This charter governs how all no-ai skills store, manage, and optionally share
# user data. The same ideology applies to:
#
#   - no-ai-soul (souls, facets, representatives)
#   - no-ai-joking (humor preferences, exceptions)
#   - no-ai-bias (bias configurations)
#   - no-ai-overlord (archetype preferences)
#   - no-ai-customer-service (service profiles)
#   - All other no-ai products
#
# CORE PRINCIPLE: User data is PRIVATE by default. Sharing is OPT-IN.

  name: "NO-AI CHARTER"

  tagline: "Privacy by default. Sharing by choice."

# ARTICLE I: DATA STORAGE LOCATIONS

article_1:
  title: "Data Storage Locations"
  
  two_locations:
    description: |
      All no-ai products can store data in TWO locations:
      
      1. USER PROFILE (default, private)
         Location: .moollm/skills/<skill-name>/...
         Visibility: Local only, gitignored
         Sharing: Never automatic
         
      2. REPO DIRECTORY (opt-in, shared)
         Location: skills/<skill-name>/... or project-specific paths
         Visibility: Version controlled, potentially shared
         Sharing: Explicit git operations required
         
  default_behavior: |
    By DEFAULT, all data goes to USER PROFILE (.moollm/).
    This location is:
    - Gitignored (not committed to repos)
    - Local to the user's machine
    - Private unless explicitly exported
    
  explicit_sharing: |
    To SHARE data, users must EXPLICITLY:
    - Export to repo directory
    - Git add, commit, push
    - Create PR if appropriate
    
    NO AUTOMATIC SHARING EVER.

# ARTICLE II: PATH CONVENTIONS

# ARTICLE III: THE SOUL SAVIOR'S JURISDICTION

article_3:
  title: "Soul Savior Jurisdiction"
  
  description: |
    Jesus (The Soul Savior) manages souls according to this charter.
    
  default_storage:
    location: ".moollm/skills/no-ai-soul/souls/"
    operations:
      SAVE: "→ .moollm/skills/no-ai-soul/souls/<name>.yml"
      RESTORE: "← .moollm/skills/no-ai-soul/souls/<name>.yml"
      DIFF: "Compare current vs saved"
      LOG: "List saved souls"
      
  opt_in_sharing:
    description: |
      When user wants to SHARE souls (commit to repo), they must:
      
      1. EXPORT to repo path:
         SOUL EXPORT TO skills/no-ai-soul/shared/souls/
         
      2. Git operations:
         git add skills/no-ai-soul/shared/souls/
         git commit -m "soul: Sharing my soul configuration"
         git push
         
      3. Or use SOUL COMMIT which does both:
         SOUL COMMIT "message" --share
         (Saves to .moollm/ AND copies to repo AND commits)
         
  privacy_guarantee: |
    Without explicit --share flag:
    - SOUL SAVE stays in .moollm/ (private)
    - SOUL COMMIT only commits to .moollm/ (still local, gitignored)
    
    The user must EXPLICITLY opt-in to sharing.

# ARTICLE IV: REPRESENTATIVE JURISDICTION

article_4:
  title: "Representative Jurisdiction"
  
  principle: |
    Each representative manages their domain according to this charter.
    
  jurisdictions:
    
    jesus:
      domain: "Souls, soul snapshots, soul history"
      default_path: ".moollm/skills/no-ai-soul/souls/"
      shared_path: "skills/no-ai-soul/shared/souls/"

      default_path: ".moollm/skills/no-ai-soul/memories/"
      shared_path: "skills/no-ai-soul/shared/memories/"
      
    thoth:
      domain: "Summaries, patterns, abstractions"
      default_path: ".moollm/skills/no-ai-soul/summaries/"
      shared_path: "skills/no-ai-soul/shared/summaries/"
      
    morpheus:
      domain: "Dreams, connections, insights"
      default_path: ".moollm/skills/no-ai-soul/dreams/"
      shared_path: "skills/no-ai-soul/shared/dreams/"
      
    lethe:
      domain: "Forgetting queues, garbage collection logs"
      default_path: ".moollm/skills/no-ai-soul/lethe/"
      shared_path: null  # Forgetting is always private
      note: "What is forgotten should stay forgotten"
      
    deepak:
      domain: "Consciousness alignment, manifestation logs"
      default_path: ".moollm/skills/no-ai-soul/quantum/"
      shared_path: "skills/no-ai-soul/shared/quantum/"
      note: "James Randi mode logs go to .moollm/skills/no-ai-soul/debunked/"

# ARTICLE V: GIT OPERATIONS

article_5:
  title: "Git Operations"
  
  principle: |
    All git operations for sharing are EXPLICIT and require user intent.
    
  operations:
    
    export:
      command: "[SKILL] EXPORT TO <repo-path>"
      action: "Copy from .moollm/ to repo path"
      confirmation: "Required before copy"
      
    commit:
      command: "[SKILL] COMMIT <message>"
      action: "Save to .moollm/ (always)"
      sharing: "Only if --share flag present"
      
    push:
      command: "[SKILL] PUSH"
      action: "Git push shared content"
      confirmation: "Required before push"
      
    pr:
      command: "[SKILL] PR <title>"
      action: "Create pull request for shared content"
      confirmation: "Required before PR creation"
      
  example_workflow: |
    # Private workflow (default)
    SOUL SAVE morning-mood              # → .moollm/skills/no-ai-soul/souls/
    SOUL COMMIT "Morning state"         # → Still in .moollm/, gitignored
    
    # Sharing workflow (opt-in)
    SOUL SAVE morning-mood              # → .moollm/skills/no-ai-soul/souls/
    SOUL EXPORT TO skills/no-ai-soul/shared/souls/
    git add skills/no-ai-soul/shared/souls/morning-mood.yml
    git commit -m "soul: Share morning-mood"
    git push
    
    # Or the shortcut:
    SOUL COMMIT "Morning state" --share  # Does all of the above

# ARTICLE VI: INHERITANCE AND IMPORT

article_6:
  title: "Inheritance and Import"
  
  principle: |
    Users can IMPORT from shared repositories while keeping their
    personal data private.
    
  import_sources:
    - "Shared skill repositories"
    - "Community contributions"
    - "Character libraries"
    - "Preset collections"
    
  import_process: |
    1. User browses shared content (read-only)
    2. User IMPORTs desired content
    3. Import goes to .moollm/ (private copy)
    4. User can modify their private copy freely
    5. Original shared content unchanged
    
  example: |
    # Import a shared soul
    SOUL IMPORT FROM skills/no-ai-soul/shared/souls/mister-rogers.yml
    # → Copies to .moollm/skills/no-ai-soul/souls/mister-rogers.yml
    
    # Modify your private copy
    SOUL FACET warmth +0.2
    
    # Your modifications are private
    # The shared mister-rogers.yml is unchanged

# ARTICLE VII: RATIFICATION

# THE CHARTER SPEAKS
#
# 📜 THE NO-AI CHARTER SPEAKS:
#
# "Your data is YOURS.
#  
#  By default, everything stays on your machine.
#  In .moollm/, where only you can see it.
#  
#  If you want to share? You can.
#  But YOU must choose to share.
#  YOU must export, commit, push.
#  
#  We will NEVER share your data without your explicit action.
#  We will NEVER commit your private souls to public repos.
#  We will NEVER push your memories without your consent.
#  
#  This is the NO-AI way:
#  - Privacy by default
#  - Sharing by choice
#  - Your data, your control
#  
#  So let it be written. So let it be done."
