# 🧠 "Context → Action → Result"

what: |
  Drescher's computational theory of causal learning.
  Schemas: Context → Action → Result units.
  Discovered through experience.

why: |
  - Understand how minds learn causality
  - Discover prerequisites
  - Chain schemas for planning
  - Foundation for MOOLLM learning

when:
  - "Understanding action success/failure" → MARGINAL-ATTRIBUTION
  - "Unreliable schema" → SYNTHESIZE-ITEM
  - "Planning chain of actions" → PLAN-DIJKSTRA

methods:
  MARGINAL_ATTRIBUTION: "Track correlations with success/failure"
  SPIN_OFF: "Create child schema with new context"
  SYNTHESIZE_ITEM: "Invent hidden state hypothesis"
  PLAN_DIJKSTRA: "Shortest schema path to goal"

state: |
  items: ON/OFF/UNKNOWN states
  schemas: Discovered schemas
  extended_context: Statistical tables
  extended_results: Statistical tables

moollm_extensions:
  symbol_grounding: "Items mean something"
  causal_reasoning: "Why patterns hold"
  natural_explanation: "Communicate discoveries"
