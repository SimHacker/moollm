# Skill Snitch Report: schema-mechanism

**Date:** 2026-01-28  
**Auditor:** Deep Probe  
**Verdict:** CONTEXT → ACTION → RESULT

---

## Executive Summary

**Drescher's computational theory of causal learning.**

Schemas are Context → Action → Result units discovered through experience.

Extended by MOOLLM with LLM semantic understanding.

---

## The Lineage

```
Piaget → Minsky → Drescher → MOOLLM
```

---

## Methods

| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **MARGINAL-ATTRIBUTION** | Track which items correlate with success/failure |
| **SPIN-OFF** | Create refined child schema with discovered context |
| **SYNTHESIZE-ITEM** | Invent hidden state hypothesis |
| **PLAN-DIJKSTRA** | Find shortest schema path to goal |

---

## State

```yaml
items: "ON/OFF/UNKNOWN states"
schemas: "Discovered schemas"
extended_context: "Statistical tables for context"
extended_results: "Statistical tables for results"
```

---

## MOOLLM Extensions

| Extension | What It Adds |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Symbol grounding** | Items mean something |
| **Causal reasoning** | Why patterns hold |
| **Natural explanation** | Communicate discoveries |

---

## Security Assessment

### Concerns

None. It's foundational theory.

**Risk Level:** ZERO — pure epistemology

| **Marvin Minsky** | Society of Mind (1986) |
| **Jean Piaget** | Genetic Epistemology |
| **Henry Minsky** | pyleela.brain implementation |

## Verdict

**COMPUTATIONAL EPISTEMOLOGY. APPROVE.**

Context → Action → Result.

How minds learn causality.
