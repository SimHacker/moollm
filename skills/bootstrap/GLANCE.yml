# 🌅 "Wake up, orient, warm the context."

what: |
  First skill to invoke at session start.
  Probes environment, detects platform driver, warms context,
  delegates to adventure or other startup mode.

why: |
  - Start sessions with proper orientation
  - Load context in priority order (critical → high → medium)
  - Detect platform (Cursor, Claude Code, custom)
  - Recover from cold context or confusion

when:
  - Session start → BOOTSTRAP
  - "What am I?" → SELF-DESCRIBE
  - Context feels cold → WARM-CONTEXT
  - Boot seems broken → DEBUG-BOOT

sequence: PROBE → DETECT-DRIVER → SETUP → WARM-CONTEXT → STARTUP

methods:
  BOOTSTRAP: "Full sequence (can skip startup with --no-startup)"
  PROBE: "Gather environment WITHOUT terminal commands"
  DEEP-PROBE: "Extended diagnostics WITH terminal commands"
  CURSOR-PROBE: "Deep Cursor introspection via cursor-mirror"
  WARM-CONTEXT: "Load files by priority (critical/high/medium/all)"
  REFLECT: "Analyze past sessions for self-improvement"
