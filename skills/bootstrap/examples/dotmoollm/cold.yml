  - skills/INDEX.yml                      # Using INDEX.md instead (denser)
  
  # Large files to avoid loading fully
  - "**/*-full-scan.yml"                  # Security scans are huge
  - "**/*-transcript.md"                  # Session transcripts are long
  - "designs/raw-chats/**/*"              # Raw chat transcripts are long
