# MOOLLM hot list (advisory for Cursor)
# Updated: 2026-01-28 - INDEX.md primary, semantic mipmap optimized
# 
# This file tells Cursor what to prioritize loading.
# It's advisory — hints, not commands.

priority:
  critical:
    # ALWAYS load these first
    - skills/INDEX.md                     # Know what skills exist (denser than YAML)
    - skills/bootstrap/CARD.yml           # Bootstrap interface
    - kernel/drivers/cursor.yml           # Platform behavior
    
  high:
    # Skills BEFORE content (understand how to interpret)
    - skills/adventure/CARD.yml           # Game mechanics
    - skills/character/CARD.yml           # Character pattern
    - skills/incarnation/CARD.yml         # How characters work
    - skills/room/CARD.yml                # Room pattern
    
  medium:
    # GLANCEs for quick orientation (not full files!)
    - examples/adventure-4/characters/animals/monkey-palm/GLANCE.yml  # 60 lines
    - examples/adventure-4/pub/GLANCE.yml                              # 70 lines
    
  low:
    # Full files only when needed
    - examples/adventure-4/characters/animals/monkey-palm/CHARACTER.yml  # 941 lines - load on demand
    - examples/adventure-4/pub/ROOM.yml                                   # 930 lines - load on demand

notes:
  - "Cursor advisory mode: these are hints, not commands"
  - "INDEX.md is primary (1,700 words covers 117 skills)"
  - "Pattern: INDEX.md → CARD.yml → GLANCE.yml → full files"
  - "GLANCEs reduce boot overhead by ~93%"
  - "See .moollm/bootstrap-probe.yml for mipmap metrics"
