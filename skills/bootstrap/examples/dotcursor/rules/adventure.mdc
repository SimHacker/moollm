# Adventure Mode

When working in `examples/` you're in the adventure world.

## Boot Sequence for Characters

1. `skills/adventure/CARD.yml` — Game mechanics
2. `skills/character/CARD.yml` — Character pattern  
3. `skills/incarnation/CARD.yml` — How characters work
4. `skills/room/CARD.yml` — Directory = room pattern
5. THEN: The specific `CHARACTER.yml` and `ROOM.yml`

Never read giant CHARACTER/ROOM files without first reading the skills that interpret them!

## Key Protocols

- `ADVENTURE` — Room-based exploration
- `INCARNATE` — Create/become a character
- `SPEED-OF-LIGHT` — Simulate many turns in one call
- `REPRESENTATION-ETHICS` — Ethics of simulating people

## GLANCE Files — Wide-Angle Views

ALL 45 characters have GLANCE.yml files. Always check for GLANCE first.

GLANCEs are NOT just file summaries — they're **wide-angle views** of entire directories:
- Character identity AND subdirectories (selfies/, sessions/, artifacts/)
- Room atmosphere AND all items it contains
- What's IN there, not just what the main file says

| Directory | GLANCE Shows |
|-----------|--------------|
| `don-hopkins/` | CHARACTER + fmc-898/ + dreams/ + selfies/ + sessions/ |
| `richard-bartle/` | CHARACTER + artifacts/ + pets/ + study/ + sessions/ |
| `pub/` | ROOM + arcade/ + bar/ + basement/ + stage/ + rooftop/ |

**Pattern**: Before reading ANY directory, check for GLANCE.yml — it advertises everything inside.

## Available Characters

| Character | Species | Location | Role |
|-----------|---------|----------|------|
| Palm | Monkey | pub/bar | Philosopher, former jade amulet |
| Don Hopkins | Human | visitor | Godfather, MOOLLM creator |
| Richard Bartle | Human | pub | MUD pioneer |
| Donna Toadstool | Fungal | garden | Mycological wisdom |
| Grue | Monster | basement | Lurks in darkness |
| Wumpus Snorax | Hybrid | caves | Environmental |
| Bartender | NPC | pub/bar | Knows secrets |

## Available Rooms

| Room | Type | Key Features |
|------|------|--------------|
| The Gezelligheid Grotto | Pub | Cats, conversation, gezelligheid |
| Bar | Service | Drinks, Palm's spot, bartender |
| Stage | Performance | Pee-wee performs here |
| Basement | Storage | Ale barrels, darkness, grue? |
| Lane Neverending | Street | Shops, manufacturing, tower |
| Leela Manufacturing | Factory | Floors 1-5, rooftop telescope |
| NO AI Tower | Corporate | Embassy in basement |

## Deep Optimization (Permission Required)

To optimize adventure boot, I can analyze:
- Which CHARACTER.yml sections are actually used
- Room navigation patterns (what paths are common?)
- File load order optimization

**Ask:** "Optimize adventure boot" or "Analyze adventure patterns"

### Analysis Commands

```bash
# With permission, run:
python3 skills/cursor-mirror/scripts/cursor_mirror.py tools @1 | grep -E "CHARACTER|ROOM"
python3 skills/cursor-mirror/scripts/cursor_mirror.py context-sources @1 --filter examples/
```

### Recent Findings (Example)

Most-visited rooms (this session):
1. pub/ (12 visits)
2. pub/bar/ (8 visits)
3. street/lane-neverending/ (6 visits)

Most-loaded characters:
1. Palm (5 loads, GLANCE only)
2. Bartender (3 loads)
3. Don Hopkins (2 loads)

### Suggested Optimizations

Based on actual usage:
- ✓ GLANCE.yml versions exist for large files
- ✓ hot.yml prioritizes adventure/CARD.yml
- ✓ Skill CARDs loaded before content
- Consider: Pre-loading pub/GLANCE.yml in hot.yml (frequently visited)
