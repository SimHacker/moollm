# startup.yml — Post-Boot Startup Hook
#
# What happens after BOOT completes?
# This template configures the default startup behavior.
#
# COPY TO: .moollm/startup.yml or repo root startup.yml
# Then customize for your workflow.
#
# INVOCATION CHAIN:
#   BOOT → PROBE → DETECT-DRIVER → WARM-CONTEXT → SELF-DESCRIBE → STARTUP
#
# OVERRIDE: .moollm/startup.yml takes precedence over root startup.yml
