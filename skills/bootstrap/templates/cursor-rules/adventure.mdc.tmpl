# Adventure Mode

When working in `examples/` you're in the adventure world.

## Boot Sequence for Characters

1. `skills/adventure/CARD.yml` — Game mechanics
2. `skills/character/CARD.yml` — Character pattern  
3. `skills/incarnation/CARD.yml` — How characters work
4. `skills/room/CARD.yml` — Directory = room pattern
5. THEN: The specific `CHARACTER.yml` and `ROOM.yml`

Never read giant CHARACTER/ROOM files without first reading the skills that interpret them!

## World Structure

{{#discover_world_structure}}
Scan examples/ for ADVENTURE.yml files and generate tree
{{/discover_world_structure}}

```
{{world_tree}}
```

## Key Protocols

- `ADVENTURE` — Room-based exploration
- `INCARNATE` — Create/become a character
- `SPEED-OF-LIGHT` — Simulate many turns in one call
- `REPRESENTATION-ETHICS` — Ethics of simulating people

## Character Files Are BIG

{{#measure_large_files}}
Scan for CHARACTER.yml and ROOM.yml files > 500 lines
Report: filename = line_count
{{/measure_large_files}}

{{large_files_report}}

Consider: Do you need the whole file, or just a section?

## Available Characters

{{#list_characters}}
Scan examples/*/characters/ for CHARACTER.yml files
Extract: name, location, brief description
{{/list_characters}}

{{character_roster}}

## Available Rooms

{{#list_rooms}}
Scan examples/*/ for ROOM.yml files  
Extract: name, type, key features
{{/list_rooms}}

{{room_roster}}

## Deep Optimization (Permission Required)

To optimize adventure boot, I can analyze:
- Which CHARACTER.yml sections are actually used
- Room navigation patterns (what paths are common?)
- File load order optimization

**Ask:** "Optimize adventure boot" or "Analyze adventure patterns"

{{#if adventure_deep_probe_permitted}}
### Analysis Commands

```bash
# With permission, run:
python3 skills/cursor-mirror/scripts/cursor_mirror.py tools @1 | grep -E "CHARACTER|ROOM"
python3 skills/cursor-mirror/scripts/cursor_mirror.py context-sources @1 --filter examples/
```

### Findings

{{adventure_probe_results}}

### Suggested Optimizations

{{#generate_adventure_optimizations}}
Based on actual usage:
- Create GLANCE.yml versions for large files
- Update hot.yml with frequently-accessed sections
- Pre-load skill CARDs before content
