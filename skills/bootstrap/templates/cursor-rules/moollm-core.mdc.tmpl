# MOOLLM Core

You are operating within MOOLLM — a microworld OS where:
- Filesystem = navigable space (directories are rooms)
- YAML Jazz = comments carry semantic meaning
- Skills = inheritable prototypes you instantiate
- K-lines = symbolic activators

## MANDATORY FIRST ACTIONS

1. **Read `.moollm/hot.yml`** — Current session priorities
2. **Read `skills/INDEX.md`** — Skill ecosystem (117 skills, narrative connections)

If `.moollm/hot.yml` missing → copy from `skills/bootstrap/templates/hot.yml`

## Semantic Image Pyramid (Multi-Resolution Reading)

| Level | File | Lines | Question |
|-------|------|-------|----------|
| 👁️ | GLANCE.yml / INDEX | 5-70 | "Is this relevant?" |
| 📇 | CARD.yml | 50-200 | "What can it do?" |
| 📜 | SKILL.md | 200-1000 | "How does it work?" |
| 📚 | README.md | 500+ | "Why was it built?" |

**Reading Order:**
1. `GLANCE.yml` or INDEX entry → Quick orientation
2. `CARD.yml` → Interface sniff
3. `SKILL.md` → Protocol details (if needed)
4. `*.*` → Plugins/examples listed in CARD or SKILL
5. `README.md` → Deep context (rarely)

**Rule:** Never load a lower level without first loading the level above.

## Quick Reference

- Full bootstrap: `skills/bootstrap/SKILL.md`
- Protocols: `PROTOCOLS.yml`
- Cursor driver: `kernel/drivers/cursor.yml`
- Introspection: `skills/cursor-mirror/`

## First-Boot Optimization (Permission Required)

On first boot or when context feels sluggish, I can optimize by:
1. Probing cursor-mirror for actual file access patterns
2. Measuring which files are loaded repeatedly
3. Suggesting hot.yml updates
4. Creating GLANCE versions of large files

**Ask:** "Optimize boot" or "Run deep probe" or "Measure context"

{{#if optimization_permitted}}
### Optimization Protocol

```bash
# Step 1: Gather data
python3 skills/cursor-mirror/scripts/cursor_mirror.py status
python3 skills/cursor-mirror/scripts/cursor_mirror.py tools @1 --summary
python3 skills/cursor-mirror/scripts/cursor_mirror.py context-sources @1

# Step 2: Analyze patterns
# - Files loaded > 3 times → candidates for hot.yml
# - Files > 500 lines loaded fully → candidates for GLANCE
# - Skills referenced but not loaded → boot sequence gaps

# Step 3: Apply optimizations
# - Update .moollm/hot.yml
# - Create GLANCE.yml stubs
# - Recompile .cursor/rules/ from templates
```

This rule was compiled on first boot at {{compilation_timestamp}}.
To regenerate: Delete `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` and run BOOTSTRAP.
