# MOOLLM hot list template (advisory for Cursor)
# Copy to .moollm/hot.yml and customize for your session

priority:
  critical:
    # ALWAYS load these first
    - skills/INDEX.md                     # Know what skills exist (denser than YAML)
    - skills/bootstrap/CARD.yml           # Bootstrap interface
    - kernel/drivers/cursor.yml           # Platform behavior
    
  high:
    # Load skill CARDs BEFORE content files
    # Customize based on what you're doing:
    # - skills/adventure/CARD.yml         # For adventure play
    # - skills/character/CARD.yml         # For character work
    # - skills/cursor-mirror/CARD.yml     # For introspection
    
  medium:
    # GLANCEs for quick orientation (prefer over full files)
    # Add GLANCE.yml paths here for entities you're working with
    
  low:
    # Full files - load on demand only
    # CHARACTER.yml, ROOM.yml, etc. go here

notes:
  - "Cursor advisory mode: these are hints, not commands"
  - "Pattern: INDEX.md → skill CARDs → GLANCEs → full files"
  - "Run 'Optimize boot' to let cursor-mirror suggest improvements"
  - "GLANCEs reduce boot overhead by ~90%"
