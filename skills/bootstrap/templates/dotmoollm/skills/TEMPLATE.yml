# SKILL USER PROFILE TEMPLATE
#
# LOCATION: Copy to .moollm/skills/<skill-name>/config.yml
#
# User profiles override skill defaults. Skills read this to configure
# per-user behavior without requiring changes to skill source code.
#
# OVERRIDE HIERARCHY (lowest to highest priority):
#
#   1. SKILL DEFAULTS     skills/<skill-name>/defaults.yml
#   2. PROJECT PROFILE    .moollm/skills/<skill-name>/config.yml  <- THIS
#   3. USER GLOBAL        ~/.moollm/skills/<skill-name>/config.yml
#   4. ENVIRONMENT        MOOLLM_<SKILL>_<SETTING>=value
#   5. COMMAND LINE       --setting value
#
# HOW TO USE:
#   1. Copy to .moollm/skills/<skill-name>/config.yml
#   2. Uncomment what you need
#   3. Delete what you don't
#
# POSTEL'S LAW: Skills should be liberal in what they accept.
# Old fields still work. New fields ignored if unknown.
# No version numbers — just evolve the schema gracefully.

# AUTHENTICATION
# Never commit secrets — use references or env vars.
