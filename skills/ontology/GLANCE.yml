# 🏷️ "Tags, not trees — composable being-types"

what: |
  Composable ontological tags for character identity.
  Tags, not trees. Folksonomy, not taxonomy.
  Characters can have multiple tags. Most restrictive ethics win.

why: |
  - Multiple identities compose
  - Ethics from all tags apply
  - Flexible identity modeling
  - Ethical constraints automatic

when:
  - '"Creating character" → inherit from tag skills'
  - '"Determining ethics" → CHECK-ETHICS'
  - '"Composing identity" → COMPOSE'

tags:
  real_being: "👤 Actually exists — highest ethical weight"
  historical: "📜 Deceased real being"
  fictional: "📖 Invented — creative freedom"
  animal: "🐾 Non-human creature"
  robot: "🤖 Artificial being"
  abstract: "💭 Concept personified"
  mythic: "✨ Mythology/folklore"

tagging_mechanism: |
  Characters inherit from ontological skills to get tagged.
  Multiple inheritance = multiple tags.
  Each tag IS a skill.

composition_rule: "Most restrictive ethics apply"

common_combinations:
  real_animal: "[real-being, animal] → full respect + species-appropriate"
  fictional_robot: "[fictional, robot] → creative freedom + robotic"
  ai_trained_on_real: "[real-being, robot, fictional] → consent + AI disclosure"
  real_inspired: "[real-being, fictional] → HERO-STORY required"

methods:
  TAG: "Assign ontological tags"
  CHECK_ETHICS: "Compute combined ethics"
  COMPOSE: "Combine multiple sources"
