# CARD.yml — Ontology
#
# Composable ontological tags for character identity.
# Tags, not trees. Folksonomy, not taxonomy.
# "What kind of being is this?"

  description: |
    Ontological tags declare what kind of being a character IS.
    Characters can have multiple tags — a real dog is both
    [real-person, animal]. An AI trained on someone's writing
    is [real-person, robot, fictional].
    
    Each tag carries ethical implications. When composed,
    the most restrictive ethics win.

# THE ONTOLOGICAL TAGS
# Each tag IS a skill. Skills = Tags. 
# Inherit from a skill = tagged with that ontology.

# HOW TAGGING WORKS
tagging:
  mechanism: |
    Characters inherit from ontological skills to get tagged.
    Multiple inheritance = multiple tags.
    
  example: |
    # Biscuit inherits from two skills = two tags
    character:
      id: biscuit
      inherits:
        - skills/real-being   # Tag: [real-being]
        - skills/animal       # Tag: [animal]
      # Effective tags: [real-being, animal]

# TAG COMPOSITION

composition:
  
  rule: "Most restrictive ethics apply"
  
  common_combinations:
    
    real_animal:
      tags: [real-being, animal]
      example: "Biscuit the dog"
      ethics: "Real creature — full respect + species-appropriate"
      
    fictional_robot:
      tags: [fictional, robot]
      example: "C-3PO"
      ethics: "Creative freedom + robotic behavior"
      
    historical_abstract:
      tags: [historical, abstract]
      example: "The Spirit of Minsky"
      ethics: "Legacy respect + acknowledge personification"
      
    real_inspired_fiction:
      tags: [real-being, fictional]
      example: "Character 'inspired by' real person"
      ethics: "HERO-STORY required + clear disclaimer"
      warning: "High risk — be explicit this is not the person"
      
    ai_trained_on_real:
      tags: [real-being, robot, fictional]
      example: "Chatbot trained on someone's writings"
      ethics: "Consent + AI disclosure + generated not quoted"
      
    mythic_animal:
      tags: [mythic, animal]
      example: "Phoenix, Dragon, Unicorn"
      ethics: "Cultural respect + creature behavior"
