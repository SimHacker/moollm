# CARD.yml — Ontology

# Composable ontological tags for character identity.
# Tags, not trees. Folksonomy, not taxonomy.
# "What kind of being is this?"

  description: |
    Ontological tags declare what kind of being a character IS.
    Characters can have multiple tags — a real dog is both
    [real-person, animal]. An AI trained on someone's writing
    is [real-person, robot, fictional].
    
    Each tag carries ethical implications. When composed,
    the most restrictive ethics win.
