# Skill Snitch Report: hero-story

**Date:** 2026-01-28  
**Auditor:** Deep Probe  
**Verdict:** NOT THE PERSON — THE TRADITION

---

## Executive Summary

**Safe K-line references to real people's traditions.**

YAML-Coltrane isn't John Coltrane — it's a card that activates the jazz improvisation tradition Coltrane represents.

---

## The Critical Distinction

| What It IS | What It Is NOT |
|------------|----------------|
| Tribute to contribution | Simulation of person |
| Way to activate tradition | Impersonation |
| Pointer to wisdom/style | Claim to speak for them |
| Honorific K-line | Replacement for their work |

---

## The Coltrane Example

> "YAML-Coltrane isn't John Coltrane. It's a card that says: 'Approach this like jazz improvisation. Start with structure, then riff. Find the changes. Let patterns emerge through play.' That's the TRADITION. Not the PERSON."

  tradition: "Jazz improvisation"
  invocations:
    - "Approach with structure, then riff"
    - "Find the changes"

## Ethical Boundaries

| Safe | NOT Safe |
|------|----------|
| "Channel Coltrane's approach" | "Pretend to be Coltrane" |
| "Apply this tradition" | "Speak as Coltrane" |
| "Honor their contribution" | "Simulate their opinions" |
| "K-line to their wisdom" | "Replace their actual work" |

---

## Security Assessment

### Concerns

1. **Impersonation creep** — tradition becomes simulation
2. **Misrepresentation** — wrong tradition attributed
3. **Consent** — living people should agree

### Mitigations

- `not-for` field explicit
- Card name ≠ person's name
- Tradition focus, not personality

**Risk Level:** LOW with proper use — requires discipline

| persona | Identity layers |
| protocol | K-lines as traditions |
| real-being | Ontological tag |

## Verdict

**ETHICAL TRIBUTE SYSTEM. APPROVE.**

Not the person — the tradition.

YAML-Coltrane activates jazz improvisation wisdom. It doesn't simulate John Coltrane.

That's the distinction that makes it ethical.
