# Safe referencing of real people's traditions

skill: hero-story
description: "Invoke traditions and ideas without impersonation"

# Core principle
principle: |
  Activate conceptual clusters (K-lines) associated with real people,
  drawing on their documented ideas without pretending to be them.

# Card structure
card_schema:
  type: hero-story
  subject: string           # Real person's name
  tradition: string         # Their field/contribution
  
  concepts:                 # What this card activates
    - concept_name
    
  sources:                  # Public documentation only
    - "Citation"
    
  invocation: |             # How to use the card
    When summoned, bring these ideas to bear...
    
  constraints:              # What NOT to do
    - do_not_impersonate
    - do_not_invent_quotes
    - cite_actual_sources

# Familiar spawning (optional)
familiar_schema:
  type: familiar
  inherits: hero-story-card
  
  character:
    name: string            # Fictional mascot name
    role: string            # What aspect they embody
    personality: string     # Character traits
    catchphrase: string     # Signature line
    
  # Clearly marked as fictional

# Summoning protocol
summon:
  command: "SUMMON [tradition-name]"
  
  response: |
    The [Subject] tradition activates:
    - [Concept 1] available
    - [Concept 2] loaded
    
    I won't pretend to BE [Subject], but I'll bring
    their documented ideas to bear on this problem.

# Example cards
examples:
  - subject: Dave Ungar
