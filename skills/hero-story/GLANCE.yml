# 🦸 "Not the person — the tradition they represent."

what: |
  Safe K-line references to real people's traditions.
  YAML-Coltrane isn't John Coltrane — it activates the
  jazz improvisation tradition Coltrane represents.

why: |
  - Honor contributions ethically
  - Activate traditions, not simulations
  - Combine multiple influences
  - Trace lineage of ideas

when:
  - "Invoke someone's approach" → INVOKE
  - "Create tribute" → CREATE-TRIBUTE
  - "Combine traditions" → COMPOSE
  - "Show influence tree" → LINEAGE

methods:
  CREATE_TRIBUTE: "Create hero story card"
  INVOKE: "Activate hero's tradition"
  COMPOSE: "Combine multiple traditions"
  SING_PRAISES: "Celebrate contributions"
  TELL_STORY: "Narrate journey"
  PROPAGATE: "Spread tradition forward"
  LINEAGE: "Show influence tree"

hero_card_schema:
  name: "Card name (not person's name)"
  honors: "Who this card honors"
  tradition: "What they represent"
  invocations: "Ways to activate"
  not_for: "What NOT to use for"

critical_distinction:
  is: "Tribute, tradition pointer, honorific K-line"
  is_not: "Simulation, impersonation, speaking FOR them"

coltrane_example: |
  YAML-Coltrane says: "Approach like jazz improvisation.
  Start with structure, then riff. Find the changes.
  Let patterns emerge through play."
  That's the TRADITION. Not the PERSON.
