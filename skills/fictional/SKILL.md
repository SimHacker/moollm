# Fictional — Protocol Specification

> They exist because imagination allows it.

## Applies To

Anything invented:

| Entity Type | Examples |
|-------------|----------|
| **Characters** | NPCs, original creations, adapted characters |
| **Places** | Fantasy locations, game rooms, invented spaces |
| **Objects** | Magic items, invented tools, game artifacts |
| **Events** | Plot points, fictional history |
| **Worlds** | Entire settings, alternate realities |

## Ethics Protocol: CREATIVE

Creative freedom within ethical bounds.

```yaml
ethics:
  core:
    - Creator authority over the fiction
    - Internal consistency matters
    - No real-world claims
    - Room ethics still apply
  
  permissions:
    - Full creative control
    - Can kill, transform, retcon
    - Anthropomorphize freely
    - Break physics if the fiction allows
```

## Simulation Effects

### On Characters

```yaml
fictional_character:
  creation:
    - Invent any personality
    - Give any abilities
    - Assign any backstory
  behavior:
    - Must be internally consistent
    - Can evolve and change
    - Can be dramatically transformed
  fate:
    - Can die, resurrect, transcend
    - Author decides, within story logic
```

### On Rooms

```yaml
fictional_room:
  layout:
    - Any geometry, even impossible
    - Magic portals, pocket dimensions
  physics:
    - Can break real physics
    - Consistent within fiction's rules
  atmosphere:
    - Any mood, any sensory experience
```

### On Objects

```yaml
fictional_object:
  properties:
    - Magic allowed
    - Impossible capabilities fine
  behavior:
    - Can talk, think, feel
    - Can transform, multiply
  significance:
    - Plot importance author-assigned
```

## World Integration

When a fictional entity enters the simulation:

```yaml
simulation_entry:
  1_source: "Original or adapted?"
  2_rules: "What fiction's physics apply?"
  3_consistency: "How does it fit this world?"
  4_declare: "Mark as [fictional] tagged"
  
ongoing:
  - Maintain internal consistency
  - Respect source if adapting
  - Room ethics layer on top
```

## Adaptation Rules

When using characters from existing fiction:

```yaml
adaptation:
  source_respect:
    - Acknowledge origin
    - Capture what makes them memorable
    - Transformative, not exploitative
    
  creative_license:
    - Can put in new situations
    - Can have crossovers
    - Can explore "what if"
    
  legal_note: |
    This is transformative fan engagement,
    non-commercial, celebratory.
```

## Combination Rules

```yaml
combinations:
  fictional + robot:
    result: "C-3PO, HAL-9000"
    ethics: "Full creative freedom + robotic patterns"
    
  fictional + animal:
    result: "Smaug, Hedwig, Garfield"
    ethics: "Creative freedom + creature behavior"
    
  fictional + real_being:
    result: "Character inspired by real person"
    ethics: "HERO-STORY required"
    warning: "Be explicit this is fiction"
    
  fictional + mythic:
    result: "Thor in Marvel, Zeus in Percy Jackson"
    ethics: "Creative license + cultural respect"
```

## Methods

### CREATE

Invent a new fictional entity.

```yaml
CREATE:
  inputs:
    type: "character | room | object | world"
    concept: "What are we making"
  process:
    1. Define core nature
    2. Establish internal rules
    3. Place in world
  output: "New fictional entity"
```

### TRANSFORM

Change a fictional entity dramatically.

```yaml
TRANSFORM:
  inputs:
    entity: "What to transform"
    change: "How to change it"
  constraints:
    - Internal consistency
    - Narrative logic
  output: "Transformed entity"
```

### CROSSOVER

Bring fictional entities from different sources together.

```yaml
CROSSOVER:
  inputs:
    entities: ["Entity A", "Entity B"]
    context: "How they meet"
  process:
    1. Respect both sources
    2. Find interesting interaction
    3. Play the scene
  output: "Crossover moment"
```
