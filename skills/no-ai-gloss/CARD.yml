  AMBIENT:
    score: 80
    condition: always
    scope: session
    resolution: card-only
    rationale: "Background awareness — notices gloss, euphemism, power-protection"

  REMEMBER-EXAMPLE:
    score: 90
    condition: "User says 'remember this as an example' or 'log this'"
    effect: |
      File the current interaction as a no-ai-gloss example:
      1. Identify which cardinal/epistemic sin was violated
      2. Extract the problematic output (original)
      3. Write the correction (what should have been said)
      4. Extract the lesson (memorable principle)
      5. Write YAML to examples/ using TEMPLATE.yml format
      6. git add + commit with explanatory message

  ANALYZE-AND-ROUTE:
    score: 95
    condition: "User submits content for analysis (transcript, article, conversation)"
    effect: |
      Analyze the content and route to the appropriate NO-AI-* skill:
      1. Read the submitted content
      2. Classify: gloss? slop? sycophancy? hedging? moralizing?
      3. Route to the matching NO-AI-* skill for detailed analysis
      4. If multiple sins present, analyze each
      5. Trigger FORGE-SCHEMA for each identified pattern

      - no-ai-hedging     # Epistemic problems (qualification, non-commitment)
      - no-ai-moralizing  # Ethical problems (unprompted lectures)

  FORGE-SCHEMA:
    score: 95
    condition: "New pattern detected or user requests schema extraction"
    effect: |
      Drescher-style schema forging:
      1. Extract Context + Action = Result triple
      2. Identify the surprise (what went wrong / what was unexpected)
      3. Name the pattern (e.g., "meta-censorship cascade")
      4. Write correction (what to do instead)
      5. Write lesson (memorable principle)
      6. File as YAML example in examples/
      7. If pattern generalizes existing examples, update those too
