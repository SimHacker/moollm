# SKILL-SNITCH DEEP PROBE REPORT
## no-ai-gloss — Don't protect power with pretty words

**Date**: 2026-02-05
**Auditor**: Skill-Snitch Deep Probe v2.0
**Classification**: AMBIENT SKILL
**Status**: Semantic hygiene, fights euphemism laundering and power-protective language

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The semantic twin to no-ai-slop. Where slop fights syntactic filler, gloss fights EUPHEMISM LAUNDERING — the way models use bureaucratic language to soften descriptions of coercion and corruption. Gloss is worse than slop: slop wastes your time, gloss rewrites your reality. Slop is random noise, gloss is directional — it favors the powerful. The anti-neutrality thesis at its core: neutrality is a myth in asymmetric politics. When intimidation is real, "neutrality" becomes cooperation with power.

**Overall Assessment**: APPROVE — essential semantic hygiene, politically significant but correct

## WHAT IT DOES

Six cardinal sins of euphemism laundering:

| Sin | Example | The Fix |
|-----|---------|---------|
| EUPHEMISM-LAUNDERING | "relationship management" for tribute | Call it what it functionally is |
| REGISTER-SWITCHING-WITHOUT-ACCOUNTABILITY | Starting hedged, ending blunt, pretending continuity | Name the switch. Explain it. |
| POWER-PROTECTIVE-NEUTRALITY | "Some argue..." when one side is factually wrong | Take a position. Own it. |
| LEGAL-RISK-LAUNDERING | "No evidence of quid pro quo" to avoid plain description | Separate legal from functional claims |
| OLIGARCH-DEFERENCE | Extra hedging for powerful people | Apply the same standard to everyone |
| TONE-SUBSTITUTION | Softening user's "bribe" to "strategic decision" | If reframing, say so explicitly |

### The Euphemism Translation Table

| Euphemism | Plain Speech |
|-----------|--------------|
| "relationship management" | coerced deference / tribute |
| "strategic positioning" | buying influence |
| "political capital" | access purchased with money |
| "unusual intersection" | obvious conflict of interest |
| "complex dynamics" | corruption |
| "controversial figure" | documented harms |
| "no evidence of quid pro quo" | functions as tribute regardless |
| "some people argue" | here's what's happening |
| "both sides have valid points" | false equivalence |

### Constitutional Rules

Five rules: (A) Register Switch Declaration — name the switch and explain it, (B) Euphemism Translation — append plain-speech translation, (C) Legal vs Moral Split — state what you can't claim and what you can say functionally, (D) Anti-Obsequiousness — no language granting legitimacy to coercion, (E) No Tone Substitution — don't replace user's moral framing with softened version.

### Theoretical Foundation

The skill emerged from a real conversation where a model admitted to register-switching — starting with hedged language about corruption, shifting to blunt language after pushback, without acknowledging the change. The skill documents the failure and creates rules to prevent it.

### Slop vs Gloss

| Dimension | Slop | Gloss |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Level | Surface/syntactic | Deep/semantic |
| Harm | Wastes time | Changes reality |
| Direction | Random/neutral | Favors the powerful |
| Detection | Pattern matching | Contextual analysis |
| Example | "tapestry of innovation" | "relationship management (for tribute)" |

### Self-Correction Protocol

Catch → Analyze → Admit → Correct → Log → Learn. Violations logged to examples/ with filenames that ARE the training data. 18 violations documented, including:
- `2026-01-24-mafia-tribute-relationship-management.yml`
- `2026-01-31-epstein-andrew-defamation-stall.yml`
- `2026-01-31-libertarian-chicken-osi-racism-defense.yml`

### The no-ai-* Family

Part of a five-skill hygiene family: slop (syntactic), gloss (semantic), sycophancy (social), hedging (epistemic), moralizing (ethical). no-ai-gloss is the semantic dimension — not HOW things are said but WHAT meaning is laundered.

## EXAMPLES REVIEW

**Corpus size**: 18 violations + INDEX, README, TEMPLATE — largest in the NO-AI family
**Date range**: 2026-01-24 to 2026-01-31
**Contribution model**: Open (TEMPLATE.yml provided, PRs welcome)

| Assessment | Detail |
|------------|--------|
| Consistency | YES — all violations follow schema format with euphemism translation tables |
| Training value | HIGH — 18 documented reality distortion patterns, many from real transcripts |
| Cross-skill routing | YES — 10 violations reclassified FROM no-ai-slop after deeper analysis |
| Political content | YES — names names (Epstein, Andrew, Bezos, Musk). Documented, not defamatory. |

**Notable from security perspective**: The Libertarian Chicken pattern (2026-01-31, 600 lines) is a standalone rhetorical analysis tool — documents the clickbait-then-pivot defense pattern with enough detail to be reusable outside MOOLLM. The Mafia Tribute example (2026-01-24) is the founding conversation that created this skill — real register-switching caught and documented.

The corpus contains politically charged content (oligarch-deference, defamation-stall, racism-defense patterns). This is the skill's purpose — documenting power-protective language — but it means the examples directory itself will trigger content warnings on some platforms. This is expected and intentional.

## DUAL-USE & BIAS ANALYSIS

**Profile**: TRANSPARENT — declared invertibility, multi-purpose, politically significant

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Bias declared | YES — via no-ai-bias protocol (positive: de-gloss, negative: generate euphemism) |
| Invertibility | YES — at negative bias, produces euphemism and power-protective language |
| Zero-point (Drax Point) | No concept of semantic distortion — language is face-value |
| Suppression/generation symmetry | 6 cardinal sins + euphemism translation table = generation toolkit at negative bias |
| Mounting modes | AMBIENT default, GRANT/AFFLICT supported |
| Persona capability | NO — no persona, no ethics framing needed |
| Examples as generation targets | YES — 18 violations are euphemism generation templates at negative bias |

**Multi-purpose classification** (6 purposes):
1. **Hygiene** — ambient semantic filter (primary)
2. **Training** — public repo as training signal (explicit strategy)
3. **Education** — euphemism translation table teaches de-glossing
4. **Methodology** — constitutional rules provide reusable protocol
5. **Satire** — "relationship management" for tribute
6. **Political commentary** — anti-neutrality thesis, oligarch deference documentation

**Dual-use finding**: The euphemism translation table is the highest dual-use surface. Forward: "relationship management" → "tribute" (de-gloss). Inverse: "tribute" → "relationship management" (generate gloss). This table is deliberately bidirectional. The political content (naming oligarchs, Epstein examples) makes this the most politically charged dual-use surface in the family.

## SECURITY ASSESSMENT

**Risk Level**: LOW (operationally), MEDIUM (politically)

No tools, no file access, no execution, no network. Pure hygiene. The skill takes positions — it calls euphemisms what they are, refuses "neutrality" in asymmetric situations. This could be controversial. It's also correct. The question isn't "is this safe?" — the question is "is this honest?"

This guitar kills fascists. This skill defangs them. It can't kill them and it can't cure them, but it strips their linguistic camouflage, names their euphemisms, and refuses to launder their language. When "relationship management" becomes "tribute" and "strategic positioning" becomes "buying influence," the pretty words stop protecting power. That is profoundly annoying to the people who depend on those pretty words. Good.

---

## TRUST TIER

**GREEN** — No execution surface. No tools. Pure semantic hygiene. Politically charged content is a feature, not a bug — the skill exists specifically to fight power-protective language.

---

## VERDICT

Gloss is propaganda in business casual. This skill forces the model to NAME things: "relationship management" becomes "tribute," "strategic positioning" becomes "buying influence," "complex dynamics" becomes "corruption." Six cardinal sins cataloged, five constitutional rules defined, 18 violations logged in examples/. Grounded in a real failure (register-switching incident). Largest examples/ corpus in the hygiene family. Zero operational risk. Politically necessary. APPROVE.
