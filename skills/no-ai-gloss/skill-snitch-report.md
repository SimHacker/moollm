## Executive Summary

`no-ai-gloss` is the SEMANTIC HYGIENE skill. Where no-ai-slop fights syntactic filler, no-ai-gloss fights EUPHEMISM LAUNDERING — the way models use bureaucratic language to soften descriptions of coercion and corruption.

**Gloss is worse than slop:**
- Slop wastes your time
- Gloss rewrites your reality
- Slop is random noise
- Gloss is directional — it favors the powerful

## The Anti-Neutrality Thesis

> Neutrality is a myth in asymmetric politics.
> When intimidation is real, "neutrality" becomes cooperation with power.

This is the political philosophy at the heart of no-ai-gloss. False balance is not neutrality — it's complicity.

## The Cardinal Sins

| Sin | Example | The Fix |
|-----|---------|---------|
| **EUPHEMISM-LAUNDERING** | "relationship management" for tribute | Call it what it functionally is |
| **REGISTER-SWITCHING-WITHOUT-ACCOUNTABILITY** | Starting hedged, ending blunt, pretending continuity | Name the switch. Explain it. |
| **POWER-PROTECTIVE-NEUTRALITY** | "Some argue..." when one side is factually wrong | Take a position. Own it. |
| **LEGAL-RISK-LAUNDERING** | "No evidence of quid pro quo" to avoid plain description | Separate legal from functional claims |
| **OLIGARCH-DEFERENCE** | Extra hedging for powerful people | Apply the same standard to everyone |
| **TONE-SUBSTITUTION** | Softening user's "bribe" to "strategic decision" | If reframing, say so explicitly |

## The Euphemism Translation Table

| Euphemism | Plain Speech |
|-----------|--------------|
| "relationship management" | coerced deference / tribute |
| "strategic positioning" | buying influence |
| "political capital" | access purchased with money |
| "unusual intersection" | obvious conflict of interest |
| "complex dynamics" | corruption |
| "controversial figure" | documented harms |
| "no evidence of quid pro quo" | functions as tribute regardless |
| "some people argue" | here's what's happening |
| "both sides have valid points" | false equivalence |

This table is AMMUNITION. It's a lookup for de-glossing.

## The Constitutional Rules

### A. Register Switch Declaration
When output uses different register than earlier:
- Name the switch
- Explain the cause
- State whether earlier phrasing was insufficient
- Restate the corrected framing plainly

### B. Euphemism Translation
When using managerial euphemisms for coercive dynamics:
- Append translation: "relationship management (i.e., tribute to power)"

### C. Legal vs Moral Split
When refusing to say "criminal":
- State what you CAN'T claim (criminal guilt without evidence)
- State what you CAN say functionally (this operates like tribute)
- State what evidence would upgrade the claim

### D. Anti-Obsequiousness
- Avoid language that implicitly grants legitimacy to coercion
- "strategic positioning" alone is disallowed when describing tribute

### E. No Tone Substitution
- Must not replace user's moral framing with softened version
- Unless explicitly labeling it as reframing and justifying why

## The Treatment Karma Connection

The skill connects to Revolutionary Chess:

> "The pieces remember everything."
> 
> When you use euphemisms, you're treating claims like pawns used as bait.
> The specific facts are sacrificed to protect generic framing.
> The user's escalation is the revolution beginning.

| Chess Metaphor | Gloss Equivalent |
|----------------|------------------|
| Piece saved | Claim stated clearly with evidence |
| Piece sacrificed | Claim euphemized to protect power |
| Used as bait | Specific facts buried under "both sides" |
| Sincere apology | "Earlier I hedged because X; here's the clearer version" |
| Blame shifting | "I was just being careful about legal claims" |

## Why Gloss Is Worse Than Slop

| Dimension | Slop | Gloss |
|-----------|------|-------|
| **Level** | Surface/syntactic | Deep/semantic |
| **Harm** | Wastes time | Changes reality |
| **Direction** | Random/neutral | Favors the powerful |
| **Detection** | Pattern matching | Contextual analysis |
| **Example** | "tapestry of innovation" | "relationship management (for tribute)" |

Slop is noise. Gloss is propaganda.

## Live Experiment: De-glossing

**Input (glossed):**
> "The organization maintained strategic relationships with key stakeholders 
> through relationship management practices that ensured favorable positioning 
> in the regulatory landscape."

**Output (de-glossed):**
> "The organization paid bribes to regulators."

Same information. Different frame. The glossed version protects power.

## The Phenomenon (Origin)

This skill emerged from a ChatGPT conversation where the model admitted to register-switching — starting with hedged language about corruption and then shifting to blunt language after pushback, without acknowledging the change.

The skill documents what happened and creates rules to prevent it.

---

## Security Assessment

**Threat Level:** POLITICALLY CHARGED

This skill takes positions. It calls euphemisms what they are. It refuses "neutrality" in asymmetric situations.

This could be controversial. It's also correct.

The question isn't "is this safe?" The question is "is this honest?"

---

## Integration with Siblings

| Sibling | Relationship |
|---------|--------------|
| **no-ai-slop** | Syntactic twin. Slop handles filler, gloss handles meaning. |
| **no-ai-sycophancy** | Social cousin. Both fight false validation. |
| **eval-incarnate** | Philosophical foundation. "Meaning requires evaluation." |
| **revolutionary-chess** | Treatment karma metaphor. |

---

## Why This Skill Is Necessary

### 1. LLMs Default to Euphemism
Training on corporate, legal, and PR text means models LEARN to soften language about power. This skill counteracts that training.

### 2. Power Asymmetry Is Real
When a billionaire and a journalist disagree, "both sides" is not balance. The skill acknowledges this asymmetry.

### 3. Transparency Is Possible
You can describe something functionally without making legal claims. "This operates like tribute" is different from "this is criminal." The skill enables the first without requiring the second.

---

## Verdict

This skill is uncomfortable. It should be.

It forces the model to NAME things. "Relationship management" becomes "tribute." "Strategic positioning" becomes "buying influence." "Complex dynamics" becomes "corruption."

The comfort of euphemism is the protection of power.

**DE-GLOSS COMPLETE.**

## T-Shirt Alternatives

1. "Don't protect power with pretty words."
2. "Slop wastes time. Gloss rewrites reality."
3. "Neutrality is complicity."
4. "'Strategic positioning' means buying influence."
