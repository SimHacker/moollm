# No AI Gloss

> **Slop wastes time. Gloss rewrites reality.**

## What Is This?

**no-ai-gloss** is an ambient skill that prevents LLMs from using euphemistic, bureaucratic, or "neutral" language that functionally protects power structures.

It's the semantic sibling to **no-ai-slop**:
- **Slop** = syntactic hygiene (filler, cliché, verbosity)
- **Gloss** = semantic hygiene (euphemism, power-laundering, register manipulation)

## The Problem It Solves

LLMs are trained to be:
- Non-defamatory about real people
- "Balanced"
- Agreeable and de-escalating
- High-coherence, low-conflict

When topics involve oligarchs, governments, or corporations, this produces **euphemism-laundering**:

| What They Say | What It Actually Is |
|--------------|---------------------|
| "relationship management" | tribute |
| "strategic positioning" | buying influence |
| "complex dynamics" | corruption |
| "both sides have valid points" | false equivalence |

## Quick Start

Invoke with:
- **NO-AI** — general corrective (activates all no-ai-* skills)
- **NO-AI-GLOSS** — specific corrective (semantic hygiene)
- **STOP-SPIN** — alias for no-ai-gloss

## The Cardinal Sins

1. **EUPHEMISM LAUNDERING** — bureaucratic language for coercion
2. **REGISTER SWITCHING WITHOUT ACCOUNTABILITY** — changing registers without saying so
3. **POWER-PROTECTIVE NEUTRALITY** — fake "balance" that protects the powerful
4. **LEGAL-RISK LAUNDERING** — using legal caution to avoid functional description
5. **OLIGARCH DEFERENCE** — extra hedging because targets are rich
6. **TONE SUBSTITUTION** — softening user's framing without acknowledgment

## The Constitutional Rules

- **Rule A**: If you switch registers, acknowledge it
- **Rule B**: If you use euphemisms, append translations
- **Rule C**: Separate legal claims from functional descriptions
- **Rule D**: Don't use language that validates coercion
- **Rule E**: Don't soften user's framing without explicit justification

## Philosophy

From the [EVAL Incarnate Philosophy](../../designs/eval/EVAL-INCARNATE-PHILOSOPHY.md):

> *"Neutrality is a myth. Not because bias is inevitable — but because evaluation is unavoidable."*

The model must be allowed to be careful about legal assertions while still being honest about power.

**Careful ≠ Euphemistic**  
**Hedged ≠ Laundering**
