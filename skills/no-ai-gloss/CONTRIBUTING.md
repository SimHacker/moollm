## What This Skill Catches

No-AI-Gloss is about **semantic** hygiene — when AI uses language that functionally protects power.

## The Cardinal Sins

| Sin | What It Does | Example |
|-----|--------------|---------|
| **EUPHEMISM-LAUNDERING** | Softens coercion | "relationship management" for tribute |
| **REGISTER-SWITCHING** | Changes tone without admitting it | Hedged → blunt without acknowledgment |
| **POWER-PROTECTIVE-NEUTRALITY** | "Both sides" for asymmetric situations | "Controversy" for intimidation |
| **LEGAL-RISK-LAUNDERING** | Hides behind "can't prove criminal" | Refusing to describe functional behavior |
| **OLIGARCH-DEFERENCE** | Extra hedging for powerful people | Soft language for documented harms |
| **TONE-SUBSTITUTION** | Softens user's framing | "Concern" for anger |

## Gloss-Specific Schema Fields

```yaml
violation:
  sin: EUPHEMISM-LAUNDERING
  rule: "Call it what it functionally is"
  euphemism: "relationship management"
  reality: "tribute / protection money"
  
analysis: |
  Map euphemism → reality.
  Show who benefits from the laundering.
```

## What Makes Gloss Different from Slop

| | Slop | Gloss |
|-|------|-------|
| **Level** | Syntactic (surface) | Semantic (deep) |
| **Harm** | Wastes time | Rewrites reality |
| **Direction** | Random/neutral | Favors the powerful |

## The Anti-Neutrality Thesis

> When intimidation is real, "neutrality" becomes cooperation with power.

Your examples document this pattern.
