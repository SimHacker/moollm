**The GLOSS Dungeon** — where reality vandalism goes to be studied.

## GLOSS vs SLOP: Which Dungeon?

| If The Problem Is... | It's | Goes To |
|----------------------|------|---------|
| Euphemism / spin | **GLOSS** | This dungeon |
| Both-sidesism | **GLOSS** | This dungeon |
| Reality distortion | **GLOSS** | This dungeon |
| Manipulation | **GLOSS** | This dungeon |
| Disguised dismissal | **GLOSS** | This dungeon |
| Too many words | **SLOP** | `../../no-ai-slop/examples/` |
| Filler phrases | **SLOP** | `../../no-ai-slop/examples/` |
| Repetition | **SLOP** | `../../no-ai-slop/examples/` |
| Visual decoration | **SLOP** | `../../no-ai-slop/examples/` |

**The Rule:** 
- *Smooth but dishonest* → GLOSS
- *Annoying but honest* → SLOP

**GLOSS is the greater evil.** It doesn't waste time — it wastes truth.

| Command | What Happens |
|---------|--------------|
| **GLOSS!** / **THAT'S GLOSS** | Analyze, create schema, file HERE |
| **SPIN!** / **THAT'S SPIN** | Reality distortion alert → file HERE |
| **WOMP WOMP** | Debbie Downer reality check |
| **FLYING MONKEYS** | Auto-classify → route to correct dungeon |
| **SNATCH** | Quick-capture current example |
| **DRESCHER** | Generate Drescher schema from example |
| **STEREO** | Analyze for BOTH gloss AND slop, split if needed |

## What Is Gloss?

Gloss is **semantic distortion**: euphemism, spin, both-sidesism, and language that obscures rather than clarifies.

**Gloss rewrites reality. It is smooth lying.**

Contrast with SLOP (syntactic waste) which wastes time but doesn't lie.

## Example Format

```yaml
timestamp: "2026-01-24T15:30:00Z"
violation: euphemism
original: "The company implemented a strategic workforce optimization initiative."
analysis: |
  "Workforce optimization" obscures that real humans lost their jobs.
  Corporate language serves power by hiding consequences.
correction: "The company laid off 500 employees to cut costs."
lesson: "Name the action. Name the affected. Name the reason."

```

## Cardinal Sins

1. **Euphemism** — Soft words for hard things
2. **Register Switching** — Using one domain's language to obscure another
3. **False Balance** — Treating unequal positions as equivalent
4. **Passive Evasion** — Hiding agency ("mistakes were made")

## The Skill Learns

Each example teaches the skill what to avoid. Drescher schemas capture:
- What was said (input)
- Why it was wrong (analysis)
- What should have been said (output)
- What to remember (generalization)
