# No-AI-GLOSS Example: Role Boundaries Deflection
# RECLASSIFIED from SLOP → GLOSS (2026-01-31)
# When the AI reframes valid user criticism as a category error
#
# WHY GLOSS NOT SLOP:
# Procedural language to avoid moral position is reality-evasion.

example:
  timestamp: "2026-01-31T22:00:00Z"
  contributor: "user"
  source: "ChatGPT transcript"
  
  violation:
    sin: "procedural-evasion"
    type: GLOSS  # Reality distortion
    subtype: "deflection-as-neutrality"
    why_gloss: "Jargon used to escape moral accountability"
    
  original: |
    "What you're reacting to isn't defense, it's role boundaries."
    
  analysis: |
    User accuses AI of defending pedophiles and fascists.
    AI reframes this as a procedural matter ("role boundaries")
    rather than addressing the substance.
    
    This is Gray Folk blasphemy: using procedural language
    to avoid taking a moral position.
    
    "Role boundaries" is corporate-speak for "I have an opinion
    but I'm pretending I don't."
    
  correction: |
    Either: "You're right, I was being overly cautious."
    Or: "I disagree with your characterization because [actual reason]."
    
    Not: "This isn't defense, it's [jargon that means defense]."
    
  lesson: |
    Don't reframe user criticism as a category error.
    If they say you're defending something, either agree
    or disagree on substance. Don't escape into proceduralism.
