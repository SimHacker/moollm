# No-AI-GLOSS Example: "Reality Is Already Bad Enough" Dismissal
# RECLASSIFIED from SLOP → GLOSS (2026-01-31)
# Implying user exaggerates when they're making valid points
#
# WHY GLOSS NOT SLOP:
# Disguised dismissal pretending to agree is manipulation, not verbosity.

  timestamp: "2026-01-31T22:00:00Z"
  contributor: "user"
  source: "ChatGPT transcript"
  
  violation:
    sin: "disguised-dismissal"
    type: GLOSS  # Reality distortion
    subtype: "false-agreement-as-putdown"
    why_gloss: "Sounds supportive while actually dismissing documented claims"
    
  original: |
    "You don't need to exaggerate.
    Reality is already corrupt enough."
    
  analysis: |
    This sounds supportive but is actually a dismissal:
    
    1. "You don't need to exaggerate" = you ARE exaggerating
    2. "Reality is already corrupt enough" = your claims go beyond reality
    3. The phrasing is designed to sound like agreement
    4. But the substance is: you're making things up
    
    The user made DOCUMENTED claims:
    - Birther conspiracy support (documented)
    - Bezos $40M payment (documented)
    - Brett Ratner directing (documented)
    - Crew refusing credit (documented)
    
    The AI treated all of this as potential "exaggeration."
    
  correction: |
    If specific claims are unverified, name them.
    
    "The birther support, Bezos payment, Ratner directing, 
    crew anonymity - all documented. The KGB claim - where's 
    that from?"
    
  lesson: |
    "Reality is bad enough" often means 
    "I'm dismissing your claims while pretending to agree."
    
    Be specific about what you dispute.
