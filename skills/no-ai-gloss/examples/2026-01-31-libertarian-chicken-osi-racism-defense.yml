# THE PATTERN

pattern:
  name: "Libertarian Chicken"
  also_known_as:
    - "Clickbait-Then-Pivot"
    - "You Didn't Read Carefully"
    - "I'm Too Smart For You To Criticize"
  
  definition: |
    A rhetorical trap where the provocateur:
    1. Makes an inflammatory statement (the "chicken")
    2. Buries a "nuanced" argument under the clickbait
    3. When criticized, claims critics "didn't read carefully"
    4. Attacks critics as fools, thugs, witch-hunters
    5. Never apologizes for the inflammatory framing
    6. Repeats the pattern
    
  game_theory: |
    If you DON'T react → They win (no pushback, statement normalized)
    If you DO react → They claim you're a "fool" who "didn't read carefully"
    
    There is no winning move within the frame.
    The only counter is to DOCUMENT THE PATTERN ITSELF.
    
  who_plays_it: "Libertarian provocateurs, contrarians, 'intellectual dark web' types"
  
  why_it_works: |
    - Exploits good-faith reading assumptions
    - Shifts burden of proof to critics
    - Exhausts critics with endless "you misunderstood" deflections
    - Creates in-group solidarity ("they can't handle our ideas")

# THE SEVEN-STEP CYCLE

steps:
  1_POST:
    action: "Make inflammatory statement with clickbait title"
    example: "Title your post 'Blacks are Lazy'"
    
  2_BAIT:
    action: "Bury 'nuanced' argument under inflammatory framing"
    example: "Claim you're making an 'economic' point about labor incentives"
    
  3_PIVOT:
    action: "When criticized, claim critics 'didn't read carefully'"
    example: "'You're substituting your own preoccupations'"
    
  4_DEFENSE:
    action: "Demand allies spend resources defending you"
    example: "'I wanted to fight this on principle'"
    
  5_ATTACK:
    action: "Label critics with delegitimizing terms"
    vocabulary:
      - "fools"
      - "thugs"  # dog-whistle
      - "witch hunt"
      - "ugly and ignorant"
      - "ranters"
      
  6_NEVER_APOLOGIZE:
    action: "At most, admit 'poor wording' — never substance"
    example: "Nelson: 'It was not well written' (not: 'It was racist')"
    
  7_REPEAT:
    action: "Continue believing you were right all along"
    example: "ESR's anger at 'fools and thugs' years later"

      - quote: |
          💬 "The people who called Russ a racist should be deeply ashamed 
          of themselves. The rants against him were ugly and ignorant, 
          ignoring what he actually wrote and substituting the ranters' 
          own preoccupations."
        patterns:
          - DARVO  # Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim and Offender
          - moral_inversion  # Critics should be "ashamed"
          - dismissal_framing  # "rants", "preoccupations"
          
      - quote: |
          💬 "The people who knew Russ as a Quaker, a pacifist and a gentleman, 
          and no racist, but nevertheless pressured OSI to do the responsible 
          thing and fire him in order to avoid political damage should be 
          equally ashamed. Abetting somebody else's witch hunt is no less 
          disgusting than starting your own."
        patterns:
          - character_witness_deflection  # Personal qualities negate racist statements
          - witch_hunt_framing  # Religious persecution metaphor
          - moral_equivalence  # Critics as bad as Nelson
          
      - quote: |
          💬 "Personally, I wanted to fight this on principle. Russ resigned 
          the presidency rather than get OSI into that fight. That sacrifice 
          makes me angrier at the fools and thugs who pulled him down."
        patterns:
          - principle_claiming  # Elevates racism defense to principled stance
          - martyrdom_framing  # "sacrifice", "pulled him down"
          - dog_whistle_vocabulary  # "thugs" — racial coding
          - attack_critics  # "fools and thugs"

# RHETORICAL TECHNIQUES (ESR EXEMPLARS)

rhetorical_techniques:

  DARVO:
    full_name: "Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim and Offender"
    how_esr_uses_it: "Critics become the aggressors; Nelson becomes the victim"
    example: "'fools and thugs who pulled him down'"
    
  moral_inversion:
    what: "Turn moral language against critics"
    how_esr_uses_it: "'should be deeply ashamed' — applied to anti-racists"
    effect: "Critics defending minorities are the 'real' wrongdoers"
    
  character_witness_deflection:
    what: "Personal qualities cited as proof against specific accusation"
    how_esr_uses_it: "'Quaker, pacifist, gentleman' therefore not racist"
    logical_flaw: "Being nice in some contexts doesn't prevent racism in others"
    
  witch_hunt_framing:
    what: "Cast criticism as religious persecution"
    how_esr_uses_it: "'witch hunt' — implies accusers are irrational mob"
    effect: "Delegitimizes substantive criticism"
    
  principle_claiming:
    what: "Elevate defense of indefensible to 'principled stance'"
    how_esr_uses_it: "'I wanted to fight this on principle'"
    reality: "The 'principle' is defending fellow libertarian's racism"
    
  martyrdom_framing:
    what: "Cast resignation as noble sacrifice"
    how_esr_uses_it: "'That sacrifice makes me angrier'"
    reality: "Resignation was damage control, not martyrdom"
    
  dog_whistle_vocabulary:
    what: "Words with racial coding"
    how_esr_uses_it: "'thugs' — historically used to delegitimize Black protesters"
    irony: "Using racially-coded language while defending against racism charge"

# DETECTION TEST

detection:
  questions:
    - "Is this clickbait-title-then-nuanced-argument?"
    - "Does the defense attack critics rather than address substance?"
    - "Is 'you didn't read carefully' the primary response?"
    - "Are critics labeled with delegitimizing terms (fools, thugs, mob)?"
    - "Is there 'witch hunt' or persecution framing?"
    - "Does the apology address framing, not substance?"
    
  if_yes_to_3_or_more: "Libertarian Chicken detected"

# THE FIX

the_fix:
  principle: "Document the pattern, not just the instance"
  
  how_to_counter:
    1: "Name the pattern explicitly ('This is Libertarian Chicken')"
    2: "Refuse to engage with 'you didn't read carefully' deflection"
    3: "Focus on the inflammatory framing, not the buried 'nuance'"
    4: "Document the attack vocabulary (thugs, fools, witch hunt)"
    5: "Point out the game theory trap"
    
  what_not_to_do:
    - "Don't try to prove you 'read carefully' — that's the trap"
    - "Don't engage with the 'nuanced' argument under the clickbait"
    - "Don't accept that 'poor wording' is the only problem"

# WHY THIS BELONGS IN NO-AI-GLOSS

why_no_ai_gloss:
  semantic_manipulation: "Using 'economics' framing to launder racist claims"
  power_protective: "Defending fellow ideologues from accountability"
  register_switching: "Crime domain → consultant speak ('relationship management')"
  false_equivalence: "Critics as bad as the racist"
  dog_whistle: "Racially-coded vocabulary in defense against racism charge"
  
  connection_to_existing_patterns:
    euphemism_laundering: "Economic framing for racist statement"
    witch_hunt_framing: "Persecution language for accountability"
    attack_critics: "Same vocabulary as mafia defending tributes"

# T-SHIRTS

t_shirts:
  - "'You didn't read carefully' is not a defense"
  - "Clickbait title → nuanced argument = bad faith"
  - "The pattern is the point"
  - "'Witch hunt' is what bullies call consequences"
