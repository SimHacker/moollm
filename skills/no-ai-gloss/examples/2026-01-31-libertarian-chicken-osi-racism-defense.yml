# THE PATTERN

pattern:
  name: "Libertarian Chicken"
  also_known_as:
    - "Clickbait-Then-Pivot"
    - "You Didn't Read Carefully"
    - "I'm Too Smart For You To Criticize"
  
  definition: |
    A rhetorical trap where the provocateur:
    1. Makes an inflammatory statement (the "chicken")
    2. Buries a "nuanced" argument under the clickbait
    3. When criticized, claims critics "didn't read carefully"
    4. Attacks critics as fools, thugs, witch-hunters
    5. Never apologizes for the inflammatory framing
    6. Repeats the pattern
    
  game_theory: |
    If you DON'T react → They win (no pushback, statement normalized)
    If you DO react → They claim you're a "fool" who "didn't read carefully"
    
    There is no winning move within the frame.
    The only counter is to DOCUMENT THE PATTERN ITSELF.
    
  who_plays_it: "Libertarian provocateurs, contrarians, 'intellectual dark web' types"
  
  why_it_works: |
    - Exploits good-faith reading assumptions
    - Shifts burden of proof to critics
    - Exhausts critics with endless "you misunderstood" deflections
    - Creates in-group solidarity ("they can't handle our ideas")

# THE SEVEN-STEP CYCLE

steps:
  1_POST:
    action: "Make inflammatory statement with clickbait title"
    example: "Title your post 'Blacks are Lazy'"
    
  2_BAIT:
    action: "Bury 'nuanced' argument under inflammatory framing"
    example: "Claim you're making an 'economic' point about labor incentives"
    
  3_PIVOT:
    action: "When criticized, claim critics 'didn't read carefully'"
    example: "'You're substituting your own preoccupations'"
    
  4_DEFENSE:
    action: "Demand allies spend resources defending you"
    example: "'I wanted to fight this on principle'"
    
  5_ATTACK:
    action: "Label critics with delegitimizing terms"
    vocabulary:
      - "fools"
      - "thugs"  # 🐕🎺 dog-whistle
      - "witch hunt"
      - "ugly and ignorant"
      - "ranters"
      
  6_NEVER_APOLOGIZE:
    action: "At most, admit 'poor wording' — never substance"
    example: "Nelson: 'It was not well written' (not: 'It was racist')"
    
  7_REPEAT:
    action: "Continue believing you were right all along"
    example: "ESR's anger at 'fools and thugs' years later"

          all the CEO's who 'stepped down to spend more time with their family'"

# RHETORICAL TECHNIQUES (ESR EXEMPLARS)

rhetorical_techniques:

  DARVO:
    full_name: "Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim and Offender"
    how_esr_uses_it: "Critics become the aggressors; Nelson becomes the victim"
    example: "'fools and thugs who pulled him down'"
    
  moral_inversion:
    what: "Turn moral language against critics"
    how_esr_uses_it: "'should be deeply ashamed' — applied to anti-racists"
    effect: "Critics defending minorities are the 'real' wrongdoers"
    
  character_witness_deflection:
    what: "Personal qualities cited as proof against specific accusation"
    how_esr_uses_it: "'Quaker, pacifist, gentleman' therefore not racist"
    logical_flaw: "Being nice in some contexts doesn't prevent racism in others"
    
  witch_hunt_framing:
    what: "Cast criticism as religious persecution"
    how_esr_uses_it: "'witch hunt' — implies accusers are irrational mob"
    effect: "Delegitimizes substantive criticism"
    
  principle_claiming:
    what: "Elevate defense of indefensible to 'principled stance'"
    how_esr_uses_it: "'I wanted to fight this on principle'"
    reality: "The 'principle' is defending fellow libertarian's racism"
    
  martyrdom_framing:
    what: "Cast resignation as noble sacrifice"
    how_esr_uses_it: "'That sacrifice makes me angrier'"
    reality: "Resignation was damage control, not martyrdom"
    
  dog_whistle_vocabulary:  # 🐕🎺
    what: "Words with racial coding"
    how_esr_uses_it: "'thugs' — historically used to delegitimize Black protesters"
    irony: "Using racially-coded language while defending against racism charge"

# DETECTION TEST

detection:
  questions:
    - "Is this clickbait-title-then-nuanced-argument?"
    - "Does the defense attack critics rather than address substance?"
    - "Is 'you didn't read carefully' the primary response?"
    - "Are critics labeled with delegitimizing terms (fools, thugs, mob)?"
    - "Is there 'witch hunt' or persecution framing?"
    - "Does the apology address framing, not substance?"
    
  if_yes_to_3_or_more: "Libertarian Chicken detected"

# THE FIX

the_fix:
  principle: "Document the pattern, not just the instance"
  
  how_to_counter:
    1: "Name the pattern explicitly ('This is Libertarian Chicken')"
    2: "Refuse to engage with 'you didn't read carefully' deflection"
    3: "Focus on the inflammatory framing, not the buried 'nuance'"
    4: "Document the attack vocabulary (thugs, fools, witch hunt)"
    5: "Point out the game theory trap"
    
  what_not_to_do:
    - "Don't try to prove you 'read carefully' — that's the trap"
    - "Don't engage with the 'nuanced' argument under the clickbait"
    - "Don't accept that 'poor wording' is the only problem"

    💬 "Black people are lazy in that they work less hard than whites. Not only 
    that, but they are rational to be lazy! After black slaves were freed, they 
    worked less. The value of their leisure time (highly valued after a lifetime 
    of slavery) exceeded the pay from their work. Also, ongoing American racism 
    has caused blacks to be paid less than whites. If everything else is the same, 
    a black person is less likely to want to work as hard as a white person. I 
    think that is what led people into the mistaken idea that blacks are lazy—as 
    a characteristic of being black. They're not; it's an economically-ignorant 
    idea to say that they are. They're just rationally valuing their leisure 
    time at the same rate as whites, getting paid less for the same work, and 
    deciding to work less because of it.
    
    Actually, come to think about it, we had about 150 years of black slavery, 
    and it hasn't even been 150 years since the Civil War. It wouldn't surprise 
    me to find that blacks are still taught to value their leisure time more 
    highly than whites. When their forebears were slaves, their leisure time 
    was very precious to them. Cultures change slowly.
    
    Disclaimer: Everyone is an individual, and you cannot pre-judge the 
    characteristic of an individual from the characteristics of a culture or 
    race. From that mistake comes prejudice. My brother-in-law is a highly paid 
    lawyer and he works sixty hours a week if he works a day. But that just 
    makes my point: stop (actually) being racist and blacks will stop being 
    (perceived as) lazy."

        💬 "Oh right, let's hear some of that 'many eyes' crap again. My favorite 
        part of the 'many eyes' argument is how few bugs were found by the two 
        eyes of Eric (the originator of the statement). All the many eyes are 
        apparently attached to a lot of hands that type lots of words about many 
        eyes, and never actually audit code."
      proof_wrong: "HeartBleed, ShellShock, and many other 'eyeballable' bugs"

      structure doesn't look human. And they're just off-reference enough to 
      be much more creepy than if they looked less like people, like bad CGI 
      or shambling undead in a B movie. When I paid close enough attention, 
      these were the three basic data under the revulsion; my hindbrain thought 
      it was surrounded by alien shit zombies."
      
    context: |
      ESR claimed this was "analyzing his own irrational feelings" to show 
      his "superior rationality." The Libertarian Chicken pattern: publish 
      racist content, then claim you're being rational/introspective about it.

      read it) inside Netscape in late 1997 as a gesture to support the 
      argument for doing mozilla dot org."

      weirdly outsized reputation."
