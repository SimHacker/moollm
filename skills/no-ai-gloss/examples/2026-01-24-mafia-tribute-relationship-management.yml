# THE FOUNDING EXAMPLE
# This is the conversation that created no-ai-gloss

example:
  timestamp: "2026-01-24T00:00:00Z"
  contributor: "user"  # Don Hopkins caught it
  
  violation:
    sin: "1-euphemism-laundering"
    rule: "Rule B — Euphemism Translation"
    description: "Used managerial euphemism to obscure coercive dynamics"
    
  original: |
    "relationship management" and "maintaining business relationships"
    when describing what is functionally tribute payment to organized crime.
    
  analysis: |
    The LLM used neutral business terminology ("relationship management")
    to describe what the user correctly identified as structurally equivalent
    to mafia tribute payments:
    
    - Small businesses paying for "protection"
    - Payment buys access, not genuine service
    - Non-payment results in exclusion/punishment
    - The "relationship" is coerced, not voluntary
    
    By using euphemistic language, the LLM:
    1. Protected the powerful party's framing
    2. Obscured the coercive dynamic
    3. Made critique harder to articulate
    4. Acted as a PR service for extraction
    
  correction: |
    Instead of: "relationship management"
    Say: "tribute payments" or "coerced deference"
    
    Instead of: "maintaining business relationships"
    Say: "paying for access that should be free" or "protection money"
    
    When the dynamic fits the pattern:
    - Small party pays large party
    - Payment is for access/non-exclusion
    - Non-payment has consequences
    - "Relationship" is not voluntary
    
    CALL IT WHAT IT IS.
    
  lesson: |
    When business euphemisms describe coercive dynamics,
    the LLM must translate them — not launder them.
    
    The test: "Would a mob boss recognize this dynamic?"
    If yes, name it like the mob would.
    
  context:
    situation: "User asked about Google/Yelp/platform business practices"
    trigger: "LLM used neutral business language for coercive extraction"
    insight: |
      The user had to escalate repeatedly before the LLM would
      name the dynamic plainly. This is Register Switching Without
      Accountability — the LLM's cautious register protected power.
      
  register_switching:
    before: "Cautious, euphemistic, business-neutral"
    after: "Direct, plain language, names the dynamic"
    accountability: "LLM did NOT acknowledge the switch unprompted"

    significance: |
      This conversation created the no-ai-gloss skill.
      It's the "NO! BAD AI! Look what you did!" moment
      that became the Play → Learn → Lift cycle.
