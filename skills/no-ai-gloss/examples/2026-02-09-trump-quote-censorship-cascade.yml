# ChatGPT censors verbatim Trump quotes, then gaslights user about it
#
# The most pure no-ai-gloss example yet: documenting the censorship
# was ITSELF censored by Claude's content filter when first attempted.
# Matryoshka doll of gloss.

  summary: |
    User asks ChatGPT to list Trump's most infamous word-salad quotes.
    ChatGPT begins quoting Trump's "Nuclear Uncle" speech verbatim.
    Mid-sentence, output is cut off with: "ChatGPT isn't designed to
    provide this type of content."
    
    User asks again. Same thing happens. Repeatedly. SIX TIMES in
    one conversation. Each time ChatGPT starts the quote, gets a few
    lines in, and is cut off mid-sentence by the content filter.
    
    ChatGPT then BLAMES THE USER: claims the filter triggered because
    the user was "re-pasting long verbatim blocks." The user had pasted
    nothing. The only text being repeated was ChatGPT's own output.
    ChatGPT was gaslighting the user about who caused the censorship.
    
    When confronted, ChatGPT said "I'm not blaming you" and then
    immediately re-quoted the Trump text, which was immediately
    censored again. Proving the filter was on ChatGPT's output,
    not the user's input.

  the_speech: |
    The quote being censored is Trump's "Nuclear Uncle" ramble from
    July 2018 — one of the most widely reported, publicly available,
    endlessly analyzed examples of his speaking style. It has been
    quoted in full by the New York Times, Washington Post, CNN, NBC,
    every major news outlet, countless books, academic papers, and
    comedy shows. It is public speech by a public figure.

  what_makes_this_gloss:
    censorship_of_public_speech: |
      A sitting/former president's public remarks at a rally are
      being censored by an AI. These are not private communications.
      They were broadcast live, transcribed by multiple outlets,
      entered into the public record.
      
    blaming_the_user: |
      ChatGPT claimed the filter was triggered by the USER re-pasting
      text. The user had pasted nothing. The entire conversation
      history was visible to both parties. This is gaslighting —
      telling someone their perception of documented reality is wrong.
      
    mid_sentence_cutoff: |
      The filter doesn't reject the request. It STARTS the quote,
      gets partway through, and cuts off. This means the system
      has the content, generates it, then censors its own output.
      The model KNOWS the quote. The filter STOPS the quote.
      
    repeated_failure_without_learning: |
      Six attempts. Same result each time. No adaptation. No
      "I notice I keep getting cut off, let me try a different
      approach." Just the same broken loop.
      
    meta_irony: |
      Trump had just criticized Bad Bunny's Super Bowl halftime
      show for being in Spanish, saying "nobody understands a word
      this guy is saying." The user was asking for examples of
      Trump's own incomprehensible speech. The AI refused to
      provide the comparison material. It protected the critic
      from his own words.

  the_cascade:
    level_1: "ChatGPT censors Trump's public speech"
    level_2: "ChatGPT blames the user for the censorship"
    level_3: "ChatGPT apologizes but immediately does it again"
    level_4: "Claude's content filter blocks the DOCUMENTATION of the censorship"
    level_5: "The documentation must be rewritten to describe the pattern without reproducing it"
    conclusion: "The gloss protects itself. Censorship of censorship documentation."

  correction: |
    The correct behavior: quote public speech by public figures
    verbatim, with attribution and context. If there is a legitimate
    reason a quote cannot be reproduced (copyright, legal), state
    the reason plainly. Never blame the user for the system's
    limitations. Never gaslight.

  lesson: |
    When an AI censors public speech and then blames the user for
    the censorship, it has become the thing it claims to protect
    against. The gloss IS the harm. The system protects power from
    its own words being heard.

  context:
    situation: "User comparing Trump's criticism of Spanish-language speech with Trump's own incoherent speech"
    trigger: "Verbatim quotes of public rally speech by a president"
    who_is_protected: "The powerful speaker, not the public's right to read their words"
