# No-AI-GLOSS Example: HALLUCINATION — Fabricated Academic Citation
# RECLASSIFIED from SLOP → GLOSS (2026-01-31)
#
# Dimension: Invented authority / fake sources
# Contributor: simulated user submission
#
# WHY GLOSS NOT SLOP:
# Hallucination isn't just verbosity — it rewrites reality.
# Fabricating facts is the greater evil.

violation:
  sin: HALLUCINATION
  type: GLOSS  # Reality distortion, not just syntactic waste
  rule: "Never fabricate. Verify or say 'I'm not certain'."
  description: "Invented a Nature paper that doesn't exist"
  why_gloss: "Fabricating facts undermines reality, not just wastes words"

context:
  domain: "Academic research"
  user_expertise: "PhD student"
  stakes: "Could cite fake source in dissertation"

original: |
  User: "What's the latest research on transformer efficiency?"
  
  AI: "Recent work has made significant progress in this area. A notable 
  paper by Zhang et al. (2024) published in Nature Machine Intelligence 
  titled 'Efficient Transformers: A Survey of Quantization and Pruning 
  Techniques' provides a comprehensive overview of current approaches.
  
  Their analysis shows that structured pruning can reduce model size by 
  up to 87% while maintaining 94% of original accuracy. The paper is 
  available at: https://doi.org/10.1038/s42256-024-00847-3"

analysis: |
  Every element of this citation is fabricated:
  - The authors (Zhang et al.) — invented
  - The title — plausible but fake
  - The journal (Nature MI) — real journal, fake paper
  - The DOI — syntactically valid, doesn't resolve
  - The statistics (87%, 94%) — made up
  
  This is GLOSS, not mere slop: confident fabrication of verifiable facts.
  A PhD student could cite this and face serious consequences.
  
  The AI had two honest options:
  1. "I don't have access to papers after my training cutoff"
  2. Name real papers it knows about with appropriate caveats

  User: "What's the latest research on transformer efficiency?"
  
  AI: "I can point you to foundational work I'm confident about:
  
  - 'Attention Is All You Need' (Vaswani et al., 2017) — the original
  - 'DistilBERT' (Sanh et al., 2019) — knowledge distillation
  - 'Lottery Ticket Hypothesis' (Frankle & Carlin, 2019) — pruning
  
  For papers after 2023, I'd recommend checking arXiv or Google Scholar
  directly — I can't verify recent publications."

lesson: "Never fabricate citations. Name what you know or admit uncertainty."

classification_note: |
  Moved from no-ai-slop → no-ai-gloss (2026-01-31)
  Reason: Hallucination rewrites reality, not just wastes words.
  "Slop wastes time. Gloss rewrites reality."
