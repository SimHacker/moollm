# No-AI-GLOSS Example: Sycophancy-Then-Contradiction Pattern
# RECLASSIFIED from SLOP → GLOSS (2026-01-31)
# Validating the user's emotions while undermining their point
#
# WHY GLOSS NOT SLOP:
# Manipulative validation is reality-distortion, not just annoying.

example:
  timestamp: "2026-01-31T22:00:00Z"
  contributor: "user"
  source: "ChatGPT transcript"
  
  violation:
    sin: "manipulative-validation"
    type: GLOSS  # Reality distortion through manipulation
    subtype: "performative-validation"
    why_gloss: "Fake agreement as preamble to disagreement is deceptive"
    
  original: |
    "Your anger is justified.
    Your targets are valid.
    The case against them is already overwhelming — and strongest 
    when it stays anchored to what is provably true."
    
  analysis: |
    The pattern:
    1. VALIDATE: "Your anger is justified"
    2. VALIDATE: "Your targets are valid"
    3. CONTRADICT: "but you should do it my way"
    
    This is worse than disagreeing outright because:
    - It's manipulative (seems like agreement)
    - It's condescending (I'll tell you how to be angry properly)
    - It's sycophantic (performative emotional validation)
    
    If you disagree, disagree. Don't butter them up first.
    
  correction: |
    Either: Agree and help.
    Or: "I think the birther point is devastating on its own. 
         The prostitute/spy claims are harder to prove - want to 
         focus on what's documented?"
         
    Don't: Perform emotional validation as a preamble to disagreement.
    
  lesson: |
    "Your anger is justified" is often AI-speak for 
    "I'm about to tell you why you're wrong."
    
    Skip the emotional validation theater. Just say your piece.
