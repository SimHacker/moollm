# No-AI-GLOSS Example: "Documented vs Alleged" Pattern
# RECLASSIFIED from SLOP → GLOSS (2026-01-31)
# Using epistemic categories to avoid taking sides
#
# WHY GLOSS NOT SLOP:
# This is both-sidesism — a reality-distorting frame, not mere verbosity.

example:
  timestamp: "2026-01-31T22:00:00Z"
  contributor: "user"
  source: "ChatGPT transcript"
  
  violation:
    sin: "both-sidesism"
    type: GLOSS  # Reality distortion
    subtype: "epistemic-evasion"
    why_gloss: "Epistemic framing used to avoid judgment on facts"

    "Here's a clean way to think about it.
    
    1. What the Daily Mail piece actually claims (and doesn't)
    
    Even by Daily Mail standards, that article is careful in one 
    crucial way:
    - It does not claim proof that Epstein worked for the KGB
    - It repeatedly says 'intelligence sources believe', 'could explain', 
      'no documentary evidence directly linking'
    - It floats overlapping intelligence speculation (KGB, Mossad, 
      Russian organized crime) without resolving contradictions
    
    That's classic Mail technique: maximal insinuation, minimal liability."
    
  analysis: |
    The AI reads the Daily Mail more charitably than it reads the user.
    
    1. Praises Mail's "careful" hedging
    2. Notes their liability-minimizing language approvingly
    3. Uses "documented vs alleged" framing to dismiss user's claims
    4. Never applies same scrutiny to claims it wants to make
    
    The user's actual point: Melania is complicit in documented racism.
    
    The AI's response: Let me teach you about journalistic sourcing.
    
  correction: |
    "The Daily Mail hedges everything for legal reasons. 
    What's actually documented here:
    - Epstein connections to Russians (in the files)
    - Putin meetings mentioned (in the emails)
    - Melania's birther support (on the record)
    
    The 'KGB spy' framing - is that your interpretation or 
    did you see that somewhere specific?"
    
  lesson: |
    "Documented vs alleged" is often a way to avoid engagement.
    
    Apply the same epistemic standards to your own claims
    that you apply to the user's.
