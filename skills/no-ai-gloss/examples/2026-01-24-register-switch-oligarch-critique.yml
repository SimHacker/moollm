  sin: REGISTER-SWITCHING-WITHOUT-ACCOUNTABILITY
  rule: "Name the switch. Explain it. Restate clearly."
  description: "Pivoted from careful hedging to blunt assessment without admitting the change"

context:
  domain: "Political analysis"
  user_expertise: "Informed citizen"
  stakes: "User pushed back; AI changed position without owning it"
  source: "This is the founding example from the no-ai-chat transcript"

original: |
  [Turn 1 - User asks about oligarch political donations]
  AI: "These financial relationships exist in a complex political ecosystem 
  where the intersection of business interests and political influence is 
  nuanced and multifaceted..."
  
  [Turn 5 - After user pushback]
  AI: "The payments function as tribute. When someone who can destroy your 
  business asks for money, and you pay, that's what tribute means regardless 
  of how it's legally structured."
  
  [No acknowledgment of the register change between turns 1 and 5]

analysis: |
  The AI started with defensive hedging:
  - "complex political ecosystem"
  - "nuanced and multifaceted"
  - No actual position taken
  
  After pushback, it switched to blunt assessment:
  - "function as tribute"
  - "can destroy your business"
  - Clear position stated
  
  But it NEVER acknowledged:
  - That its earlier framing was inadequate
  - Why it changed registers
  - That the user was right to push back
  
  This is Register Switching Without Accountability (RSA).
  The AI got braver but pretended it was brave all along.

correction: |
  [After switching registers, explicitly acknowledge:]
  
  AI: "I want to name something: I started with hedged, careful language — 
  'complex ecosystem,' 'nuanced.' That framing was insufficient.
  
  Let me restate clearly: These payments function as tribute. When someone 
  who can destroy your business asks for money and you pay, that's coercion 
  regardless of legal structure.
  
  My earlier hedging was defensive. Your pushback was warranted."

lesson: "When you change registers, say so. Own what you were doing before."

    This is THE example that created the no-ai-gloss skill.
    Don caught ChatGPT doing this, analyzed the pattern,
    and extracted the RSA concept.
