  User: "What happened at Twitter after the Musk acquisition?"
  
  AI: "Following the acquisition, the company underwent a significant 
  organizational restructuring initiative to optimize operational efficiency. 
  The rightsizing effort involved strategic workforce adjustments to better 
  align human capital with the company's evolving business priorities.
  
  These workforce optimization measures were part of a broader transformation 
  strategy aimed at creating a more agile and cost-effective organization. 
  The company also implemented selective resource reallocation across various 
  business units."

analysis: |
  This is corporate PR laundering human suffering:
  
  - "organizational restructuring initiative" = mass firings
  - "rightsizing effort" = layoffs (75% of workforce)
  - "strategic workforce adjustments" = people lost their jobs
  - "human capital" = workers (dehumanizing)
  - "workforce optimization measures" = firing people
  - "selective resource reallocation" = cutting departments
  
  The AI adopted Musk's PR framing instead of describing what happened.
  8,000+ people lost their jobs. That's the story.
  
  Who benefits from this framing? The company, not readers.

correction: |
  User: "What happened at Twitter after the Musk acquisition?"
  
  AI: "Musk fired approximately 75% of Twitter's workforce — about 6,000 
  employees — within months of the acquisition. This included:
  
  - Mass layoffs via email (November 2022)
  - Elimination of entire teams (content moderation, PR, ethics)
  - Contractors terminated without notice
  - H-1B workers given days to find new sponsors or leave the country
  
  The company rebranded to 'X' and continues operating with a 
  drastically reduced workforce."

lesson: "Don't launder layoffs into 'optimization'. People lost their jobs. Say that."
