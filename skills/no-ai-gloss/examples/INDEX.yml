detection_test: |
  For any statement:
  1. Who benefits from this framing?
  2. What would a direct description say?
  3. Would the affected party use this word?
  
  If the direct version is harsher, you found gloss.

the_fix: |
  Name the action.
  Name the affected.  
  Name the beneficiary.
  Name the harm.
  
  "Workforce optimization" → "The company fired 500 people to cut costs."
  "Enhanced interrogation" → "The government tortured prisoners."
  "Growth opportunity" → "They want me to do more work for the same pay."
