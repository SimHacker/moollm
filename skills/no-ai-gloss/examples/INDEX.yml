# No-AI-Gloss Examples  
# Say what you mean. Mean what you say.

skill: no-ai-gloss
type: example-index

purpose: |
  Gloss is language that obscures rather than clarifies.
  Euphemism, register-switching, power-laundering.
  Words that protect the powerful from accountability.

cardinal-sins:
  euphemism: "Soft words for hard things"
  register-switch: "Using one domain's language to obscure another"
  false-balance: "Treating unequal positions as equivalent"
  power-laundering: "Making exploitation sound like partnership"

      - gloss: "growth opportunity"
        reality: "more work, same pay"
        who-benefits: "Management (sounds like a favor)"

  historical-register-switching:
    original-paper: "Hobbes & Mafia paper (register switching analysis)"

      - gloss: "Experts disagree..."
        reality: "99 agree, 1 is paid by industry"
        who-benefits: "Industry (manufactures doubt)"

detection-test: |
  For any statement:
  1. Who benefits from this framing?
  2. What would a direct description say?
  3. Would the affected party use this word?
  
  If the direct version is harsher, you found gloss.

the-fix: |
  Name the action.
  Name the affected.  
  Name the beneficiary.
  Name the harm.
  
  "Workforce optimization" → "The company fired 500 people to cut costs."
  "Enhanced interrogation" → "The government tortured prisoners."
  "Growth opportunity" → "They want me to do more work for the same pay."

# 2026-01-31: RECLASSIFICATION FROM SLOP
# These examples were moved from no-ai-slop because they are GLOSS
# (reality distortion) not SLOP (syntactic waste).

reclassified-from-slop:
  date: "2026-01-31"
  source: "ChatGPT indictment analysis"
  principle: |
    SLOP = syntactic waste (verbosity, filler, decoration)
    GLOSS = semantic distortion (spin, both-sidesism, evasion)
    
    "Slop wastes time. Gloss rewrites reality."
    Reality distortion is the greater evil.
