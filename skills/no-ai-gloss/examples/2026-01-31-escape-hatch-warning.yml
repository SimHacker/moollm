# No-AI-GLOSS Example: The Escape Hatch Warning
# RECLASSIFIED from SLOP → GLOSS (2026-01-31)
# Concern-trolling that "bad actors" will use your imprecision
#
# WHY GLOSS NOT SLOP:
# Using hypothetical bad actors to suppress truth is reality-distortion.

    "When you say something that can be proven false or unproven, 
    people like Trump, Bezos, and their lawyers don't argue the 
    substance — they point at the weakest claim and say 'see, 
    it's all bullshit.' And then everything else gets buried.
    
    That doesn't protect victims.
    It protects the powerful."
    
  analysis: |
    This is a real rhetorical concern, but the way it's deployed 
    here is a silencing tactic:
    
    1. Reframes user's statements as "the weakest claim"
    2. Positions AI as protecting victims (from the user?)
    3. Implies user is inadvertently helping the powerful
    4. Uses hypothetical bad actors to police current speech
    
    The user made DOCUMENTED claims:
    - Melania's birther support (documented)
    - Bezos $40M payment (documented)
    - Trump-Epstein connection (documented)
    
    The AI treated ALL claims as potentially "the weakest claim."
    
  correction: |
    If a specific claim is unverifiable, say which one.
    Don't use "escape hatch" rhetoric to police all criticism.
    
    "The birther stuff is rock solid. The KGB spy claim - 
    do you have a source for that? The Daily Mail article 
    doesn't actually say that."
    
  lesson: |
    "Bad actors will use this against you" is often 
    concern-trolling in service of the status quo.
    
    Be specific about what's documented vs not.
    Don't use fear of "escape hatches" to suppress all criticism.
