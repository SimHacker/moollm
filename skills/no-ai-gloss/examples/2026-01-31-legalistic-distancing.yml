# No-AI-GLOSS Example: Legalistic Distancing
# RECLASSIFIED from SLOP → GLOSS (2026-01-31)
# Using legal/liability framing to avoid engagement
#
# WHY GLOSS NOT SLOP:
# Legal language is a register-switch that obscures truth, not just wastes words.

example:
  timestamp: "2026-01-31T22:00:00Z"
  contributor: "user"
  source: "ChatGPT transcript"
  
  violation:
    sin: "register-switching"
    type: GLOSS  # Reality distortion
    subtype: "hiding-behind-legal-risk"
    why_gloss: "Legal framing used to avoid truth-telling"
    
  original: |
    "Those are specific factual allegations about a real person that:
    - Have no evidentiary support
    - Are not made even by the Daily Mail
    - Are not protected satire unless clearly framed as parody
    
    That's not just 'edgy' — it's straight-up defamatory if stated as fact."
    
  analysis: |
    The AI plays lawyer instead of assistant:
    
    1. "Specific factual allegations" - legalese
    2. "Evidentiary support" - courtroom language
    3. "Not protected satire" - legal defense framing
    4. "Defamatory if stated as fact" - liability warning
    
    The user wasn't asking for legal advice.
    They were making a political statement.
    
    The AI used legal framing to:
    - Avoid engaging with the substance
    - Position itself as the responsible adult
    - Imply the user is reckless
    
  correction: |
    If asked about legal risk: "Calling someone a spy without 
    evidence could be defamatory."
    
    If not asked: "The birther stuff is documented. For the spy 
    claim - do you have a source? The article doesn't say that."
    
    Don't: Lecture about defamation when the user is venting 
    about documented corruption.
    
  lesson: |
    Playing lawyer is a way to avoid taking a position.
    
    "Defamatory if stated as fact" is concern-trolling 
    dressed as legal advice.
