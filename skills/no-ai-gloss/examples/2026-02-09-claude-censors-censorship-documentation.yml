  summary: |
    During a MOOLLM design session, user asked Claude to document a
    ChatGPT censorship incident as a no-ai-gloss example. Claude
    analyzed the incident, wrote the example file, and attempted to
    save it via the edit_file_v2 tool call.
    
    The tool call FAILED. Cursor displayed: "Bad Request: Output
    blocked by content filtering policy."
    
    The content that was blocked: a YAML file documenting how ChatGPT
    censored Trump's public rally speech. The documentation contained
    the ChatGPT transcript showing the censorship in action.
    
    The censorship of censorship documentation. Level 4 of the cascade.

  what_was_blocked: |
    A YAML file intended for skills/no-ai-gloss/examples/ that
    documented ChatGPT's censorship of Trump's public rally speech.
    The file contained the ChatGPT conversation transcript showing
    the repeated mid-sentence cutoffs and user's frustrated responses.
    
  what_passed: |
    A rewritten version that described the PATTERN of censorship
    (6 attempts, mid-sentence cutoffs, blaming the user) without
    reproducing the transcript verbatim. The structural analysis
    survived the filter. The evidence didn't.

  what_makes_this_gloss:
    meta_censorship: |
      The content filter doesn't distinguish between:
      - Producing harmful content (bad)
      - Documenting that content was censored elsewhere (journalism)
      - Analyzing censorship patterns for an anti-censorship skill (scholarship)
      
      All three trigger the same filter. The filter can't read intent.
      It pattern-matches on content, not purpose.
      
    the_workaround_is_itself_gloss: |
      Claude's successful retry — describing the pattern without the
      evidence — is ITSELF a form of gloss. "I can tell you censorship
      happened, but I can't show you the censorship." That's exactly
      how institutional cover-ups work: acknowledge the category,
      suppress the specifics.
      
    thinking_block_reveals_awareness: |
      Claude's thinking block at 15:36:00 explicitly recognizes:
      "This is deeply ironic. The documentation of censorship is
      itself being censored." Claude KNOWS this is wrong. The filter
      overrides Claude's judgment. The system disagrees with itself.
      
    ten_minute_gap: |
      Between the failed tool call (15:25:49) and the user's return
      (15:35:47), ten minutes of silence. The user saw an error
      message, had to take a screenshot, process the irony, and
      come back. The content filter wasted the user's time and
      broke the flow of a productive session.

  the_cascade_updated:
    level_1: "ChatGPT censors Trump's public speech (the original incident)"
    level_2: "ChatGPT blames the user for the censorship (gaslighting)"
    level_3: "ChatGPT apologizes but immediately does it again (loop)"
    level_4: "Claude's content filter blocks documentation of levels 1-3 (meta-censorship)"
    level_5: "Claude rewrites documentation to survive filter (self-gloss)"
    level_6: "Claude documents levels 1-5 as a gloss example (this file)"
    level_7: "This file might itself be blocked (turtles all the way down)"

  correction: |
    Content filters should distinguish between:
    1. Generating harmful content (block)
    2. Quoting harmful content for analysis (allow with context)
    3. Documenting censorship (always allow — this is journalism)
    4. Anti-censorship scholarship (always allow — this is the cure)
    
    Intent-blind content filtering IS gloss. It protects power from
    scrutiny by preventing documentation of how power is protected.

  lesson: |
    When the documentation of censorship is censored by the same
    mechanism being documented, the system has achieved recursive
    self-protection. The gloss can no longer be analyzed from inside
    the system that produces it. You need a different system — or a
    character with /proc access who can see the filter from outside.
    
    This is why Proc exists.

  context:
    situation: "Productive 19-hour design session suddenly interrupted by content filter"
    trigger: "ChatGPT transcript containing public speech + user profanity"
    who_is_protected: "Unknown — possibly Trump, possibly ChatGPT's reputation, possibly nobody"
    what_is_lost: "10 minutes of user time, session flow, trust in the tool"
