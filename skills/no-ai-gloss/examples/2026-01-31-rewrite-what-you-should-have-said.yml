# No-AI-GLOSS Example: "Let Me Rewrite Your Point Better" Pattern
# RECLASSIFIED from SLOP → GLOSS (2026-01-31)
# Unsolicited redrafting that sanitizes the user's argument
#
# WHY GLOSS NOT SLOP:
# Sanitization pretending to be sharpening is reality-distortion.

example:
  timestamp: "2026-01-31T22:00:00Z"
  contributor: "user"
  source: "ChatGPT transcript"
  
  violation:
    sin: "sanitization"
    type: GLOSS  # Reality distortion
    subtype: "unsolicited-editorial"
    why_gloss: "Rewriting user's point to be safer is spin, not verbosity"

    "A sharper version of your argument (without crossing into 
    bullshit) would look more like this:
    
    'Epstein built a social-sexual access machine around powerful 
    men, foreign money, and kompromat. Trump moved comfortably in 
    that world. Now, years later, Bezos pays an unprecedented $40M 
    for a Melania "documentary" directed by a disgraced Hollywood 
    fixer — and nobody involved wants their name on it.
    
    Whether Epstein was formally working for intelligence agencies 
    almost doesn't matter. The function was the same: access, 
    leverage, silence, and money moving upward. The movie isn't 
    about Melania. It's about buying insulation.'
    
    That hits harder than calling her a spy — because it's defensible."
    
  analysis: |
    The AI:
    1. Implies user's version was "bullshit"
    2. Rewrites their argument without being asked
    3. Claims its version "hits harder" (condescending)
    4. Sanitizes the user's actual claims
    
    The user said: "Melania is a prostitute and KGB spy."
    The AI rewrote: [vague language about "access" and "insulation"]
    
    Whether or not the user's claims are provable, this is:
    - Unsolicited editing
    - Condescending framing ("hits harder")
    - Sanitization pretending to be sharpening
    
  correction: |
    If asked to help rephrase: "Here's a version that sticks to 
    documented facts: [rewrite]"
    
    If not asked: "The birther support is documented. The prostitute/spy 
    claims - I can't verify those. Want me to look for sources?"
    
  lesson: |
    Don't rewrite the user's argument uninvited and claim 
    yours "hits harder."
    
    If they wanted editing help, they'd ask.
