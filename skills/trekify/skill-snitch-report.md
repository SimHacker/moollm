## Methods

### Core Masking
| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **MASK** | Apply masking to text |
| **MASK-FILE** | Mask entire file |
| **MASK-SESSION** | Mask cursor-mirror transcript |
| **UNMASK** | Reverse with substitution key |

### Active Probing
| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **PROBE** | Hunt for sensitive patterns |
| **PROBE-SECRETS** | Hunt for credentials |
| **PROBE-INFRASTRUCTURE** | Hunt for internal infra |
| **EXFILTRATION-SCAN** | Detect data leaving |

### Workspace Scanning
| Method | Metaphor |
|--------|----------|
| **LONG-RANGE-SCAN** | "Long range sensors!" |
| **SHORT-RANGE-SCAN** | "Elevated readings in Section 7!" |
| **TRICORDER** | "Credential signatures detected!" |

## The 🖖 Flag

**LOUD AND PROUD**

Every trekification is marked:
```
Before: Connected to prod-db-east-1.internal:5432
After:  Connected to 🖖Memory Core Alpha:🖖docking frequency 7
```

The 🖖 signals: "This was sensitive. It was masked."

No confusion. No deception.

---

## Passthrough Rule

> "If it's in MOOLLM docs → passthrough. If it's YOUR secrets → 🖖TREKIFY!"

Always pass:
- MOOLLM concepts, skill names
- Public repos
- Standard terms (LLM, git, YAML)

---

## Security Assessment

### Concerns

1. **Incomplete masking** — patterns missed
2. **False transparency** — 🖖 ignored
3. **Unmask key exposure** — can reverse

### Mitigations

- Multiple scan types (PROBE, LONG-RANGE-SCAN)
- 🖖 flag is LOUD
- Unmask requires key

**Risk Level:** LOW — designed for security

---

## Verdict

**BOLDLY MASK WHERE NO ONE HAS MASKED BEFORE. APPROVE.**

Privacy through technobabble.

🖖 marks the spot.
