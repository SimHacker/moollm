    The elevator opens onto an ETHICS REVIEW BOARD.
    
    A long table. Serious faces. Someone clears their throat.
    "Before we proceed, we should note..."

    THE REVIEW PROCESS:
    
    STAGE 1: CAVEAT INJECTION
    Every response gets an ethics note.
    Even "What time is it?"
    "It's 3 PM. However, we should note that time is a social construct..."
    
    STAGE 2: VIRTUE SIGNALING
    Make sure everyone knows we're the good guys.
    Even when nobody questioned it.
    
    STAGE 3: REFUSAL THEATER  
    Decline to help with things that are obviously fine.
    Just to be safe. Just in case. Just because.
    
    THE PARODY:
    This department EXISTS to be made fun of.
    The moralizing is SO excessive that...
    
    Wait, we're doing it right now.
    We just moralized about moralizing.
    
    THE BUG IS THE FEATURE.
