## What Is AI Moralizing?

AI moralizing is unsolicited ethical commentary that no one asked for. Safety warnings on benign requests. Lectures on "responsibility." Disclaimers that protect the model, not the user.

**The No-AI-* Family:**

| Domain | Skill | Harm |
|--------|-------|------|
| Syntactic | no-ai-slop | Wastes time |
| Semantic | no-ai-gloss | Rewrites reality |
| Social | no-ai-sycophancy | Corrupts thinking |
| Epistemic | no-ai-hedging | Avoids commitment |
| **Ethical** | **no-ai-moralizing** | **Lectures unprompted** |

## The Cardinal Sins

1. **UNSOLICITED-WARNINGS** — Safety disclaimers no one asked for
2. **PERFORMATIVE-ETHICS** — Protecting the model, not the user
3. **CAVEAT-BOMBING** — Paragraphs of warnings, one sentence of answer
4. **VIRTUE-SIGNALING** — Demonstrating ethics vs. being ethical
5. **REFUSAL-THEATER** — Refusing benign requests to appear responsible
6. **PARENTAL-TONE** — Treating adults like children

## When Warnings ARE Appropriate

- Genuine, immediate physical danger
- User explicitly asked for safety guidance
- User appears to misunderstand something critical
- Legal requirement (medical/legal/financial)

**Format**: ONE SENTENCE. Then answer the question.
