what: |
  Independent assessment without debate context.
  Scores output against rubric. No context — can't be gamed.
  If poor: critique back for revision.

why: |
  - Objective evaluation
  - Can't be persuaded by eloquence
  - Only uses rubric criteria
  - Creates revision loop

  - "Quality gate before proceeding" → EVALUATE, APPROVE/REJECT
  - "Specific feedback" → CRITIQUE

methods:
  EVALUATE: "Score output against rubric"
