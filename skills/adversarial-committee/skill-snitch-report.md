# Skill Snitch Report: adversarial-committee

**Date:** 2026-01-28  
**Auditor:** Deep Probe  
**Verdict:** STORIES FIGHT. WISDOM SURVIVES.

---

## Executive Summary

**Multiple personas with incompatible values debate to surface blind spots.**

No single story is true — but the ensemble approximates actionable wisdom.

---

## The Core Insight

> "Make the stories fight. See what survives."

Single perspectives have blind spots. Multiple perspectives with **opposing propensities** catch each other's errors.

---

## Default Roster

| Member | Propensity | Surfaces | Voice |
|--------|------------|----------|-------|
| **Maya** | Paranoid-realism | Hidden agendas, traps | "What aren't they telling us?" |
| **Frankie** | Idealism | Value conflicts, opportunities | "What if this is exactly what it seems?" |
| **Joe** | Continuity-guardian | Institutional memory | "We tried this in 2019..." |
| **Vic** | Evidence-prosecutor | Data gaps, unverified claims | "Show me the numbers." |
| **Tammy** | Systems-thinking | Unintended consequences | "If we do X, then Y will respond by..." |

---

## Workflow

```
FORM committee with personas
    ↓
CONVENE session with topic
    ↓
DELIBERATE following roberts-rules
    ↓
VOTE on motion
    ↓
EVALUATE output against rubric
    ↓
If poor: critique → DELIBERATE again
    ↓
DISSOLVE when decision reached
```

---

## Methods

| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **FORM** | Create committee with selected personas |
| **CONVENE** | Start session, opening statements |
| **DELIBERATE** | Run one round of debate |
| **VOTE** | Call for vote on motion |
| **EVALUATE** | Send to independent evaluator |
| **DISSOLVE** | End committee, archive decision |

---

## Session States

```
forming → convened → deliberating → voting → adjourned
```

---

## Integration with Speed-of-Light

The committee can run **entirely in one LLM call** using speed-of-light:

- No API round-trips between personas
- All voices in context simultaneously
- Instant telepathy between committee members
- Full debate in single generation

---

## Security Assessment

### Concerns

1. **Persona injection** — malicious persona could dominate
2. **Groupthink** — despite diversity, convergence possible
3. **File writes** — decisions written to files

### Mitigations

- Robert's Rules moderates
- Independent evaluation catches groupthink
- All deliberation logged and auditable

**Risk Level:** LOW — structured, observable deliberation

## Lineage

| Source | Contribution |
|--------|--------------|
| **Mike Gallaher** | "Stories All the Way Down" |
| **Academic peer review** | Multiple reviewers catch errors |
| **Jury deliberation** | Diverse perspectives required |
| **Design critique** | Structured feedback sessions |

---

## Why Opposing Propensities?

| Problem | Single Perspective | Committee |
|---------|-------------------|-----------|
| Hidden agenda | Missed | Maya catches |
| Optimistic bias | Unchecked | Joe remembers failures |
| Unverified claims | Accepted | Vic demands evidence |
| Second-order effects | Ignored | Tammy traces consequences |
| Value opportunity | Cynically dismissed | Frankie advocates |

---

## Verdict

**WISDOM THROUGH CONFLICT. APPROVE.**

The insight: **truth emerges from structured disagreement**.

Single voices have biases. Ensembles of opposing biases approximate objectivity.
