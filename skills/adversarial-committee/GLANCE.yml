# 🗳️ "No single story is true — the ensemble approximates wisdom."

what: |
  Multiple personas with opposing propensities debate.
  Robert's Rules procedure. Independent evaluation.
  Surface blind spots through structured disagreement.

why: |
  - Complex decisions need multiple perspectives
  - Avoid blind spots via opposing propensities
  - Stress-test plans before commitment
  - Generate options through diverse framing

when:
  - "Complex decision, no obvious answer" → FORM, CONVENE
  - "Worried about blind spots" → DELIBERATE
  - "Stress-test a plan" → EVALUATE

  joe: "Continuity-guardian — 'We tried this in 2019...'"
  vic: "Evidence-prosecutor — 'Show me the numbers.'"
  tammy: "Systems-thinking — 'If we do X, then Y responds...'"
