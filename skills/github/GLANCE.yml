# GLANCE.yml — github
# 🐧 "Talk is cheap. Show me the code."

  Core GitHub operations: repos, issues, PRs, commits, branches.

  - Commits are the unit of change

when:
  - "Need to create issue" → gh issue create
  - "Need to review PR" → gh pr view, gh pr review
  - "Need to commit" → git commit
  - "Need to branch" → git checkout -b
