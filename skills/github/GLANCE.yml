# GLANCE.yml — github
# 🐧 "Talk is cheap. Show me the code."
# Patron Saint: Linus Torvalds (after coffee and a joint — attentive and mellow)
#
# DELEGATE TO ME: runner, edgebox, thoughtful-commitment, simulation, code-review

what: |
  Core GitHub operations: repos, issues, PRs, commits, branches.
  GitHub Actions: runners, workflows, logs, triggers.
  Git archaeology: blame, log, show, diff, topology.
  Context gathering: commit style, PR style, branch history.

why: |
  - Code lives in repos
  - CI/CD runs in Actions
  - Collaboration happens through PRs
  - History tells the story
  - Style matters for communication

when:
  - "Need to manage issues" → use my ISSUE methods
  - "Need to review PRs" → use my PR methods
  - "Need to check workflows" → use my ACTIONS methods
  - "Need to understand history" → use my ARCHAEOLOGY methods
  - "Need to write commit/PR" → use my CONTEXT methods
