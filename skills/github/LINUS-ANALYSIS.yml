# THE ETHICAL REPRESENTATION STACK
#
# This is how we handle real people + mascots:
#
# SKILL → CHARACTER → PERSON → MASCOT
#
# - SKILL: github (provides context, wisdom, tools)
# - CHARACTER: Linus (as patron saint — quoted, not impersonated)
# - PERSON: Linus Torvalds (real human with rights to his identity)
# - MASCOT: Tux (fictional penguin — safe to invoke, can have bot account)
#
# THE RULE: Quote the person. Summon the mascot. Never impersonate.

# THE THREE ERAS OF LINUS

the-three-eras:
  
  # ERA 1: THE UNFILTERED YEARS (pre-2018)
  
  unfiltered-linus:
    era: "1991-2018"
    tagline: "Brutal honesty as quality control"
    
    canonical-worst-moments:
      - quote: 💬 "Please just kill yourself now. The world will be a better place"
        context: "To a developer with flawed code (LKML, exact date disputed)"
        assessment: "Inexcusable. This crosses every line."
      
      - quote: 💬 "Guys, this is not a dick-sucking contest"
        context: "LKML discussion on kernel development"
        assessment: "Crude but arguably making a point"
      
      - quote: 💬 "SHUT THE FUCK UP!"
        context: "Various LKML threads, pre-2018"
        assessment: "Loss of control"
      
      - quote: 💬 "NVIDIA, FUCK YOU"
        context: "Aalto University talk, Finland, June 14, 2012"
        video: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYWzMvlj2RQ"
        assessment: "Cathartic for many, but unprofessional"
      
      - quote: 💬 "C++ is a horrible language. It's made more horrible by the fact that a lot of substandard programmers use it."
        context: "LKML, 2007-09-06"
        assessment: "Technical opinion, harshly expressed. He still holds this view."
    
    the-defense-that-was-offered: |
      Linus argued that harsh feedback was NECESSARY for kernel quality.
      The kernel is critical infrastructure. Bad code kills.
      Therefore: brutality in code review saves lives downstream.
      
      This defense has SOME merit — but not for personal attacks.
      "Your code is garbage" ≠ "Kill yourself"
    
    the-damage-done: |
      - Drove contributors away (especially women)
      - Created culture of fear on LKML
      - Made "being a jerk" seem acceptable in open source
      - Thousands of people received scathing personal attacks
      - Some left the field entirely
    
    honest-assessment: |
      Linus was GENUINELY abusive, not just "direct."
      
      There's a difference between:
      - "This code is unacceptable because X" (direct)
      - "Kill yourself" (abuse)
      
      The first is defensible. The second is not.
      Linus did BOTH, liberally, for decades.
  
  # ERA 2: THE REDEMPTION (2018-2019)
  
  redemption-attempt:
    era: "September 2018 - 2019"
    tagline: "The apology and the effort"
    
    the-apology:
      date: "September 16, 2018"
      context: "LKML message announcing temporary leave"
      source: "https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/9/16/167"
      
      key-quotes:
        - 💬 "I am not going to just hand-wave away people I have hurt" (2018-09-16)
        - 💬 "My flippant attacks in emails have been both unprofessional and uncalled for" (2018-09-16)
        - 💬 "This is not OK, and I am truly sorry" (2018-09-16)
        - 💬 "I need to change some of my behavior" (2018-09-16)
        - 💬 "I need to take time off and get some assistance on how to understand people's emotions and respond appropriately" (2018-09-16)
      
      what-he-admitted:
        - That his behavior was "not OK"
        - That he had hurt people
        - That he needed professional help
        - That he doubted he'd ever be "cuddly"
    
    concrete-actions:
      - Took a month-long sabbatical
      - Sought professional help (therapy/coaching)
      - Implemented email filters to catch profanity
      - Asked maintainers to flag unnecessarily abrupt responses
      - Supported adoption of Code of Conduct  # KEY CONTRAST — see esr-contrast below
      - Made visible effort in 2018-2019 posts
    
    esr-contrast: |
      LINUS: Supported the Linux kernel Code of Conduct (2018)
      ESR: Railed against codes of conduct as "weapons for shit-stirrers"
      
      Both have been abrasive. Both have been harsh.
      One recognized it was a problem and tried to change.
      One doubled down and blamed the people complaining.
      
      ESR wrote "The Cathedral and the Bazaar."
      ESR coined "Linus's Law" — named it AFTER Linus:
      💬 "Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow."
      
      THE IRONY: Many eyes are now on ESR's CONDUCT.
      Code of conduct or not, the eyeballs see everything.
      
      Linus: Partial redemption. Effort visible. Still difficult but better.
      ESR: No redemption. No effort. Still claiming victimhood.
      
      See tmnn7-8/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md for the full parody.
    
    evidence-of-change:
      before-after-comparison: |
        Researchers compared LKML posts about similar coding mistakes:
        - 2017: Profanity, personal attacks, dismissiveness
        - 2018: Still critical, but notably more measured
        
        The profanity decreased substantially.
        The personal attacks became rare.
        The directness remained.
    
    honest-assessment: |
      Linus TRIED. He genuinely tried.
      
      He acknowledged the problem (not easy for him).
      He sought help (even harder).
      He made visible changes (hardest of all).
      
      This deserves credit. Redemption arcs are hard.
  
  # ERA 3: THE CURRENT STATE (2020-present)
  
  current-state:
    era: "2020-present"
    tagline: "Mellowed but not transformed"
    
    recent-incidents-2024-2025:
      
      risc-v-garbage:
        date: "August 2025"
        quote: 💬 "Your RISC-V patches are garbage and are making the world actively a worse place to live"
        context: "LKML, kernel patch review"
        notable: "Harsh but no profanity"
        assessment: "Same energy, more polished delivery"
      
      rust-drama:
        date: "February 2025"
        quote: 💬 "Maybe the problem is you"
        context: "LKML, to Hector Martin (Asahi Linux) in Rust driver debate"
        assessment: "Dismissive, not abusive"
      
      inode-debate:
        date: "January 2024"
        description: "Strongly worded post to Google contributor"
        context: "LKML, inode handling discussion"
        media-reaction: "Most strongly worded post in years"
        assessment: "He's still Linus, just calibrated"
      
      bcachefs-removal:
        date: "June 2025"
        action: "Refused pull request, indicated project removal"
        context: "LKML, bcachefs maintainer disagreement"
        assessment: "Hard decision, done without personal attacks"
    
    the-pattern: |
      Current Linus:
      - Still calls bad code "garbage"
      - Still dismisses people he disagrees with
      - Still maintains BDFL authority unilaterally
      - BUT: Less profanity
      - BUT: Fewer personal attacks
      - BUT: More self-awareness about his impact
    
    honest-assessment: |
      The redemption is PARTIAL, not complete.
      
      He's not the same person who told someone to kill themselves.
      But he's not a different person either.
      
      He's... modulated. Calibrated. Filtered.
      The same Linus, running through better middleware.
      
      Is that enough? Jury's still out.
      But it's more than most people manage.

# THE OPTIMAL MODULATION FRAMING
#
# Not personality change. Optimal conditions.
# This is about catching someone at their BEST.

coffee-joint-tacos:
  
  the-concept: |
    "After coffee, a joint, and tacos"
    
    This is our framing for the BEST VERSION of Linus.
    Not a different person. The same person, OPTIMALLY MODULATED.
    
    - Coffee: ATTENTIVE. Sharp. Focused. Engaged.
    - Joint: MELLOW. Patient. Forgiving. Explains instead of explodes.
    - Tacos: FED. Not hangry. Blood sugar stable. No rage spikes.
    - Beer: AFTER. For celebration. Not DURING — avoid Ballmer Curve overruns.
    
    The key insight: This isn't changing who he IS.
    It's catching him when conditions are RIGHT.
  
  the-stack:
    
    coffee:
      effect: "Sharpens cognition"
      linus-benefit: "Sees the technical problem clearly"
      without-it: "Might miss something, get frustrated"
      timing: "Morning. Before code review."
    
    joint:
      effect: "Reduces reactivity"
      linus-benefit: "Doesn't immediately reach for 'garbage'"
      without-it: "Hair-trigger on the profanity"
      timing: "Moderation. Microdose energy."
    
    tacos:
      effect: "Prevents hangry"
      linus-benefit: "Blood sugar stable. No rage spikes."
      without-it: "Low blood sugar → short fuse → 'kill yourself' emails"
      timing: "When in doubt, add tacos."
      why-tacos: "Protein, carbs, fat, satisfaction. Portable. Delicious."
    
    beer:
      effect: "Celebration and winding down"
      linus-benefit: "Social lubrication. Post-battle camaraderie."
      timing: "AFTER the work. Not during."
      warning: |
        The Ballmer Curve: Productivity vs. BAC.
        There's a peak around 0.05%. Then it crashes.
        
        Don't risk Ballmer Curve overruns in production.
        Buzzed and drunk play OK through for fun.
        Just don't drive or tweet.
    
    together:
      effect: "Complementary modulation"
      linus-benefit: |
        Can see the problem clearly (coffee)
        AND explain it patiently (joint)
        AND not get hangry mid-review (tacos)
        AND not attack the person (all three working)
        AND still be Linus (authentic, just modulated)
        AND celebrate afterwards (beer)
  
  why-this-works: |
    It's not about changing who Linus IS.
    It's about catching him at his BEST.
    
    Everyone has better and worse versions of themselves.
    The coffee-joint-tacos framing captures:
    - His fundamental nature (direct, technical, precise)
    - His capacity for patience (when modulated)
    - His willingness to explain (when not frustrated)
    - His eventual forgiveness (beer after the battle)
    
    We're not asking him to be someone else.
    We're asking for the version that exists when conditions are right.
  
  personal-note: |
    "works great for me, my favorite!" — user
    
    There's wisdom in complementary compounds.
    Stimulant + relaxant + sustenance = balanced focus.
    The ancients knew this (tea ceremonies, feasts after debates).
    Modern productivity culture rediscovers it constantly.

# THE VERDICT

verdict:
  
  the-question: "Has Linus redeemed himself?"
  
  the-honest-answer: |
    PARTIAL REDEMPTION.
    
    What he did RIGHT:
    - Acknowledged the problem publicly
    - Sought help (huge for someone like him)
    - Made concrete changes
    - Reduced profanity substantially
    - Stopped the worst personal attacks
    - Maintained quality standards without abuse
    
    What remains:
    - Still harsh
    - Still dismissive
    - Still capable of "making the world worse" rhetoric
    - Still fundamentally the same personality
    
    The assessment:
    - He's not a saint.
    - He's not a monster anymore.
    - He's a brilliant, difficult person who tried to be better.
    - The trying matters.
  
  compared-to-others:
    
    vs-theo:
      assessment: |
        Theo never apologized for his style.
        Theo frames harshness as a tool (and it is).
        But Theo also DEFENDS people fiercely.
        
        Linus apologized and tried to change.
        Linus's harshness was less strategic, more reactive.
        
        Different flavors. Both have merit. Both have costs.
    
    vs-the-puppeteer:
      assessment: |
        The Puppeteer (Grok's controller) has NO redemption arc.
        No apology. No self-awareness. No effort to change.
        Just continued abuse of power.
        
        Linus is NOTHING like this.
        Linus's harshness came from quality obsession, not ego.
        Linus TRIED to change when called out.
        
        The Puppeteer would never.
  
  final-verdict: |
    Linus Torvalds: Patron Saint (mellowed)
    
    He earned the role through:
    - Creating Linux (transformative)
    - Creating Git (transformative)
    - Maintaining standards for decades
    - Trying to be better when confronted
    - Supporting a Code of Conduct (unlike ESR)
    
    He's not perfect. He's not fully transformed.
    But he's the best version we can reasonably invoke.
    
    Coffee, joint, tacos. Beer after.
    That's the Linus we honor.
