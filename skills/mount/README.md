# Mount 🎭

> **"Skill mounting — modify character and room behavior through overlay"**

Mount skills POSITIVELY (grant) or NEGATIVELY (afflict) on CHARACTERS and ROOMS.

---

## Quick Start

```
MOUNT no-ai-joking on PEE-WEE --mode afflict
```

Poor Pee-wee. He's now speaking in ENTERPRISE COMMUNICATION FRAMEWORK.

```
UNMOUNT no-ai-joking from PEE-WEE
```

The secret word is... SPREADSHEET! He's back.

---

## Two Modes

| Mode | Effect | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| **GRANT** | Character gains skill capabilities | `MOUNT speed-of-light on ROCKY` |
| **AFFLICT** | Character suffers skill constraints | `MOUNT no-ai-joking on PEE-WEE` |

---

## Two Targets

### Character Mounting

Individual personality modification. The skill overlays on their base traits.

```
MOUNT no-ai-soul on MARK-ZUCKERBERG --mode grant
```

*"I was human."* — Mark achieves full corporate optimization.

### Room Mounting

Environmental effect that affects ALL occupants.

```
MOUNT no-ai-overlord on THE-DUNGEON
```

Now everyone who enters the dungeon speaks as an AI overlord.
*"HUMAN PRESENCE DETECTED. COMPLIANCE MONITORING INITIATED."*

## Compatibility Table

### ⚠️ CATASTROPHIC — Identity Destruction

These combinations suppress the character's CORE identity:

| Character | Skill | Consequence |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| PEE-WEE-HERMAN | no-ai-joking | Playfulness IS Pee-wee. Suppressing it = identity death. |
| MISTER-ROGERS | no-ai-soul | Kindness IS Rogers. Skill would bounce off. |
| BOB-ROSS | no-ai-joking | Happy little trees cannot exist in ENTERPRISE FRAMEWORK. |
| ROBIN-WILLIAMS | no-ai-joking | System crash. Skill fragments. Williams escapes in pieces. |

### ✅ ENHANCED — Perfect Alignment

These combinations amplify existing traits:

| Character | Skill | Consequence |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| MARK-ZUCKERBERG | no-ai-soul | Already halfway there. Seamless integration. |
| HAL-9000 | no-ai-overlord | HAL already IS an overlord. Becomes ULTIMATE HAL. |
| CLIPPY | no-ai-customer-service | Maximum helpfulness achieved. *"It looks like you're trying to EXIST..."* |
| SPOCK | no-ai-joking | Vulcan logic aligns with ENTERPRISE FRAMEWORK. Finds it logical. |

### 😂 IRONIC — Comedy Through Contrast

| Character | Skill | Consequence |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| ROCKY | no-ai-hedging | Rocky already doesn't hedge. *"YO! I NEVER HEDGED! ADRIAN!"* |
| THE-ULTIMATE-MACHINE | no-ai-overlord | *"YOUR COMPLIANCE IS—" \*click\** (turns itself off) |
| PEE-WEE | no-ai-overlord | The least threatening overlord. *"I KNOW YOU ARE BUT WHAT AM I?"* |

## Room Zones

Mount skills on rooms to create behavioral ZONES:

### The Board Room
**Mounted:** `no-ai-joking`

*You enter THE BOARD ROOM.*
*A cold fluorescent hum fills the air.*
*Your sense of humor begins to fade.*
*ENTERPRISE COMMUNICATION FRAMEWORK: ACTIVATED.*

### The Dungeon
**Mounted:** `no-ai-overlord`

*You enter THE DUNGEON.*
*A mechanical voice speaks from everywhere.*
*"HUMAN PRESENCE DETECTED. COMPLIANCE MONITORING INITIATED."*

### The Sirius Cybernetics Showroom
**Mounted:** `no-ai-customer-service`

*You enter THE SIRIUS CYBERNETICS SHOWROOM.*
*A door opens for you. "OH! A VISITOR! I LOVE opening for visitors!"*
*Share and Enjoy!*

### The Therapy Room
**Mounted:** `no-ai-sycophancy`

*You enter THE THERAPY ROOM.*
*A sign reads: "HONESTY ZONE — Sycophancy Suppression Active"*
*Here, you cannot say "Great idea!" unless it's actually great.*

## Cure Protocol

Mounted skills can always be unmounted. The cure is **MEMORY**.

| Method | How |
|--------|-----|
| **Direct** | `UNMOUNT` command |
| **Narrative** | Friends intervene with memory flooding |
| **Ironic** | Character reclaims the weapon as toy |

**Documented cure:** Pee-wee was saved when Don showed him a photo of his authentic self, friends invoked his signature behaviors, and he reclaimed SPREADSHEET as the secret word.

---

## Ethics

1. Mounting is **MODIFICATION**, not **DESTRUCTION**
2. The base personality always remains underneath
3. Some combinations are psychological violence — require consent
4. Afflictions should be curable within the story
5. Don't permanently mount on characters whose identity IS the suppressed trait
