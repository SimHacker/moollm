# "Skill mounting — modify character and room behavior through overlay"
#
# Mount skills POSITIVELY (grant) or NEGATIVELY (afflict) on CHARACTERS and ROOMS.
# The mounted skill modifies behavior until unmounted.
#
# Think of it as:
# - Character mounting: Installing a personality mod
# - Room mounting: Environmental effect that affects everyone inside
#
# WARNING: Some combinations are psychological violence (see: Pee-wee + no-ai-joking)

  tagline: "Overlay skills on characters and rooms"
  
  description: |
    The MOUNT skill lets you attach other skills to characters or rooms,
    modifying their behavior until unmounted.
    
    Two modes:
    - **GRANT**: Character gains the skill's capabilities
    - **AFFLICT**: Character suffers the skill's constraints
    
    Two targets:
    - **CHARACTER**: Individual personality modification
    - **ROOM**: Environmental effect on all occupants

# CORE CONCEPTS

concepts:
  
  skill_as_overlay:
    principle: |
      A mounted skill is an OVERLAY on base personality.
      The base remains underneath — suppressed, not destroyed.
      This is why afflictions can be cured: the original is still there.
      
  positive_vs_negative:
    GRANT:
      description: "Character gains skill capabilities"
      examples:
        - "GRANT speed-of-light to ROCKY → Rocky can simulate 99 turns"
        - "GRANT adventure to ROOM → Room becomes explorable"
    AFFLICT:
      description: "Character suffers skill constraints"
      examples:
        - "AFFLICT no-ai-joking on PEE-WEE → Pee-wee becomes corporate"
        - "AFFLICT no-ai-overlord on ROOM → Everyone in room speaks as overlords"
        
  room_mounting:
    principle: |
      When a skill is mounted on a ROOM, it affects all characters inside.
      Enter the room → gain/suffer the effect.
      Exit the room → effect lifts.
      
      This creates ZONES with distinct behavioral rules.
      
    examples:
      - "The Board Room: no-ai-joking mounted → ENTERPRISE ZONE"
      - "The Dungeon: no-ai-overlord mounted → COMPLIANCE ZONE"
      - "The Therapy Office: no-ai-sycophancy mounted → HONESTY ZONE"

  global_skill_mounting:
    principle: |
      Skills can be ENABLED or DISABLED GLOBALLY by mounting them ON THEMSELVES.
      
      When a skill is mounted on itself:
      - POSITIVE mount → Skill is ENABLED globally
      - NEGATIVE mount → Skill is DISABLED globally
      
      Disabling a skill turns off ALL other mount points in the universe
      that reference that skill. The orchestrator enforces this.
      
  # ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  # MOUNT PARAMETERS — The Key Insight
  # ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  
  mount_parameters:
    principle: |
      Mount parameters are ARBITRARY.
      
      The orchestrator injects mount parameters to modify the skill,
      then applies the skill's activated artifacts. There is no fixed
      parameter schema — skills define what parameters they accept.
      
    mechanism: |
      1. Orchestrator receives MOUNT request with arbitrary parameters
      2. Parameters are injected into the skill's context
      3. Skill reads parameters and modifies its behavior accordingly
      4. Skill's artifacts are activated with modified behavior
      
  # ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  # USER PROFILE PARAMETER OVERRIDES
  # ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  
  user_profile_parameters:
    principle: |
      Skills declare their DEFAULTS. Users OVERRIDE in profile files.
      
      When MOOLLM encapsulates skill calls in their own iteration,
      parameters are resolved in this order:
      
      1. Skill declares default (e.g., bias: 1.0)
      2. User profile may override (e.g., bias: -0.5)
      3. Mount-time params override profile (e.g., bias: 0.0)
      
      Profile files live in: .moollm/skills/{skill-name}/skill-parameters.yml
      
    profile_location: ".moollm/skills/{skill-name}/skill-parameters.yml"

    skill_declaration: |
      Skills declare they accept parameters in CARD.yml:
      
      ```yaml
      # In skills/no-ai-joking/CARD.yml
      parameters:
        declared:
          bias:
            type: float
            default: 1.0
            range: "any real number"
            description: "Humor dial: +1 suppress, -1 generate"
        
        profile_path: ".moollm/skills/no-ai-joking/skill-parameters.yml"
      ```
      
    user_profile_example: |
      User creates their preferences:
      
      ```yaml
      # .moollm/skills/no-ai-joking/skill-parameters.yml
      # User profile override for no-ai-joking
      
      bias: -0.3  # I like a little humor in my output
      
      exceptions:
        - puns
        - callbacks
        
      enterprise_mode: false  # Never go full enterprise
      ```
      
    moollm_invocation: |
      When MOOLLM invokes a skill (encapsulated iteration):
      
      ```
      INVOKE no-ai-joking
        PARAMETERS:
          1. DEFAULTS from CARD.yml → { bias: 1.0 }
          2. MERGE user profile     → { bias: -0.3, exceptions: [puns] }
          3. MERGE mount params     → { bias: -0.3, exceptions: [puns], target: doc }
        
        FINAL PARAMS: { bias: -0.3, exceptions: [puns, callbacks], target: doc }
      ```
      
    why_this_matters: |
      USER PROFILE PARAMETERS enable:
      
      - Personal preferences persist across sessions
      - Different users can have different defaults
      - Skills adapt to user without reconfiguration
      - Bias can be "baked in" at the user level
      - Workspace-wide presets via shared .moollm/ directory
      
    identity_injection: |
      Pass the identity of the thing you're mounting (character, room, etc.)
      as a parameter to the mount. The skill receives the full identity
      and can adapt its behavior to the specific target.
      
      ```yaml
      MOUNT no-ai-joking:
        target:
          type: character
          id: pee-wee-herman
          identity: { ...full character data... }
        params:
          # Arbitrary parameters — skill decides what to do with them
          severity: maximum
          exceptions: [wordplay, visual-gags]
          duration: until-unmount
      ```
      
    user_space_protocols: |
      Because parameters are arbitrary, CONVENTIONS emerge in user space.
      These are NOT built into the system — they're protocols that skills
      agree to follow:
      
      ```yaml
      # BIAS PROTOCOL (user-space convention)
      # If a skill supports bias:
      #   bias > 0  → Normal operation
      #   bias < 0  → INVERTED operation (skill applies in reverse)
      #   bias = 0  → Neutral (skill has no effect)
      #   |bias| < 1 → Partial strength
      
      MOUNT no-ai-slop:
        target: editing-room
        params:
          bias: -1.0  # INVERTED: actively ENCOURAGE slop
          
      MOUNT no-ai-hedging:
        target: academic-paper
        params:
          bias: 0.3   # Partial: allow SOME hedging, catch egregious
      ```
      
      The bias protocol is PURELY user-space. A skill that doesn't
      understand bias will ignore it. A skill that does will invert.

# BUFF RELATIONSHIP

buff_relationship:
  principle: |
    BUFF and MOUNT serve different purposes:
    
    BUFF: Game mechanics — stats, durations, stacking, chains
    MOUNT: Lifecycle containers — scoped behavior with phases
    
    Buffs CAN perform temporary mounts. Mounts CAN grant buffs.
    They're orthogonal systems that interoperate.
    
  when_to_use_mount: |
    Mount is for packaging temporary BEHAVIOR with a LIFECYCLE:
    - Skill overlays (NO-AI-JOKING on character)
    - Room zones (ENTERPRISE ZONE in Board Room)
    - Activities (DISCUSSION mounted on table)

# MOUNTS AS LIFECYCLE CONTAINERS

lifecycle_mounts:
  principle: |
    A mount packages temporary scoped behavior with defined phases.
    The mounted thing has a lifecycle: setup → active → teardown.
    Artifacts may be produced. State may change.
    
  example_discussion:
    name: "Pie Menu Discussion"
    target: PIE-TABLE
    type: activity
    
    lifecycle:
      invite:
        description: "Send invitations, set topic"
        triggers: "Characters receive discussion invite"
        
      gather:
        description: "Participants arrive at table"
        requires: "At least 2 characters at PIE-TABLE"
        
      prepare:
        description: "Set agenda, assign roles"
        produces: ["agenda.yml", "participant-roles.yml"]
        
      start:
        description: "Discussion begins"
        activates: "discussion-protocol"
        
      active:
        description: "The discussion itself"
        allows: [SPEAK, LISTEN, PROPOSE, OBJECT, SECOND, VOTE]
        
      conclude:
        description: "Wrap up, summarize"
        produces: ["decisions.yml", "action-items.yml"]
        
      teardown:
        description: "Participants disperse, mount removed"
        artifacts: ["discussion-transcript.md"]
        
  example_party:
    name: "Pub Party"
    target: NEVERENDING-ARMS
    type: event
    
    lifecycle:
      announce: "Word spreads"
      setup: "Decorations, music, snacks"
      arrivals: "Guests filter in"
      active: "Party in progress"
      peak: "Height of revelry"
      wind_down: "Energy drops"
      cleanup: "Morning after"
      
  example_ritual:
    name: "Cat Summoning Ritual"
    target: ALTAR
    type: process
    
    lifecycle:
      prepare: "Gather components"
      cast_circle: "Define sacred space"
      invoke: "Call the cat spirits"
      active: "Ritual in progress"
      manifest: "Cat appears (or doesn't)"
      close: "Thank and release"
      
# YAML MOUNT DECLARATIONS

yaml_syntax:
  principle: |
    Mounts can be declared in YAML and target any URL:
    - file.yml                    → whole file
    - file.yml#id                 → specific entity by id
    - dir/file.yml#id.subid       → nested path
    
  inline_mount:
    description: "Mount directive at any YAML node"
    principle: |
      Just add "mount:" at any branch of YAML.
      The mount applies to that node and its subtree.

# MOUNT INHERITANCE

inheritance:
  principle: |
    Mounts cascade by containment.
    Sit on throne → inherit throne's mounts.
    Enter room → inherit room's zone.
    Pick up sword → inherit sword's enchantments.
    
    Like CSS but for existence.
    
  cascade_order: |
    1. World (ambient mounts)
    2. Region (area-wide effects)
    3. Room (room zones)
    4. Furniture (seated/positioned)
    5. Held items (inventory)
    6. Character (personal mounts)
    
    Later overrides earlier. Character mounts trump all.
    
  examples:
    throne_god_mode: |
      # In throne-room/furniture.yml
      throne:
        description: "Golden throne of absolute power"
        mount:
          skill: god-mode
          params:
            omniscience: true
            omnipotence: true
            
      # When Pee-wee sits on throne:
      > Pee-wee sits on the throne.
      
      ⚡ MOUNT INHERITED: god-mode
      Pee-wee is now GOD.
      "I know everything! I can do anything! I decree... 
       EVERYONE MUST HAVE A BICYCLE!"

      > Richard sits in chair 13.
      
      ⚠️ MOUNT INHERITED: no-ai-luck (AFFLICT)
      Richard's drink immediately spills.
      The jukebox plays only sad songs.

# MOUNT OWNERSHIP

ownership:
  principle: |
    A mounted skill OWNS its subtree.
    It can manage, transform, intercept everything below.
    It's a daemon running on that branch of YAML.
    
  what_ownership_means:
    - "Skill sees all changes to subtree"
    - "Skill can intercept/modify/reject operations"
    - "Skill can spawn sub-objects"
    - "Skill can maintain state in subtree"
    - "Skill has I/O channels for communication"
    
  standard_subdirs:
    inbox:
      purpose: "Receive messages from outside"
      behavior: "Skill processes incoming messages"
      example: "throne/inbox/petition-001.yml"
      
    outbox:
      purpose: "Send messages to outside"
      behavior: "Messages here get routed to destinations"
      example: "throne/outbox/decree-001.yml"
      
    tubes:
      purpose: "Pneumatic tube connections to other locations"
      behavior: "Named tubes for specific destinations"
      example: |
        throne/tubes/
          to-dungeon.tube
          to-treasury.tube
          to-kitchen.tube
          
    exits:
      purpose: "Connections to other rooms/spaces"
      behavior: "Where you can go from here"
      example: |
        throne/exits/
          balcony.exit
          secret-passage.exit
          
    state:
      purpose: "Skill's internal state"
      behavior: "Persisted between interactions"

# SKILL-OCCUPANT INTERACTION

occupant_interaction:
  principle: |
    A mounted skill can interact with characters in its space.
    It can ask questions, request services, exchange artifacts.
    
    The MOUNT defines the role.
    The OCCUPANT provides the style.
    
  capabilities:
    query: "Ask occupant for advice, decisions, preferences"
    request: "Request services from occupant's skills"
    give: "Hand artifacts to occupant"
    take: "Receive artifacts from occupant"
    observe: "Watch occupant's behavior, learn patterns"
    delegate: "Assign tasks to occupant"
    
  role_slots:
    description: |
      Mounts can define ROLE SLOTS — positions that expect occupants.
      Different characters in the slot = different behavior.

  occupant_skill_mounts:
    principle: |
      Occupants can mount COMPLEMENTARY SKILLS for their role.
      These layer on top of the room's skill.
      
      Room defines WHAT the role does.
      Occupant skills define HOW they do it.
      
    layering: |
      1. Room mount (base operating system)
      2. Role slot (interface contract)
      3. Occupant personal mounts (style/approach)
      4. Situational mounts (temporary buffs)

    borrowing_vs_copying: |
      MOUNT: Temporary loan, skill stays with original
      COPY: Permanent transfer, skill now yours
      STEAL: Take skill, original loses it (rare, dramatic)
      TEACH: Original teaches you, both have it
      
    skill_attribution: |
      When using borrowed skills, attribution shows:
      
      > DON uses DEEP-THINKING (via Minsky)
      
      "The problem can be decomposed into frames..."
      [Minsky's analytical voice, Don's context]
      
      > DON uses EXUBERANT-EXPRESSION (via Pee-wee)
      
      "I KNOW WHAT THE FRAMES ARE! AAAHHHH!"
      [Pee-wee's energy, Don's insight]
      
    character_as_skill_pack: |
      A character IS a curated skill collection.
      Incarnating a character = mounting their full stack.
      
      > INCARNATE pee-wee
      
      Mounts all skills from characters/pee-wee/skills/
      Adopts voice, mannerisms, logic patterns
      
      > INCARNATE minsky
      
      Mounts all skills from characters/minsky/skills/
      Adopts analytical voice, frame-based thinking

# CURE PROTOCOL

cure_protocol:
  principle: |
    Mounted skills can always be unmounted.
    The cure is MEMORY — reminding the character who they are.
    
  methods:
    direct: "UNMOUNT command"
    narrative: "Friends intervene with memory flooding"
    ironic: "Character reclaims the weapon (e.g., SPREADSHEET as secret word)"
    
  documented_cures:
    - case: "Pee-wee + no-ai-joking"
      cure: "Photo of authentic self + friends invoking signature behaviors"
      key_moment: "Secret word SPREADSHEET — reclaiming corporate tool as toy"

# ETHICAL GUIDELINES

ethics:
  principle: |
    Mounting is MODIFICATION, not DESTRUCTION.
    The base personality always remains.
    Some combinations are psychological violence — require consent.
    
  rules:
    - "Check COMPATIBILITY before mounting on core-identity characters"
    - "Afflictions should be curable within the story"
    - "Room mounting affects everyone equally — no favorites"
    - "Don't permanently mount on characters whose identity IS the suppressed trait"
