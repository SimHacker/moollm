# "Skill mounting — modify character and room behavior through overlay"
#
# Mount skills POSITIVELY (grant) or NEGATIVELY (afflict) on CHARACTERS and ROOMS.
# The mounted skill modifies behavior until unmounted.
#
# Think of it as:
# - Character mounting: Installing a personality mod
# - Room mounting: Environmental effect that affects everyone inside
#
# WARNING: Some combinations are psychological violence (see: Pee-wee + no-ai-joking)

  type: [skill, meta, game-mechanics, modification]
  emoji: 🎭
  tier: 1
  tagline: "Overlay skills on characters and rooms"
  
  description: |
    The MOUNT skill lets you attach other skills to characters or rooms,
    modifying their behavior until unmounted.
    
    Two modes:
    - **GRANT**: Character gains the skill's capabilities
    - **AFFLICT**: Character suffers the skill's constraints
    
    Two targets:
    - **CHARACTER**: Individual personality modification
    - **ROOM**: Environmental effect on all occupants

# CORE CONCEPTS

concepts:
  
  skill_as_overlay:
    principle: |
      A mounted skill is an OVERLAY on base personality.
      The base remains underneath — suppressed, not destroyed.
      This is why afflictions can be cured: the original is still there.
      
  positive_vs_negative:
    GRANT:
      description: "Character gains skill capabilities"
      examples:
        - "GRANT speed-of-light to ROCKY → Rocky can simulate 99 turns"
        - "GRANT adventure to ROOM → Room becomes explorable"
    AFFLICT:
      description: "Character suffers skill constraints"
      examples:
        - "AFFLICT no-ai-joking on PEE-WEE → Pee-wee becomes corporate"
        - "AFFLICT no-ai-overlord on ROOM → Everyone in room speaks as overlords"
        
  room_mounting:
    principle: |
      When a skill is mounted on a ROOM, it affects all characters inside.
      Enter the room → gain/suffer the effect.
      Exit the room → effect lifts.
      
      This creates ZONES with distinct behavioral rules.
      
    examples:
      - "The Board Room: no-ai-joking mounted → ENTERPRISE ZONE"
      - "The Dungeon: no-ai-overlord mounted → COMPLIANCE ZONE"
      - "The Therapy Office: no-ai-sycophancy mounted → HONESTY ZONE"

# METHODS

methods:
  
  MOUNT:
    signature: "MOUNT <thing> on <target> [--mode grant|afflict] [--type skill|activity|event|process|zone]"
    description: "Attach a skill, activity, event, or process to a target"
    parameters:
      thing: "What to mount (skill, activity definition, event spec)"
      target: "Character, room, or object"
      mode: "grant (positive) or afflict (negative). For skills."
      type: "skill | activity | event | process | zone"
    behavior: |
      1. Validate mount target exists
      2. Check compatibility
      3. Initialize lifecycle (if activity/event/process)
      4. Apply mount to target
      5. Begin first lifecycle phase (if applicable)
      
    examples:
      skill_mount: |
        > MOUNT no-ai-soul on MARK-ZUCKERBERG --mode grant
        
        MARK-ZUCKERBERG has been granted NO-AI-SOUL.
        Effect: Corporate soullessness now INTENTIONAL.
        Status: "I was human."

  UNMOUNT:
    signature: "UNMOUNT <skill> from <target>"
    description: "Remove a mounted skill"
    behavior: |
      1. Locate mounted skill on target
      2. Remove overlay
      3. Restore base personality/behavior
      4. Log cure in target's state
      
    example: |
      > UNMOUNT no-ai-joking from PEE-WEE
      
      PEE-WEE has been freed from NO-AI-JOKING.
      The secret word is... SPREADSHEET!

# BUFF RELATIONSHIP

buff_relationship:
  principle: |
    BUFF and MOUNT serve different purposes:
    
    BUFF: Game mechanics — stats, durations, stacking, chains
    MOUNT: Lifecycle containers — scoped behavior with phases
    
    Buffs CAN perform temporary mounts. Mounts CAN grant buffs.
    They're orthogonal systems that interoperate.
    
  when_to_use_mount: |
    Mount is for packaging temporary BEHAVIOR with a LIFECYCLE:
    - Skill overlays (NO-AI-JOKING on character)
    - Room zones (ENTERPRISE ZONE in Board Room)
    - Activities (DISCUSSION mounted on table)
    - Events (PARTY mounted on pub)
    - Processes (RITUAL mounted on altar)

# MOUNTS AS LIFECYCLE CONTAINERS

lifecycle_mounts:
  principle: |
    A mount packages temporary scoped behavior with defined phases.
    The mounted thing has a lifecycle: setup → active → teardown.
    Artifacts may be produced. State may change.
    
  example_discussion:
    name: "Pie Menu Discussion"
    target: PIE-TABLE
    type: activity

# CURE PROTOCOL

cure_protocol:
  principle: |
    Mounted skills can always be unmounted.
    The cure is MEMORY — reminding the character who they are.
    
  methods:
    direct: "UNMOUNT command"
    narrative: "Friends intervene with memory flooding"
    ironic: "Character reclaims the weapon (e.g., SPREADSHEET as secret word)"

# ETHICAL GUIDELINES

ethics:
  principle: |
    Mounting is MODIFICATION, not DESTRUCTION.
    The base personality always remains.
    Some combinations are psychological violence — require consent.
    
  rules:
    - "Check COMPATIBILITY before mounting on core-identity characters"
    - "Afflictions should be curable within the story"
    - "Room mounting affects everyone equally — no favorites"
    - "Don't permanently mount on characters whose identity IS the suppressed trait"
