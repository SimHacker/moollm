what: |
  Sims-style object interaction. Objects broadcast available actions.
  Scored by relevance. Plug-in architecture.
  This is how The Sims enabled infinite expansion.

why: |
  - Objects self-describe (no code changes)
  - Autonomous agents select best actions
  - Needs modulate scores
  - Infinite expansion via new objects

when:
  - "New room, unsure what to do" → SCAN
  - "Creating interactive object" → add advertisements
  - "Understanding Sims pattern" → EVALUATE

methods:
  SCAN: "Collect all ads from current room"
  SHOW: "Display object's advertisements"
  SELECT: "Choose an advertised action"
  EVALUATE: "Score ads against character needs"

ad_schema:
  action: "Action name"
  description: "What it does"
  score: "Base priority (0-100)"
  score_if: "Conditional modifier"
  preconditions: "What must be true"
  satisfies: "Needs/goals fulfilled"

ambient_advertisement: |
  Special type for "in the air" skills:
  AMBIENT:
    score: 100
    condition: always
    scope: [session, conversation, room, card-only]
    resolution: [full, summary, sniff, card-only]

sims_insight: |
  Why it worked:
  - User-created objects
  - Expansion packs drop in
  - No code changes needed
  - Community millions of objects

pie_menu: "Ads become pie menu slices, sorted by score"
score_dynamics: "Base + score_if + needs + context"
lineage: [Will Wright (The Sims), Don Hopkins (Pie Menus)]
tier: 1
