# 🔀 "Kilroy-style data flow in the filesystem."

what: |
  Rooms as processing nodes. Exits as edges.
  Objects THROWN through exits are messages.
  Build Factorio-like pipelines in adventure world.

why: |
  - Factory-style processing in rooms
  - Visual workflows you can walk through
  - Objects transform as they flow
  - Bottlenecks become inspectable

when:
  - '"Process data through stages" → PIPELINE'
  - '"Route objects between rooms" → THROW, CONNECT'
  - '"Transform objects at nodes" → room on_receive'

methods:
  THROW: "Send object through exit"
  RECEIVE: "Process incoming objects from inbox"
  CONNECT: "Create data flow edge"
  PIPELINE: "Define multi-stage processing"

pattern:
  rooms: "Processing nodes"
  exits: "Edges in graph"
  objects: "Messages flowing through"
  inbox: "Where incoming land"
  outbox: "Where processed wait"

pipeline_example: |
  mixing-room (ingredients) 
    → oven-room (dough) 
    → packaging-room (cookies)

state:
  room_inbox: "Objects waiting to be processed"
  room_outbox: "Objects ready to send"

lineage: [Kilroy, Factorio, Unix pipes]
insight: "The filesystem becomes a factory you can walk through"
tier: 1
