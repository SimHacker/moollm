# 👤 "Actually exists — respect the reality"

what: |
  Ontological tag for entities that actually exist.
  They have life, experiences, rights independent of imagination.
  We portray them, not create them.

why: |
  - Highest ethical weight
  - Requires HERO-STORY protocol
  - Consent for intimate portrayal
  - Can't fabricate their words

when:
  - '"Portraying real person" → PORTRAY'
  - '"Honoring someone" → TRIBUTE'
  - '"Using their words" → QUOTE (must be real, cited)'
  - '"Imagining response" → IMAGINE-RESPONSE (marked as imagination)'
