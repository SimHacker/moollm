# GLANCE.yml — inventory
# Full file: CARD.yml (341 lines) | SKILL.md
# 🎒 "Carry pointers or values. Set them down, they become real."

what: |
  Universal protocol for carrying, storing, transferring objects.
  Applies to ANY container: characters, bags, rooms, vehicles.
  Pointers (free) vs values (weight). Boxing creates identity.

why: |
  - Lightweight refs don't count against capacity
  - Deep copies have weight
  - Structural editing via pointers
  - Code becomes explorable space

when:
  - '"Pick up item" → TAKE, TAKE REF, TAKE OBJECT'
  - '"Put down item" → DROP, DROP AS BOX, DROP AS BEAM'
  - '"Edit YAML/JSON" → PEEK, POKE, SPLICE'
  - '"Move heavy object" → BEAM, TRANSPORTER'

item_types:
  pointer: "Lightweight path, weight: 0"
  value: "Direct data, weight varies"
  object: "Deep copy with identity"
  fungible: "{proto, count} — identical items stack"

pointer_syntax:
  yaml_file: "path/to/file.yml"
  yaml_nested: "file.yml#parent.child"
  md_heading: "file.md#heading-slug"
  json_path: "file.json#/path/to/field"
  line_number: "file.cpp:42"
  line_range: "file.py:10-25"

pickup_modes:
  TAKE: "Smart default"
  TAKE_REF: "Explicit pointer (light)"
  TAKE_OBJECT: "Deep copy (heavy)"

drop_modes:
  DROP_AS_BOX: "Create YAML file with inheritance"
  DROP_AS_BEAM: "Move actual file"
  DROP_INTO: "Insert into container list"

structural_editing: [PEEK, POKE, SNIP, PULL, SPLICE, APPEND, SET, DELETE]

boxing_rule: |
  pointer → YAML file with identity
  Creates: inherits, instantiated_by, instantiated_at
  Golden rule: Once boxed, always boxed.

code_as_space: "Stand on functions. Review with party. Bug markers at lines."
