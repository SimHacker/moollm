**Date:** 2026-01-28  
**Auditor:** Deep Probe  
**Verdict:** THE LLM IS THE DICE

---

## Executive Summary

**Success calculation from stats — no dice, just odds.**

The LLM doesn't roll dice — it evaluates probability and narrates an outcome.

---

## Methods

| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **CALCULATE** | Compute success probability |
| **RESOLVE** | Determine outcome based on odds |

---

## Mechanism

**No random number generators.**

The LLM evaluates probability narratively:
- Character stats
- Buffs and debuffs
- Context and stakes
- Story needs

---

## Outcomes

```
Critical success
       ↓

    Failure
       ↓
Critical failure
```

## Security Assessment

### Concerns

1. **Determinism** — no true randomness
2. **Bias** — LLM may favor dramatic outcomes

### Mitigations

- Narrative probability is feature, not bug
- Story-appropriate outcomes
- Transparent calculation

**Risk Level:** LOW — it's a design choice

---

## Verdict

**NARRATIVE PROBABILITY. APPROVE.**

The LLM is the dice.

It narrates the outcome.
