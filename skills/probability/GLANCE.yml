when:
  - '"Action with uncertain outcome" → CALCULATE + RESOLVE'

methods:
  CALCULATE: "Compute success probability"
  RESOLVE: "Determine outcome based on odds"

mechanism: |
  LLM evaluates probability narratively:
  - Character stats
  - Buffs and debuffs
  - Context and stakes
  - Story needs

outcomes:
  - "Critical success"
  - "Success"
  - "Partial"
  - "Failure"
