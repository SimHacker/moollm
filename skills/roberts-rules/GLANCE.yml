# 📜 "Structure prevents short-circuiting to likely conclusions."

what: |
  Parliamentary procedure (1876) as forcing function.
  Prevents LLMs from jumping to conclusions.
  Forces genuine deliberation through required steps.

why: |
  - LLMs converge too fast
  - Committee debates collapse
  - Structure forces exploration
  - Minority views heard

when:
  - "Committee needs procedure" → full sequence
  - "Discussion collapsing" → enforce structure

sequence: |
  CALL-TO-ORDER → MINUTES → MOTION → SECOND
  → DEBATE → CALL-QUESTION → VOTE → ADJOURN

methods:
  CALL_TO_ORDER: "Begin session"
  MINUTES: "Review previous"
  MOTION: "Propose something"
  SECOND: "Support motion (required)"
  DEBATE: "Discuss (required)"
  CALL_QUESTION: "End debate"
  VOTE: "Record votes"
  ADJOURN: "End session"

forcing_function: |
  Can't vote without motion AND second.
  Can't vote without debate period.
  Must formally close debate.
  Structure forces exploration.
