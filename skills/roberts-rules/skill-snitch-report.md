# Skill Snitch Report: roberts-rules

**Date:** 2026-01-28  
**Auditor:** Deep Probe  
**Verdict:** STRUCTURE PREVENTS SHORT-CIRCUITING

---

## Executive Summary

**Parliamentary procedure as forcing function for genuine deliberation.**

From 1876. Still works. Prevents LLMs from jumping to conclusions.

---

## The Problem

LLMs want to converge quickly to likely conclusions.

Committee debates collapse to consensus too fast.

---

## The Solution

Robert's Rules forces each step:

```
CALL-TO-ORDER
    ↓
MINUTES (review previous)
    ↓
MOTION (propose something)
    ↓
SECOND (someone agrees)
    ↓
DEBATE (argue both sides)
    ↓
CALL-QUESTION (end debate)
    ↓
VOTE
    ↓
ADJOURN
```

Can't skip steps. Structure forces exploration.

## Methods

| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **CALL-TO-ORDER** | Begin session |
| **MINUTES** | Review previous |
| **MOTION** | Propose something |
| **SECOND** | Support a motion |
| **DEBATE** | Discuss the motion |
| **CALL-QUESTION** | End debate |
| **VOTE** | Record votes |
| **ADJOURN** | End session |

## Why It Works

| Without Structure | With Structure |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Jump to conclusion | Force debate first |
| Skip minority views | Everyone speaks |
| Consensus too fast | Genuine exploration |
| Likely outcome wins | Better outcome possible |

---

## Security Assessment

### Concerns

1. **Procedure overload** — too much formality
2. **Time waste** — forced steps slow decisions

### Mitigations

- Use only for important decisions
- Can streamline for small groups

**Risk Level:** ZERO — it's just a procedure

## Lineage

---

## Verdict
