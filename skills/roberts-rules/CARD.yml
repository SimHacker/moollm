# WHY IT WORKS

forcing_function:
  problem: |
    LLMs want to converge quickly to likely conclusions.
    Committee debates collapse to consensus too fast.
    
  solution: |
    Robert's Rules forces each step:
    - Can't vote without motion AND second
    - Can't vote without debate period
    - Must formally close debate before voting
    
    Structure forces genuine exploration of the decision space.
