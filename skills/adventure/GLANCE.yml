# GLANCE.yml — adventure
# Full file: CARD.yml (722 lines) | SKILL.md
# 🗺️ "Every directory is a room. Every file is a clue."

what: |
  Text adventure pattern: directories as rooms, files as objects,
  chat as commands, LLM as dungeon master.
  Includes PSIBER (data as dungeon) and SUMMON (character instantiation).

why: |
  - Explore any filesystem as narrative space
  - Code review as adventure (hacking party on functions)
  - Edit data through natural language (PSIBER)
  - Summon characters to any location

when:
  - "Explore this codebase" → START, LOOK, GO
  - "Navigate data structure" → PSIBER-ENTER, PSIBER-LOOK
  - "Bring character here" → SUMMON
  - "Save/restore game state" → SAVE, RESTORE

exploration:
  LOOK: "See room + contents"
  GO: "n/s/e/w/up/down/in/out"
  EXAMINE: "Inspect thing in detail"
  TAKE/DROP: "Inventory management"
  TALK: "Talk to character about topic"

psiber_protocol: |
  ENTER moollm://path/to/file.yml#json.path
  Objects become rooms. Keys become doors. Values become items.
  CHANGE key TO value. ADD key. DELETE key.

summon_protocol: |
  SUMMON [character] (WITH [params]) (MODE [movement])
  Evaluates preconditions, creates runtime actor from prototype.
  DISMISS/INSULT to send away (reactions vary).

runtime_descriptions: |
  pickDescription(lod) — glance | look | examine
  Closure over world and object. State-dependent text.
  Room describes environment. Objects describe themselves.

characters_cache:
  file: CHARACTERS.yml
  purpose: "Runtime cache of all character locations"
  template: templates/CHARACTERS.yml.tmpl
  tracks: [location, party, doing, mood, goals]
  note: "Quick lookup — who's where without reading 52 files"

inherits: [simulation]
tier: 1
tools: [read_file, write_file, list_dir]
