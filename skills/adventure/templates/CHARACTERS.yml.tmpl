# CHARACTERS.yml — Runtime character cache. NO WASTED TOKENS.
# This file is read constantly. Every byte costs. Be stark.
# Enlightening comments only. No decoration.
# Characters physically nested under their party. Move when party changes.
# Journals track active output streams — don't forget to write them.
