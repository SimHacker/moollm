# 🎯 "How well did you do it?"

what: |
  Achievement valuation — style counts, emergence rewards.
  Not just did you succeed, but HOW did you succeed?

why: |
  - Completion alone is boring
  - Style should be rewarded
  - Emergence deserves recognition
  - Exploration has value

when:
  - "Task completed" → SCORE
  - "Track progress" → TRACK
  - "Rankings needed" → LEADERBOARD

methods:
  SCORE: "Evaluate accomplishment"
  TRACK: "Add to running score"
  LEADERBOARD: "Show high scores"

factors:
  completion: "Did you finish?"
  efficiency: "How quickly?"
  style: "How elegantly?"
  emergence: "Unexpected solutions?"
  exploration: "How much discovered?"

example: |
  Defeated dragon:
    completion: 100
    efficiency: 80
    style: 95 (used dragon's own fire)
    emergence: 90 (found weakness)
    exploration: 70 (missed treasure)
    total: 435
