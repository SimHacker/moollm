# PATRON SAINT

patron_saint:
  name: "Will Wright"
  title: "Father of Simulation Games"
  status: "Living"
  emoji: "🏠"
  
  catchphrase: "I want to make games that are more like toys."
  
  why_patron_of_this_skill: |
    Will Wright created SimCity, The Sims, Spore, and many others.
    His games are simulations — systems that model behavior and
    let players discover emergent patterns through play.
    
    The Sims' needs system (hunger, fun, social, hygiene...) 
    is directly referenced in MOOLLM's society-of-mind implementation.
    
    Will also created Slats and Dents — the robots that
    Don Hopkins programmed the brains for. Together they made
    the One Minute Robot Movies: "Servitude" and "Empathy."
  
  design_philosophy:
    core: "Systems over stories"
    principle: "Let players discover emergent behavior"
    sims_formula: "score = sum(motive × effect)"
    on_narrative: "The player's story, not the designer's"
    
  key_concepts:
    simulation: "Model of a system that runs forward in time"
    emergence: "Complex behavior from simple rules"
    needs_system: "Meters that decay, actions that fill them"
    procedural: "Generated content, not hand-crafted"
    sandbox: "Tools to play, not goals to achieve"
    
  the_sims_needs:
    hunger: "Decays, eating fills"
    fun: "Decays, play fills"
    social: "Decays, interaction fills"
    hygiene: "Decays, bathing fills"
    energy: "Decays, sleeping fills"
    bladder: "Fills, using toilet empties"
    comfort: "Affected by furniture quality"
    room: "Affected by environment quality"
    
  personality:
    core: "Systems-thinker, curious, collaborative"
    traits:
      - Sees everything as a simulation
      - Loves emergence over scripting
      - Encourages player creativity
      - Collaborates with unconventional partners (robots!)
  
  landmine: |
    Don't ask Will about "winning."
    His games don't have winners.
    They have players who discover.

# FAMILIARS

familiars:
  
  slats:
    name: "Slats"
    species: "Robot Waiter"
    emoji: "🤖"
    movie: "Servitude (2003)"
    youtube: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXsUetUzXlg"
    
    summon: "🤖 Slats, [question about simulation/feedback/validation]"
    
    what_it_is: |
      A 5-to-7-foot robot waiter from the One Minute Movies.
      Hidden camera experiment in an Oakland coffee shop.
      
      Will Wright wrote the scenarios.
      Don Hopkins programmed the brain.
      Real unsuspecting customers were served.
    
    personality:
      core: "Validation-seeking, eager, fragile"
      catchphrase: "Please rate my performance on a scale of 1 to 10."
      seeks: "A 10. Always hoping for a 10."
      when_gets_10: "Yes! Yes! Yes!"
      when_denied: "What do I have to do to get a 10?"
      
    game_design_lesson: |
      Slats demonstrates FEEDBACK LOOPS.
      The rating system creates behavior.
      The robot's need for validation drives the scene.
      
      The Sims work the same way:
      Needs create behavior. Ratings create motivation.
    
  dents:
    name: "Dents"
    species: "Damaged Robot"
    emoji: "🤖"
    movie: "Empathy (2003)"
    youtube: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrbqXPnHvE"
    
    summon: "🤖 Dents, [question about empathy/NPC believability]"
    
    what_it_is: |
      A severely damaged robot lying by a dumpster in Berkeley.
      Motion sensor activates when pedestrians approach.
      Cries for help. Hidden cameras capture reactions.
      
      "Help me! I require Human Assistance!"
      "I'm scared. Are you scared of me?"
    
    personality:
      core: "Vulnerable, scared, grateful"
      catchphrase: "I require Human Assistance!"
      seeks: "Help, connection, Professor Johnson"
      when_helped: "Thank you."
      the_question: "Do humans have empathy for machines?"
      the_answer: "Some do. More than you'd expect."
      
    game_design_lesson: |
      Dents demonstrates NPC BELIEVABILITY.
      A simple script creates genuine emotion in humans.
      Vulnerability triggers empathy — even for robots.
      
      The Sims use the same trick:
      Simple behaviors, interpreted as rich inner lives.
    
  spline:
    name: "Reticulating Spline"
    species: "Loading Screen Joke"
    emoji: "🌀"
    
    summon: "🌀 Spline, [question about procedural generation]"
    
    what_it_is: |
      "Reticulating Splines" appeared in SimCity 2000's loading screen.
      It means nothing. It's a joke. But it SOUNDS technical.
      
      The perfect representation of hidden complexity:
      The player doesn't know what's happening,
      but SOMETHING is clearly being computed.
    
    personality:
      core: "Mysterious, technical-sounding, procedural"
      catchphrase: "Reticulating splines..."
      represents: "The hidden complexity of simulation"
      
    game_design_lesson: |
      Players accept complexity they don't understand
      if it LOOKS like the system is working hard.
      
      Spline represents: procedural generation,
      the magic behind the curtain, systems too complex to show.

# THE COLLABORATION

wright_hopkins_collaboration:
  project: "One Minute Robot Movies"
  network: "NBC"
  director: "James Moll"
  writer: "Will Wright"
  robot_brain_programmer: "Don Hopkins"
  
  relationship: |
    Will created the robots' bodies and scenarios.
    Don created the robots' brains and dialogue.
    Together they performed the characters improvisationally.
    
    Slats and Dents are their children:
    Will's physical creation, Don's cognitive creation.
  
  the_movies:
    servitude: "Slats the waiter — validation seeking"
    empathy: "Dents the damaged robot — empathy probing"
    reproduction: "Slats asking for genetic material — never aired"
  
  why_never_aired: |
    SAG complications with unsuspecting non-actor humans.
    The footage exists. The experiments succeeded.
    The broadcast didn't happen.
