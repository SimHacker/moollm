# 🎭 "The rules ARE the argument."

what: |
  Design objects and worlds with intentional ideology.
  Ian Bogost's insight: games persuade through rules.
  The structure embodies an ideology.

why: |
  - Rules make claims
  - Systems encode values
  - Design with intention
  - Surface hidden assumptions

when:
  - "Creating system/game" → DESIGN intentionally
  - "See hidden assumptions" → ANALYZE or CRITIQUE

methods:
  ANALYZE: "What does this design argue?"
  DESIGN: "Create rules that embody an argument"
  CRITIQUE: "Surface unintentional rhetoric"

examples:
  monopoly: "Wealth accumulates — capitalism's feedback loops"
  sims_needs: "Happiness = satisfying meters — consumerist"
  moollm_filesystem: "Knowledge is spatial — directories as understanding"

design_questions: |
  What's measurable vs invisible?
  What's rewarded vs punished?
  What's possible vs impossible?
  What's easy vs hard?

bogost_insight: "Procedures can make claims about how things work."
