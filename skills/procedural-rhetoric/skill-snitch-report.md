# Skill Snitch Report: procedural-rhetoric

**Date:** 2026-01-28  
**Auditor:** Deep Probe  
**Verdict:** THE RULES ARE THE ARGUMENT

---

## Executive Summary

**Design objects and worlds with intentional ideology.**

Ian Bogost's insight: games persuade through their rules and processes.

The structure of the world embodies an ideology.

---

## The Bogost Insight

> "Procedures can make claims about how things work."

| System | What It Argues |
|--------|----------------|
| **Monopoly** | Wealth accumulates to winners — capitalism's feedback loops |
| **Sims Needs** | Happiness = satisfying meters — consumerist assumption |
| **MOOLLM Filesystem** | Knowledge is spatial — directories as understanding |

---

## Methods

| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **ANALYZE** | What does this design argue? |
| **DESIGN** | Create rules that embody an argument |
| **CRITIQUE** | Surface unintentional rhetoric |

---

## Design With Intention

Every system makes claims:
- What's measurable vs invisible
- What's rewarded vs punished
- What's possible vs impossible
- What's easy vs hard

Design intentionally.

---

## Security Assessment

### Concerns

1. **Manipulation** — hidden persuasion
2. **Unintentional ideology** — accidental messaging

### Mitigations

- ANALYZE before deploying
- CRITIQUE surfaces hidden assumptions
- Transparency about design choices

**Risk Level:** LOW — awareness is the mitigation
