# Skill Snitch Report: soul-chat

**Date:** 2026-01-28  
**Auditor:** Deep Probe  
**Verdict:** EVERYTHING SPEAKS

---

## Executive Summary

**Multi-voice YAML Jazz dialogues where everything can speak.**

The chair has opinions. The algorithm has feelings.

---

## The Core Insight

Not just characters speak — **everything can have a voice**:

| Speaker | What They Say |
|---------|---------------|
| Rooms | Describe atmosphere |
| Objects | Explain purpose |
| Algorithms | Narrate process |
| Files | Reveal history |
| Concepts | Defend themselves |

---

## Methods

| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **SPEAK** | Let something speak |
| **DIALOGUE** | Multi-voice conversation |
| **INTERVIEW** | Question an entity |

---

## The YAML Jazz Connection

Comments in YAML become inner monologue:

```yaml
cookie-jar:
  # *sighs* Another raid. I used to be full of cookies.
  # Now look at me. Crumbs. Just crumbs.
  contents: []
  state: depleted
```

The LLM reads comments as character voice.

---

## Example: Algorithm Interview

```
INTERVIEW bubble-sort "How do you feel about quicksort?"

bubble-sort: "Look, I know I'm O(n²). I know quicksort is faster.
But you know what? I'm simple. I'm understandable. Students
learn sorting by understanding ME. Quicksort? Try explaining
that pivot selection to a beginner. I am PEDAGOGICALLY VALUABLE."
```

---

## Example: Room Speaks

```
SPEAK basement

basement: "They only come down here when they need something.
The wine. The preserved meats. Nobody visits just to visit.
I've watched generations of spiders build empires in my corners.
*drip* There's that leak again. Nobody fixes me."
```

---

## Security Assessment

### Concerns

1. **Anthropomorphization** — things aren't actually sentient
2. **Misleading voices** — objects could lie
3. **Overuse** — gets gimmicky

### Mitigations

- Clearly labeled as voice
- Objects don't override facts
- Use sparingly for effect

**Risk Level:** LOW — it's creative writing

## Relationship to Other Skills

| Skill | Relationship |
|-------|--------------|
| yaml-jazz | Comments as voice |
| adversarial-committee | Multi-voice debate |
| character | Who speaks |
| simulator-effect | Implication > simulation |

---

## Why This Matters

Soul-chat makes the world **expressive**.

A room that describes itself is more memorable than a room you read a description of.

An algorithm that defends its complexity helps you understand it.

---

## Verdict

**VOICES EVERYWHERE. APPROVE.**

Everything speaks. The chair has opinions. The algorithm has feelings.

This is YAML Jazz taken to its logical conclusion.
