# 💬 "The chair has opinions. The algorithm has feelings."

what: |
  Multi-voice YAML Jazz dialogues where everything speaks.
  Characters, objects, rooms, algorithms, concepts — all have voices.
  Comments in YAML become inner monologue.

why: |
  - Make world expressive
  - Objects explain themselves
  - Multiple perspectives simultaneously
  - Algorithms can defend their complexity

when:
  - '"Let something speak" → SPEAK'
  - '"Multi-voice conversation" → DIALOGUE'
  - '"Question an entity" → INTERVIEW'

methods:
  SPEAK: "Let something speak"
  DIALOGUE: "Multi-voice conversation"
  INTERVIEW: "Question an entity"

speakers:
  rooms: "Describe atmosphere"
  objects: "Explain purpose"
  algorithms: "Narrate process"
  files: "Reveal history"
  concepts: "Defend themselves"

  cookie-jar:
    # *sighs* Another raid. Just crumbs now.
    contents: []

algorithm_interview: |
  bubble-sort: "I know I'm O(n²). But I'm PEDAGOGICALLY
  VALUABLE. Try explaining pivot selection to a beginner."

room_speaks: |
  basement: "They only come down when they need something.
  Nobody visits just to visit. *drip* That leak again."

insight: "A room that speaks is more memorable than one you read about."
