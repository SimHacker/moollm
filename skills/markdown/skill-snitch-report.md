## Executive Summary

**Plain text formatting that's readable raw AND rendered.**

No transformation gap. Markdown is readable before AND after rendering.

## Key Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Source is Destination** | Readable raw AND rendered |
| **LLM-Native** | Models trained on billions of .md files |
| **Git-Friendly** | Meaningful diffs, readable history |
| **No Lock-In** | Plain text survives every platform |

## GFM Extensions

| Extension | Use |
|-----------|-----|
| **Tables** | Data presentation |
| **Task lists** | Checkboxes |
| **Fenced code** | Syntax highlighting |
| **Collapsible** | `<details open>` for long docs |
| **Alerts** | NOTE, WARNING, etc. |
| **Mermaid** | Diagrams as code |

## Mermaid Diagram Types

| Type | Use |
|------|-----|
| **flowchart** | Process flow, decisions |

## Collapsible Pattern

```html
<summary> should tell readers what's inside WITHOUT opening

❌ <summary>Click to see more</summary>
✓ <summary><strong>🎤 Gary's Talk — Schema + LLM = Flight</strong></summary>
```
