# ⏰ "Game time is not LLM time."

what: |
  Simulation turns vs LLM iterations.
  One response can cover many turns.
  Many responses can be one turn.
  The LLM judges how time passes.

why: |
  - Buffs/needs decay by TURNS, not API calls
  - Natural language durations work
  - Simulation consistency
  - Speed controls for pacing

when:
  - "Advance simulation" → TICK
  - "Pass time" → WAIT
  - "Freeze time" → PAUSE
  - "Check time" → STATUS

distinction:
  simulation_turn: "Abstract game time — 'buffs last 5 turns'"
  llm_iteration: "One API request/response"
  independent: "These are NOT the same!"

examples:
  - "Walk N, S, E → 1 LLM call, 3 turns"
  - "Long conversation → 5 LLM calls, 1 turn"
  - "Wait until morning → 1 LLM call, many turns"

methods:
  TICK: "Advance one turn"
  WAIT: "Pass time (natural language OK)"
  PAUSE: "Freeze time"
  RESUME: "Unfreeze time"
  STATUS: "Show current time"

state:
  turn: "integer"
  time_of_day: "string"
  advancement: "[paused, slow, normal, fast]"

what_ticks:
  needs: "Decay by rate"
  buffs: "Decrement duration"
  objects: "Run simulate closures"
  mail: "Decrement transit time"

llm_judges: |
  "Wait 5 minutes" → 1-2 turns
  "Wait until morning" → many turns
  "Wait a moment" → 0 turns (flavor)
