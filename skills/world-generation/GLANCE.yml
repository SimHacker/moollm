# 🌱 "Ask about a place and it exists."

what: |
  Dynamic world creation on demand.
  Questions expand the world.
  Exploration IS creation.

why: |
  - Don't pre-generate everything
  - Generate what's needed
  - Questions create reality
  - 'Undefined → defined when observed'

when:
  - '"Exploring beyond known" → EXPAND'
  - '"Need new location" → CREATE'
  - '"Link areas" → CONNECT'
  - '"Vertical structure" → TOWER'

methods:
  CREATE: "Generate new place"
  EXPAND: "Add to existing area"
  CONNECT: "Link two areas"
  TOWER: "Generate vertical structure"
  FLOOR: "Add floor to tower"

principle: |
  "What's north?" makes north exist.
  Don't pre-generate.
  Generate on demand.

    name: "No-AI Tower"
    floors: [ground/lobby, 1/offices, 2/servers, rooftop/helipad]
