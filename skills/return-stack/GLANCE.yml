what: |
  Navigation history as first-class continuation.
  Browser back/forward for exploration.
  PLUS: Self-inspired dynamic deoptimization.

why: |
  - Track navigation history
  - Bookmark positions
  - Reconstruct causal traces
  - Debug without runtime overhead

when:
  - '"Exploring, want to backtrack" → PUSH/POP'
  - '"Bookmark this spot" → PUSH with label'
  - '"Debugging, need to understand" → TRACE'
  - '"Why does X have this value?" → WHY'

methods:
  navigation: [PUSH, POP, BACK, HISTORY, GOTO]
  deoptimization: [TRACE, WHY, BLAME]

dynamic_deoptimization: |
  From Self: aggressively inline for performance,
  but RECONSTRUCT what stack WOULD have been
  for debugging. No runtime overhead.

  → Trace reveals step [4] failed because
