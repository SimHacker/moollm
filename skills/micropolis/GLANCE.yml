micropolishub: |
  The complete vision: Micropolis engine + MOOLLM + mooco + GitHub-as-MMORPG.
  Humans and AI characters interact via GitHub (issues, PRs) and web app.

what: |
  Micropolis as constructionist educational platform.
  A nurturing environment, not a killer app.
  Open source SimCity → WebAssembly → SvelteKit → MOOLLM.
  AI tutors. School-owned repos. Game state as git-controlled files.

lineage:
  simcity_ports: "SimCity → HyperLook → SimCityNet → Micropolis/OLPC"
  method_of_loci: "DreamScape → iLoci → MediaGraph → Bar Karma"
  web_stack: "C++/TurboGears/OpenLaszlo → MicropolisCore/Emscripten/SvelteKit → GitHub-as-MMORPG"

philosophy:
  nurturing_environment: "Provide creative people fertile ground to plant seeds"
  users_and_agents_on_common_ground: "You and AI interact in same environment"

key_ideas:
  sister_script: "CLI tool for save files, simulation, export, git multiverse"
  ai_tutors: "MOOLLM characters who debate and advise"
  school_repos: "Each school forks and owns their instance"
  git_multiverse: "Branches are timelines. PRs merge histories."
