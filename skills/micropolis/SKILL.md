## MicropolisHub

**MicropolisHub** is the complete vision — not just a simulation engine, but an integrated platform:

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| **Micropolis** | The simulation engine (C++/WebAssembly) |
| **MOOLLM** | AI character orchestration — tutors debate and advise |
| **mooco** | SvelteKit multiplayer orchestrator |
| **GitHub-as-MMORPG** | GitHub features as game mechanics — the ultimate web stack |
| **Character Simulation** | MOOLLM characters with personalities, knowledge, goals |
| **Human-AI Interaction** | People interact with simulated characters via GitHub + web app |

The key insight: Humans and AI characters interact through *both* GitHub (issues, PRs, comments) *and* the web app.

---

Open source SimCity evolved into a constructionist educational platform where:
- The **filesystem is the city** — all game state lives in git-controlled files
- **Git is the multiverse** — branches are alternate timelines, PRs merge histories  
- **AI tutors are MOOLLM characters** — advisors who debate, explain, and learn alongside you
- **GitHub is the classroom** — issues are discussions, commits are decisions, forks are universes
- **Schools own their repos** — privacy, safety, customization, community fundraising

**This is NOT a "killer app." It is a NURTURING ENVIRONMENT.**

### A Note on "Nurturing Environment" vs "Killer App"

We deliberately avoid "killer app" — the Silicon Valley term for a single application
so compelling it drives platform adoption. This is intentional design philosophy with
provenance tracing to Don Hopkins' work since 1995.

| Killer App | Nurturing Environment |
|------------|----------------------|
| One thing done perfectly | Many things made possible |
| Closed, finished product | Open, extensible platform |
| Consumes users | Cultivates creators |
| Zero-sum ("kills" competitors) | Fertile ground for seeds |

This philosophy runs through: DreamScape (1995) → iLoci → MediaGraph → Micropolis → 
MOOLLM → GitHub-as-MMORPG. The continuity is intentional and foundational.

See: [WWDC 1995 DreamScape Demo](https://donhopkins.medium.com/1995-apple-world-wide-developers-conference-kaleida-labs-scriptx-demo-64271dd65570)

## The Vision

Micropolis is not just a game. It's a **microworld** — a bounded simulation that makes complex systems tangible.

> "The thing is, this is not a Killer App. It's a nurturing environment.
> We want to give creative people an environment in which to plant their
> seeds, a fertile ground, instead of a Killer App."
>
> — Don Hopkins, WWDC 1995

The goal is to transform Micropolis into a constructionist educational platform where:

1. **All game state lives in files under git control**
2. **Branches are alternate timelines**
3. **AI tutors are MOOLLM characters**
4. **Each school owns their fork**
5. **GitHub is the classroom**

### Core Thesis

```
The filesystem IS the city.
Git IS the multiverse.
Issues ARE class discussions.
PRs ARE decisions.
AI characters ARE tutors.
```

---

## The DreamScape Heritage

This vision traces directly to **DreamScape** (1995), built on Kaleida ScriptX by Don Hopkins. DreamScape was demonstrated live at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference — without crashing (and without having to do push-ups, which was the official rule).

### DreamScape Design Philosophy

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Nurturing Environment** | Not a killer app — fertile ground for creative seeds |
| **Constructive Experience** | Open ended tools, rules, resources — unexpected behaviors |
| **Dynamic Extensibility** | Author new rooms and parts, plug together at runtime |
| **Distributed Multimedia Publishing** | Web distribution of interactive objects |
| **Transparent UI** | Content more important than control panels |
| **Direct Manipulation** | Graphical, intuitive, modeless, continuous feedback |
| **Multithreaded Animation** | Everything happening at once — gestural, not click-wait |
| **Simulation Metaphor** | Physics simulation — infinite possible states |
| **Users and Agents on Common Ground** | You and AI interact in same environment |
| **Plug-In Authoring Tools** | Dynamically loaded tools as first-class objects |

### Users and Agents on Common Ground

This principle is crucial for MOOLLM integration:

> "You can interact directly with simulated agents, because you're both part of the same environment. The butterfly can pick flowers and paint with them, as easily as you can. The painting tools respond to the gestures of whoever's holding them, human, butterfly, robot, or any cyborganic combination!"

In Micropolis + MOOLLM terms: AI tutors don't just observe and comment — they can take actions in the simulation, demonstrate techniques, and collaborate with students in the same city.

### ScriptX Web Integration (1995)

DreamScape pioneered the integration of simulation with web services:

- **MacHTTP ⟺ ScriptX bridge** — Chuck Shotton's MacHTTP as procedural content generator
- **AppleEvents pre-CGI** — Live bidirectional communication
- **"scriptx:" protocol** — URLs handled by running ScriptX
- **Dynamic HTML generation** — From ScriptX objects
- **Image maps to objects** — Click on image, event goes to actual object

This is the ancestor of the micropolis CLI sister-script concept: a bridge between the simulation engine and external tools/AI.

**Companion:** `MicropolisCore/micropolis/scripts/constants.js` (tile definitions, world constants)
**Reference:** `MicropolisCore/Cursor/city-save-files.md` (save file format spec)

> "This utility provides command-line tools for working with SimCity/Micropolis save files. It can read, analyze, visualize, and manipulate .cty and .mop files, offering various representations and export formats suitable for both human and AI analysis."

### Running

From the `MicropolisCore/micropolis/` directory:

```bash
npm run micropolis -- <command> [subcommand] [options]
npm run micropolis:info -- <file>     # Shortcut for city info
```

Supports reading from stdin with `-` as the file parameter.

### Command Reference

#### city dump [file]

```

### Save File Format

The tool reads the binary format documented in `Cursor/city-save-files.md`:

| Section | Size | Contents |
|---------|------|----------|
| History | 3,120 bytes | resHist, comHist, indHist, crimeHist, pollutionHist, moneyHist, miscHist |
| Map | 24,000 bytes | 120x100 grid, 16-bit tiles (big-endian) |
| Overlay | 24,000 bytes | Optional (.mop only), same format as map |

Each 16-bit tile encodes:
- Bits 0-9: Tile ID (0-1023)
- Bit 10: ZONEBIT (zone center)
- Bit 11: ANIMBIT (animated)
- Bit 12: BULLBIT (bulldozable)
- Bit 13: BURNBIT (flammable)
- Bit 14: CONDBIT (conducts power)
- Bit 15: PWRBIT (currently powered)

### Planned Extensions

#### Git Integration (decompose/compose)

```bash
# Decompose .cty into git-friendly YAML + binary
micropolis decompose city.cty --output city/

# Recompose directory into .cty
micropolis compose city/ --output city.cty
```

#### Batch Simulation (headless)

```bash
micropolis simulate city.cty --steps 100
micropolis simulate city.cty --until "population > 50000"
micropolis simulate city.cty --steps 1000 --checkpoint-every 100
```

#### AI Integration

```bash
micropolis analyze city.cty --for-ai --output analysis.yml
echo "zone residential 10,10 15,15" | micropolis command city.cty
micropolis watch city.cty --events
```

---

## Git Multiverse

### The Concept

From `MultiPlayerIdeas.txt`:

> "What-If?" history tree. Publish your cities on the net.
> Download other peoples cities. Use a URL to point to a saved city.
> Grab a live snapshot of somebody's running city.
> Checkpoint and branch timelines.
> Save a city back to the point where it branched,
> to create an alternate history that other players can load.

### Implementation

```
main                    # Canonical timeline
├── experiment/         # What-if explorations
│   ├── more-parks
│   ├── no-nuclear
│   └── high-density
├── student/            # Individual experiments
│   ├── alice
│   ├── bob
│   └── charlie
└── scenario/           # Curated scenarios
    ├── earthquake
    ├── flood
    └── recession
```

### Workflow

1. **Fork** the class repo → your own universe
2. **Branch** for experiments → alternate timelines
3. **Commit** decisions → checkpoint history
4. **Push** to share → publish your timeline
5. **PR** to propose → suggest changes to canonical
6. **Merge** to reconcile → combine timelines
7. **Diff** to compare → see what diverged

### State as Files

```yaml
# city.yml - Human readable, diff-friendly
name: "New Springfield"
time: 1950-03-15
funds: 20000
population: 12450

settings:
  auto_bulldoze: true
  auto_budget: true
  tax_rate: 7
  sim_speed: 2

zones:
  residential: 2450
  commercial: 890
  industrial: 1230

infrastructure:
  roads: 3400  # tiles
  rails: 120
  power_lines: 890
  
power:
  plants:
    - type: coal
      location: [45, 67]
      capacity: 200
    - type: nuclear
      location: [12, 89]
      capacity: 500
```

## AI Tutors

### Character Roster

| Character | Role | Personality |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| **Mayor's Advisor** | General guidance | Pragmatic, patient |
| **Urban Planner** | Zoning, infrastructure | Idealistic, systems-oriented |
| **Economist** | Budget, taxes | Numbers-focused, cautious |
| **Environmentalist** | Pollution, green energy | Passionate, long-term |
| **Historian** | Real-world parallels | Storyteller, context-provider |
| **Debugger** | Explain failures | Analytical, non-judgmental |

### Interaction Patterns

```yaml
# Observe and offer context
advisor:
  trigger: "player zones industrial near residential"
  response: |
    Hmm, industrial zones generate pollution that spreads to 
    nearby residential areas. Your residents might complain.
    Want me to explain how pollution works?

# Debate between characters
urban_planner:
  position: "We need more parks for land value"
  
economist:
  counter: "Parks cost money and don't generate tax revenue"
  
environmentalist:
  support: "Parks reduce pollution and increase happiness"
  
# Player decides, AI explains consequences
```

### GitHub Integration

```
Issue: "Should we build a nuclear plant?"

[Mayor's Advisor] 💼
Nuclear provides massive power but carries disaster risk.
Let me outline the trade-offs...

[Economist] 📊
At 500MW capacity for $5000, nuclear is cost-effective.
ROI analysis attached.

[Environmentalist] 🌱
Nuclear is clean during operation but disasters are catastrophic.
I recommend solar farms instead.

[Student] @urban-planner what about placement?

[Urban Planner] 🏗️
Place nuclear away from population centers.
Here's a map showing optimal locations...
```
