    contribution: "Building SimCity book, reverse diagrams"
    
    book:
      title: "Building SimCity"
      description: |
        Comprehensive analysis of SimCity's history, design,
        and cultural impact. Contains the reverse diagrams.
        
    diagrams:
      pdf: "https://github.com/SimHacker/MicropolisCore/blob/main/micropolis/static/pdf/SimCityReverseDiagrams.pdf"
      images: "https://github.com/SimHacker/MicropolisCore/tree/main/micropolis/static/images/diagrams"
      pages:
        - "Page 1: Simulate — main simulation loop"
        - "Page 2: Map Data Flow"
        - "Page 3: Maps — overlay types"
        - "Page 4: Map Scan — scanning algorithms"
        - "Page 5: Make Traffic"
        - "Page 6: Animation Characters (sprites)"
        
    significance: |
      Chaim analyzed SimCity's source code and produced
      beautiful diagrams showing how the simulation works.
      These diagrams inspire the interactive Brett Victor-style
      explorations planned for MicropolisHub.

      - "Diablo III"
      - "The Simpsons"
      
    significance: |
      Communication through concise visual documentation.
      "Why create a document with more than one page
      if most people only read the first page anyway?"
      Influenced how we communicate complex game systems.

    significance: |
      Vision for making complex systems tangible through
      direct manipulation and immediate feedback.
      Chaim's diagrams + Brett's approach = 
      interactive Micropolis explorations in MicropolisHub.
