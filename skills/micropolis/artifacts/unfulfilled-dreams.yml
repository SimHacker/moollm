# Unfulfilled Dreams
# Ideas from MicropolisCore docs that MicropolisHub can finally realize
# All paths are absolute GitHub URLs

# These ideas were written in the 1990s-2000s.
# They describe EXACTLY what we're building now.
# Technology finally caught up with the vision.

# WILL WRIGHT ON DREAMS
# The philosophical foundation for this entire document

will_wright_on_dreams:
  context: |
    Will Wright gave me this advice. It explains why we keep old design
    documents around, and why dreams written in the 1990s are being
    fulfilled now in the 2020s.
    
  paraphrase_of_will_from_don_hopkins_memory: |
    "Your personality, skills, technology, society, market, and politics
    change over time. So hang on to your dreams and never give them up,
    and every few years, take them out and re-examine them, because
    some day you might be surprised that your wildest dreams have
    finally become possible."
    
  application: |
    The PLAN.txt and MultiPlayerIdeas.txt documents in MicropolisCore
    describe ideas from the 1990s-2000s that were impossible then:
    
    - AI chatbots → Needed LLMs (arrived 2022-2023)
    - Branching timelines and community collaboration→ Needed Git and GitHub (arrived 2005, mainstream 2010s)
    - Collaborative publishing → Needed GitHub (arrived 2008)
    - Natural language programming → Needed MOOLLM (now)
    
    We took out these dreams, re-examined them, and found they're
    finally possible. That's what Micropolis + MOOLLM is.

# THE SIMS: PERSONALITY POINTS
# A cherished story about what games can do

the_sims_personality_story:
  source: "alt.family-names.sims, April 11, 2000"
  author: "Gavin Clayton"
  
  story: |
    "When I first got the game I tried to make my own family, trying to
    get their personalities accurate too. When making myself, my dad and
    my sister, I attributed points to all the personality categories,
    and I found I had points left over. But when I made my mum I ran out
    of available points and was wishing for more — I wanted to give her
    more points than are available. It made me realise for the first
    time in years how much I love my mum :-)
    
    Now what other game has ever done *that*? :-)"
    
  significance: |
    This story captures what Will Wright's games do at their best:
    they create a mirror for self-reflection. The Sims' personality
    system wasn't just a game mechanic — it became a tool for
    understanding your own family and feelings.
    
    Micropolis can do this too. Not with personality points, but
    with city planning choices that reveal your values about
    community, environment, growth, and justice.

# MIYAMOTO GDC TALK
# TODO: Add Don's Hacker News commentary and tribute
#
# Shigeru Miyamoto's GDC talk about games that deeply affect
# and connect with players — AND people watching.
# 
# Key themes to include:
# - Games that bring in observers: friends, parents, grandparents
# - Wii Sports: the family gathering game
# - Stylus games (DS): new input methods, new audiences
# - The shared experience beyond just the player
# - Similar philosophy to Will Wright on dreams
#
# Find: Don's Hacker News post with summary and commentary
# Related: the personality story — games as mirrors for relationships
#
# Both Wright and Miyamoto make games that:
# - Create emotional connections beyond the screen
# - Include people who aren't even playing
# - Reveal something about relationships
# - Persist in memory as family experiences

miyamoto_gdc_talk:
  status: "TODO — awaiting content"
  source: "Don Hopkins Hacker News commentary (find link)"
  themes:
    - "Games that affect observers, not just players"
    - "Wii Sports: grandparents playing with grandchildren"
    - "Stylus games: new inputs, new audiences"
    - "The shared experience"
  connection_to_will_wright: |
    Both Wright and Miyamoto understood that games can be
    more than entertainment for the player. They can be:
    - Mirrors for self-reflection (personality story)
    - Bridges between generations (Wii Sports)
    - Shared family experiences (watching someone play)
    - Memory-making moments that persist for years
    
    This is what "what other game has done that?" really means.

# SCOTT MCCLOUD: MASKING
# Abstract characters in realistic environments

scott_mccloud_masking:
  source: "Understanding Comics, 1993"
  will_wright_endorsement: |
    "Anyone involved in interactive entertainment (games, web, etc.)
    should read this book. Scott McCloud has once again transcended
    the world of comics and tapped into much deeper issues of creativity
    entertainment and economics."
    
  concept: |
    The "masking effect": simplistic, archetypal characters juxtaposed
    with detailed, photorealistic backgrounds. The abstract character
    allows for stronger emotional connection — viewers identify more
    easily with a mask than with a detailed face.
    
  the_sims_application: |
    Ocean Quigley (Maxis lead artist) called it the "Holodeck" technique:
    
    - Environment: 2D sprites with z-buffers (more photorealistic)
    - Characters: Real-time 3D skeletal animation (more abstract)
    
    This dovetailed with late 1990s technology constraints:
    - No graphics accelerators required
    - Could run on low-end PCs
    - Content creation with Paint/Photoshop, not 3D Studio Max
    - Vastly increased both player AND creator audiences
    
  micropolis_application: |
    Micropolis inherits this: the city is detailed and specific,
    but the player's role as "mayor" is abstract enough to project onto.
    MOOLLM characters can be more or less abstract depending on
    the educational goal — from realistic historical figures to
    archetypal roles like "The Environmentalist" or "The Developer."

# GUTTERS: THE INVISIBLE MESSENGER
# The Sims encourages players to get their mind into the gutter

scott_mccloud_gutters:
  concept: |
    In comics, the "gutter" is the empty space between panels.
    The reader fills in what happens between panels through "closure."
    The author draws static pictures; the reader's imagination
    supplies the motion and time.
    
  the_sims_application: |
    The Sims uses this extensively:
    - Simlish (gibberish language) → player supplies meaning
    - Abstract needs/moods → player interprets emotions
    - Family Album snapshots → player constructs narrative between shots
    - Blogs and stories → player fills in motivations and relationships
    
    "The Sims encourages players to get their mind into the gutter."
    
  micropolis_application: |
    MOOLLM can embrace gutters:
    - Simulation shows events; player interprets causes
    - AI characters hint at stories; player fills in details
    - City changes between sessions; player imagines what happened
    
    The best educational games don't tell you everything —
    they leave productive gaps for the learner to fill.

    To the LLM running MOOLLM, the gutters are the spaces between 
    completion calls (tokens => vectors => tokens) during which
    human interpretation of tokens, imagination, framing a response,
    and writing another prompt happens. To the human interacting with
    the LLM, it's just the complementary negative space opposite what
    the LLM sees.

      "Educators and entertainers can write interesting, informative
      personality simulation scripts for chat bots, that interactively
      chat with students playing the game, answer frequently asked
      questions, perform various utilities (like a banker or loan
      shark you can borrow money from), and refer them to web links,
      wiki pages, discussion groups, etc, for more information and
      interaction with real people.
      
      Scripts can be triggered by pattern matching on chat text from
      player, or monitoring game events and conditions.
      
      Chat bots can remember things about players, and continuously
      tell long stories and share personalized knowledge over a long

    User: "Keep pollution below 50"  
    AI: [Monitors simulation, suggests actions]
    
    The INTENT is fulfilled without the COMPLEXITY.
    
    vitamoo (SimObliterator_Suite) brings Sims-style character animation

    on canvas. Natural UI for MOOLLM characters inhabiting Micropolis
    cities: agents you can SEE moving, not just text logs.

# SUMMARY# Will Wright was right: hang onto your dreams.

summary: |
  Will Wright's advice: "Hang on to your dreams and never give them up,
  and every few years, take them out and re-examine them, because some
  day you might be surprised that your wildest dreams have finally
  become possible."
  
  These documents from the 1990s-2000s describe a vision that
  was impossible to implement at the time:
  
  - AI chat bots → MOOLLM gives us this, better
  - Branching timelines → Git IS this
  - Collaborative newspapers → GitHub Issues
  - Political roleplay → GitHub permissions
  - Visual programming → Natural language via MOOLLM
  
  MicropolisHub doesn't invent new ideas.
  It FULFILLS decades-old dreams with modern technology.
  
  We took out the dreams. We re-examined them.
  They're finally possible. That's why we're here.

# WHAT OTHER GAME HAS DONE THAT?# Gavin Clayton's question from 2000

postscript: |
  "Now what other game has ever done *that*?"
  
  That's the question Gavin Clayton asked in 2000 when The Sims
  made him realize how much he loved his mum. It's the question
  we should still be asking: what can games do that no other
  medium can?
  
  Micropolis + MOOLLM can do things that weren't possible in 2000:
  - AI characters that understand your city and teach through dialogue
  - Collaborative timelines that let classrooms explore alternatives
  - Natural language programming that makes everyone a city planner
  - Stories that emerge from simulation, not scripts
  
  The dreams were always there. The technology finally caught up.
  Now: what will we do with it?
