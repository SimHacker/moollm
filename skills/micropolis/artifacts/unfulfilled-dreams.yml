# Unfulfilled Dreams
# Ideas from MicropolisCore docs that MicropolisHub can finally realize
# All paths are absolute GitHub URLs

# These ideas were written in the 1990s-2000s.
# They describe EXACTLY what we're building now.
# Technology finally caught up with the vision.

    quote: |
      "Educators and entertainers can write interesting, informative
      personality simulation scripts for chat bots, that interactively
      chat with students playing the game, answer frequently asked
      questions, perform various utilities (like a banker or loan
      shark you can borrow money from), and refer them to web links,
      wiki pages, discussion groups, etc, for more information and
      interaction with real people.
      
      Scripts can be triggered by pattern matching on chat text from
      player, or monitoring game events and conditions.
      
      Chat bots can remember things about players, and continuously
      tell long stories and share personalized knowledge over a long
      period of time."

    ideas:
      logo_turtles:
        quote: |
          "Implement programmable logo turtles as agents that can
          move around on the map, sense it, and edit it."
        now: "AI agents with map access via CLI tool"
        
      robot_odyssey:
        quote: |
          "Like Robot Odyssey agents, so you can go 'inside' an agent,
          and travel around with it, operate its controls, read its
          sensors, and automate its behavior by wiring up visual
          programs with logic and math and nested 'ic chip' components."
        now: "Describe behavior in natural language"
        advantage: "No visual wiring needed"
        
      programming_by_demonstration:
        quote: |
          "Record a bunch of editing commands that you act out,
          then play those tapes back with relative coordinates."

      development_bot:
        quote: |
          "Program an urban sprawl development-bot to lay out entire
          residential subdivisions, complete with zones, roads, parks
          and wires."
        now: "AI character with city planning goals"
        
      luddite_roomba:
        quote: |
          "Program a luddite roomba-bot that sucks them all up and
          plants trees in their place."
        now: "Environmentalist AI character"
        
  moollm_approach: |
    Instead of visual programming (complex UI, learning curve),
    use natural language to describe agent behavior:
    
    User: "Build a residential neighborhood near the park"
    AI: [Uses CLI tool to place zones]
    
    User: "Keep pollution below 50"  
    AI: [Monitors simulation, suggests actions]
    
    The INTENT is fulfilled without the COMPLEXITY.

      "Recast editing tools/cursors as sprites/robots.
      Navigate tools around the map like a turtle/car/helicopter.
      The bulldozer tool becomes an actual bulldozer that you can
      drive around the map, crushing things in your wake.
      The road tool becomes a road building vehicle."
      
  why_unfulfilled:
    - "Requires gamepad/keyboard navigation UI"
    - "Current web version uses mouse/touch"
    - "Not essential for educational goals"

    gamepad_api: "Gamepad API available in browsers"
    ai_agents: "AI characters can operate tools programmatically"
    
  moollm_alternative: |
    Instead of you driving the bulldozer,
    tell the AI "clear this area" and watch.

# === SUMMARY ===
# The vision was right. The technology caught up.

summary: |
  These documents from the 1990s-2000s describe a vision that
  was impossible to implement at the time:
  
  - AI chat bots → MOOLLM gives us this, better
  - Branching timelines → Git IS this
  - Collaborative newspapers → GitHub Issues
  - Political roleplay → GitHub permissions
  - Visual programming → Natural language via MOOLLM
  
  MicropolisHub doesn't invent new ideas.
  It FULFILLS decades-old dreams with modern technology.
