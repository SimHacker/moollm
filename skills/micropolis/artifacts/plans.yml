# === DELIVERED: 1990s Dreams Now Reality ===
# Many ambitious plans from the original vision have been BUILT AND SHIPPED.
#
# SCORECARD:
#   Platforms shipped: 6 (X11, GTK, OpenLaszlo, WASM, SvelteKit, Sugar)
#   1993 MultiPlayer features delivered: 6 of 7 (only voting UI remains)
#   OLPC Sugar goals: Most delivered, some evolved into GitHub/MOOLLM
#   Technical architecture: Fully delivered and modernized
#   Chat bot vision: EXCEEDED (LLMs beat pattern matching)

delivered:

# === Summary: Dreams Delivered vs Still TODO ===

dreams_delivered:
  chat_bots: "MOOLLM IS this — we built the 1993 vision, enhanced with LLMs"
  branching_timelines: "Git IS this — we just needed to frame it properly"
  newspaper_publishing: "GitHub Issues + Screenshots = newspaper metaphor realized"
  political_roleplay: "GitHub teams + MOOLLM characters"
  webassembly: "C++ engine runs in any browser — no plugins, no installs"
  svelte5_ui: "Modern reactive web UI with fine-grained updates"
  multiplayer: "GitHub collaboration = multiplayer without custom servers"
  journaling: "Git history = perfect activity journal with branching"
  
still_todo:
  visual_programming: "Natural language via MOOLLM replaces visual wiring"
  agent_tools: "AI characters will operate tools, not just users"
  logo_turtles: "Programmable map agents with natural language"
  robot_odyssey: "Describe agent behavior in chat, AI implements"
  voting_interface: "Bouncing buildings while votes pending"
  gamepad_control: "Book mode / gamepad interface"
  
note: |
  Most of the 1990s vision has been DELIVERED.
  What remains is integration work: connecting MOOLLM agents
  to the running simulation, which the architecture supports.
