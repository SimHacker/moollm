# CORE PHILOSOPHY# Why Micropolis is constructionist

philosophy:
  source: "https://github.com/SimHacker/MicropolisCore/blob/main/notes/OLPC-notes.txt"
  
  core_idea: |
    "Children learn by doing and experiencing.
    Playful learning (as opposed to edutainment).
    People learn effectively through making things."
    
  why_micropolis: |
    "Micropolis is often mentioned as a great example of a
    constructionist game, in the academic literature and popular press."

# MOOLLM INTEGRATION# How AI tutors fulfill the original vision

moollm_integration:
  original_vision:
    source: "https://github.com/SimHacker/MicropolisCore/blob/main/notes/PLAN.txt"
    quote: |
      "Educators and entertainers can write interesting, informative
      personality simulation scripts for chat bots, that interactively
      chat with students playing the game, answer frequently asked
      questions, perform various utilities (like a banker or loan
      shark you can borrow money from), and refer them to web links,
      wiki pages, discussion groups, etc, for more information and
      interaction with real people. Scripts can be triggered by
      pattern matching on chat text from player, or monitoring game
      events and conditions. Chat bots can remember things about
      players, and continuously tell long stories and share
      personalized knowledge over a long period of time."
      
  now_possible: |
    MOOLLM characters ARE these chat bots, but far better:
    - Full personalities, not just pattern matching
    - Characters debate each other (adversarial committee)
    - Remember context across sessions
    - React to game events intelligently
    - Integrated with GitHub for persistent discussions
    - Natural language, not scripted responses
    
  tutor_characters:
    mayor_advisor:
      role: "General guidance"
      personality: "Supportive but challenging"
      debates_with: "Economist"
      
    urban_planner:
      role: "Land use and zoning"
      personality: "Long-term thinker"
      debates_with: "Developer"
      
    economist:
      role: "Budget and taxes"
      personality: "Numbers-focused"
      debates_with: "Mayor Advisor"
      
    environmentalist:
      role: "Pollution and parks"
      personality: "Idealistic"
      debates_with: "Industrial Developer"
      
    historian:
      role: "Context and examples"
      personality: "Story-teller"
      provides: "Real-world parallels"
      
  debate_mechanism: |
    When students face decisions, AI tutors debate:
    "Should we build the stadium?"
    - Economist: "Revenue generation..."
    - Environmentalist: "Traffic and pollution..."
    - Urban Planner: "Location matters..."
    Students learn by watching experts disagree.
