  # 1993: SimCityNet Multiplayer  # Demonstrated at INTERCHI '93, Amsterdam
  multiplayer_simcitynet:
    year: 1993
    creator: "Don Hopkins"
    platform: "X11/Unix"
    url: "https://github.com/SimHacker/MicropolisCore/blob/main/micropolis/website/pages/about/don-hopkins/multiplayer-simcity-net.md"

    voting_mechanics: |
      When placing expensive zone:
      1. Building bounces above shadow
      2. Vote dialog appears
      3. All players must vote YES
      4. Shortcut: place same zone in same place = vote yes
      5. Building lowers and plugs in
    significance: |
      First multiplayer SimCity! The voting and branching
      ideas in MultiPlayerIdeas.txt came from this version.
