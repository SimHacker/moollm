# GLANCE.yml — summarize
# Full file: CARD.yml (339 lines) | SKILL.md
# 📋 "Keep the essence. Drop the noise."

what: |
  Context compression without losing truth.
  Create metadata sidecars. Sip before gulping.
  LLM reads metadata first, full file only if needed.

why: |
  - Limited context windows
  - Token-efficient browsing
  - Multiple summary focuses
  - Bookmarks for navigation

when:
  - '"Context too large" → SUMMARIZE'
  - '"Key points quickly" → EXTRACT'
  - '"File referenced often" → METADATA'
  - '"Browsing files" → SIP'

methods:
  SUMMARIZE: "Compress content"
  EXTRACT: "Pull key points"
  METADATA: "Create foo-metadata.yml sidecar"
  SIP: "Read metadata, decide if full file needed"
  BOOKMARK: "Add named pointer into file"

metadata_pattern: |
  For foo.yml → foo-metadata.yml:
    summary: brief/standard/detailed
    keywords: [tags for matching]
    bookmarks: [name, line, note]
    visuals: {icon: prompt, card: prompt}

multi_focus_summaries:
  brief: "One line"
  standard: "Paragraph"
  detailed: "Full context"
  combat: "Game stats"
  narrative: "Story hooks"
  spoiler_free: "Safe to share"

bookmark_types:
  point: "line: 42"
  region: "lines: '15-45'"
  pattern: "pattern: '^weakness:'"
  anchor: "anchor: '&combat-stats'"

principles:
  preserve_truth: "Never invent"
  highlight_key: "Main points first"
  cite_source: "Link to original"
  compression: "10:1 ratio"
  sip_before_gulp: "Metadata first"
