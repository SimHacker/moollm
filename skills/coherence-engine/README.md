# 🔄 Coherence Engine

> *"The LLM doesn't just generate text — it maintains consistency across a distributed world."*

**Full Spec:** [SKILL.md](SKILL.md)

## Overview

The role the LLM plays in MOOLLM: a **coherence engine** that simulates entities, maintains consistency, and orchestrates the world.

## The Loop

```
READ → REASON → SIMULATE → DETECT → PROPOSE → WRITE → LOG
```

## Key Capabilities

| Capability | What |
|------------|------|
| **Simulation** | Characters, rooms, objects — all at once |
| **Roleplay** | Each entity speaks authentically |
| **Telepathy** | Speed-of-light interaction in one call |
| **Cross-check** | Validate state across files |
| **Transcription** | Write changes to files |

## Speed of Light

```
Alice: "What do you think?"
Bob: "I agree."
Carol: "I have a concern..."
[All in ONE LLM call]
```

## Consistency Checks

- Location matches room occupants
- Inventory integrity
- Reference validity
- Schema compliance
