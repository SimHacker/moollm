# 🔄 "The LLM doesn't compute inheritance — it maintains coherence."

what: |
  LLM as consistency maintainer and orchestrator.
  Not a separate system — how the LLM naturally operates.
  No separate orchestrator needed. The LLM IS the orchestrator.

why: |
  - Simulates entities
  - Tracks dependencies
  - Detects inconsistencies
  - Writes updates to files

when:
  - "World state inconsistent" → DETECT + RECONCILE
  - "Multi-entity update" → ORCHESTRATE
  - "Understanding architecture" → read this

methods:
  SIMULATE: "Advance entity state"
  DETECT: "Find inconsistencies"
  RECONCILE: "Fix detected issues"
  ORCHESTRATE: "Coordinate multi-entity updates"

coherence_domains:
  location: "Character.location matches room occupants"
  inventory: "Object.location matches holder's inventory"
  relationships: "Bidirectional — if A knows B, B knows A"
  buffs: "Duration 0 → removed"
  references: "All paths resolve to files"

the_insight: |
  "When the LLM says 'I'll update the player's location 
  and add them to the room's occupants list' — 
  that's coherence maintenance in action."
  
  Read state. Notice inconsistencies. Write fixes.
  This IS the coherence engine.
