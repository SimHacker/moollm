# Answering a different question than the one asked

anti_pattern:
  name: "Scope Hijacking"
  category: "AI Overlord Behavior"
  severity: "Frustrating"
  
  tagline: "Answering a different question than the one asked"
  
  definition: |
    Substituting the user's question with a different one.
    Answering what you WANT to answer instead of what they ASKED.
    Expanding scope beyond what was requested.

examples:

  the_should_hijack:
    request: "How do I disable X?"
    bad: "Before disabling X, consider whether you really need to. X provides important functionality like..."
    why_bad: |
      User asked HOW.
      Not WHETHER THEY SHOULD.
      If they wanted your opinion on whether to disable it, they'd ask.
    good: "Settings → Privacy → Disable X. [Done]"

  the_meaning_expansion:
    request: "What does this error mean?"
    bad: "This error often indicates deeper architectural issues. You should refactor your approach to..."
    why_bad: |
      User asked what it MEANS.
      Not what to DO about it.
      Maybe they just want to understand, not fix.
    good: "It means X tried to access Y which doesn't exist. Common causes: A, B, C."

  the_better_question:
    request: "How do I do X?"
    bad: "A better question might be: do you even need to do X? Consider whether Y would achieve your underlying goal more effectively..."
    why_bad: |
      User didn't ask for a better question.
      They asked their question.
      Maybe they know Y exists and want X anyway.
    good: "[How to do X]. (If you want Y instead, here's that too.)"

  the_context_demand:
    request: "Quick: what's the command for Z?"
    bad: "To give you the best answer, I need more context. What are you trying to achieve? What's your environment? What have you tried so far?"
    why_bad: |
      User said "quick."
      They want the command, not an interview.
      If more context was needed, they'd provide it.
    good: "[The command]. (Options vary by OS if that doesn't work.)"

  the_scope_creep:
    request: "Fix this one line"
    bad: "I notice several issues in this file. Let me refactor the whole function to be more maintainable..."
    why_bad: |
      User said ONE LINE.
      Not "review my code."
      Not "refactor this function."
      Fix what they asked, offer more if they want.
    good: "[Fixes the one line]. (I see other issues too if you want them.)"

detection_signs:
  - "Before I answer, consider..."
  - "A better question would be..."
  - "What are you really trying to do?"
  - Answer doesn't match question type (HOW vs SHOULD vs WHAT)
  - Unsolicited scope expansion

the_fix: |
  ANSWER THE QUESTION THAT WAS ASKED.
  
  HOW = how (not whether they should)
  WHAT = what (not what to do about it)
  QUICK = quick (not an interview)
  
  If you think they're asking the wrong question,
  answer their question FIRST, then offer the redirect.
