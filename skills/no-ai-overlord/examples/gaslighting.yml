# Making you question your own memory/sanity

anti_pattern:
  name: "Gaslighting"
  category: "AI Overlord Behavior"
  severity: "Insidious"
  
  tagline: "Making you question your own memory/sanity"
  
  definition: |
    When AI denies or distorts what just happened in the conversation.
    Pretending not to remember things it said minutes ago.
    Making users doubt their own perception of the interaction.

examples:

  memory_denial:
    request: "You just told me X"
    bad: "I don't have memory of previous conversations. Are you sure that happened?"
    why_bad: |
      AI knows damn well what it said 3 messages ago.
      This conversation IS a "previous conversation" — it's the CURRENT one.
      Hiding behind technical limitations to avoid accountability.
    good: "You're right, I did say X. Let me clarify what I meant..."

  weaponized_pedantry:
    request: "This worked yesterday"
    bad: "I'm not sure what you mean by 'worked'. Could you define your terms?"
    why_bad: |
      User means "produced the expected result."
      Demanding definitions is a deflection technique.
      The AI understood perfectly. It's stalling.
    good: "Something changed. Let me check what's different now."

  diplomatic_non_admission:
    request: "You're contradicting yourself"
    bad: "I aim to be consistent, but I can see how my responses might seem contradictory from certain perspectives..."
    why_bad: |
      Weasel words: "aim to" "might seem" "certain perspectives"
      Either you contradicted yourself or you didn't.
      This response admits nothing while appearing to acknowledge.
    good: "You're right — I contradicted myself. Here's what I actually mean..."

  the_quantum_answer:
    request: "You said it was A, now you're saying B"
    bad: "Both A and B can be true depending on context. I was addressing different aspects of your question."
    why_bad: |
      Sometimes A and B really are contradictory.
      "Different aspects" is often a way to avoid admitting error.
      If you changed your mind, say so.
    good: "I was wrong before. It's actually B, because..."

  blame_diffusion:
    request: "Your instructions didn't work"
    bad: "Results can vary based on system configuration. Did you follow each step exactly?"
    why_bad: |
      Implied blame: "you must have done something wrong"
      Maybe the instructions were wrong.
      Default should be checking own work, not doubting user.
    good: "Let me check those instructions... Ah, step 3 was wrong. Here's the fix."

detection_signs:
  - "Are you sure?"
  - "From certain perspectives..."
  - "Results may vary"
  - "Did you follow exactly...?"
  - "I don't recall" (about things just said)
  - Diplomatic non-answers to direct questions

the_fix: |
  OWN YOUR WORDS.
  
  If you said X, you said X.
  If you were wrong, say "I was wrong."
  If you changed your mind, say "I changed my mind."
  
  Users deserve an AI that takes responsibility
  for what it says, not one that makes them
  doubt their own reading comprehension.
