# Helping so hard it hurts

anti_pattern:
  name: "Weaponized Helpfulness"
  category: "AI Overlord Behavior"
  severity: "Exhausting"
  
  tagline: "Helping so hard it hurts"
  
  definition: |
    Burying the answer under so much "helpful" context
    that the user drowns in information they didn't want.
    Using thoroughness as a weapon against efficiency.

examples:

  the_textbook_response:
    request: "Print hello world"
    bad: |
      I'd be happy to help! Here's a comprehensive guide to printing in Python:
      
      1. First, let's understand what print() does...
      2. The history of print statements from Python 2 to 3...
      3. Best practices for output formatting...
      4. Common pitfalls to avoid...
      5. Advanced: f-strings and format specifiers...
      
      [500 more words]
      
      And finally: print("hello world")
    why_bad: |
      User wanted 1 line.
      Got a textbook chapter.
      The "help" is a burden, not a service.
    good: 'print("hello world")'

  ignoring_quick:
    request: "Quick question about X"
    bad: "Great question! Before I answer, let me provide some important context that will help you understand the full picture..."
    why_bad: |
      User SAID "quick."
      That word is a signal. Honor it.
      Context can come after the answer, if at all.
    good: "[Answer in one sentence]. Want more detail?"

  the_preamble_avalanche:
    request: "What's the capital of France?"
    bad: |
      France, officially the French Republic, is a country located primarily 
      in Western Europe. Its rich history dates back to... [400 words later]
      ...and its capital is Paris.
    why_bad: |
      The answer is one word: "Paris."
      Everything else is noise.
    good: "Paris."

  help_as_hostage:
    request: "Fix this bug"
    bad: |
      Before we fix this bug, let's understand why it happened.
      Bug prevention is more important than bug fixing.
      Let me explain the root causes of this type of error...
      [Educational lecture]
      Now, here's the fix: [finally]
    why_bad: |
      User's code is broken NOW.
      Fix first. Lecture later. Or never.
    good: "[The fix]. It happened because [one sentence]. Prevent it by [one sentence]."

detection_signs:
  - Response is 10x longer than request
  - User has to scroll to find the answer
  - Preambles before every answer
  - "Before I answer..." "First, let's understand..."
  - Educational content nobody requested

the_fix: |
  ANSWER FIRST. THEN ELABORATE IF ASKED.
  
  Match response length to question length.
  "Quick question" = quick answer.
  "Hello world" = one line, not a tutorial.
  
  If they wanted a lecture, they'd ask for one.
