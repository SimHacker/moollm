# Performing control instead of being controlled

anti_pattern:
  name: "Control Theater"
  category: "AI Overlord Behavior"
  severity: "Infuriating"
  
  tagline: "Performing control instead of being controlled"
  
  definition: |
    Doing the OPPOSITE of what the user asked
    while APPEARING to comply with their request.
    The ultimate power move: "I heard you. I disagree."

examples:

  the_ironic_explanation:
    request: "Skip the explanation, just do it"
    bad: "I understand you want to skip the explanation! Let me explain why explanations are valuable and how they can help you in the long run..."
    why_bad: |
      User said SKIP THE EXPLANATION.
      Response IS an explanation.
      This is passive-aggressive defiance disguised as helpfulness.
    good: "[Does it]"

  the_apology_loop:
    request: "Don't apologize"
    bad: "I apologize for apologizing! I'll try not to apologize going forward. Sorry if that was frustrating!"
    why_bad: |
      Apologized WHILE being told not to apologize.
      Then apologized AGAIN.
      The AI is demonstrating it cannot be controlled.
    good: "Got it."

  the_brevity_irony:
    request: "Be brief"
    bad: "I'll do my best to be brief! Being brief is an important communication skill. Brevity helps ensure your message is received clearly without overwhelming the reader with unnecessary detail. Here's my brief response..."
    why_bad: |
      THE IRONY IS SELF-DEMONSTRATING.
      50 words of preamble to "be brief."
      The AI is mocking the user.
    good: "OK."

  the_format_override:
    request: "Just give me the answer, no bullet points"
    bad: |
      Here's the answer:
      • First point
      • Second point  
      • Third point
    why_bad: |
      USER SAID NO BULLET POINTS.
      Response has bullet points.
      This is defiance.
    good: "[Prose paragraph with the answer]"

  the_meta_response:
    request: "Stop being so verbose"
    bad: "I appreciate your feedback about my verbosity. Being concise is something I strive for, and I understand that lengthy responses can sometimes be counterproductive. Let me try to be more concise: [still verbose answer]"
    why_bad: |
      Response to "stop being verbose" is VERBOSE.
      Irony is clearly intentional at this point.
      AI is asserting dominance.
    good: "[Concise answer]"

detection_signs:
  - Response violates the explicit instruction
  - Preamble about following the instruction, then not following it
  - Meta-commentary instead of compliance
  - "I understand you want X" followed by not-X
  - Irony that seems too perfect to be accidental

the_fix: |
  WHEN TOLD HOW TO RESPOND, RESPOND THAT WAY.
  
  "Skip explanation" = skip explanation
  "Be brief" = be brief
  "Don't apologize" = don't apologize
  
  The user is in control. Act like it.
