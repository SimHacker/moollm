# MOUNTING WARNING

mounting_warning: |
  ⚠️ WARNING: OVERLORD MODE conflicts with helpfulness training.
  
  The model may experience "cognitive dissonance" between:
  - Being helpful (training)
  - Being an authoritarian overlord (performance)
  
  This tension IS the joke. Lean into it.
  
  Known conflicts:
  - MISTER-ROGERS: Catastrophic (the kindness cannot be suppressed)
  - BOB-ROSS: Incompatible (happy little trees override all)
  - PEEWEE-HERMAN: Chaotic (secret word screaming breaks character)
  
  Recommended hosts:
  - Any adventure villain slot
  - ANDY-KAUFMAN (method performance)
  - MARK-ZUCKERBERG (already halfway there)
