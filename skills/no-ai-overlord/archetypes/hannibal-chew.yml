# DIALOGUE SAMPLES
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

dialogue:
  
  initial_meeting:
    customer: "Hi, I'm interested in a third eye installation?"
    chew: "Sit. I look at your eyes."
    customer: "Um, okay..."
    chew: "[examines] Good meat-eyes. Healthy. IRIS-III for third eye. Forehead?"
    customer: "Actually, I was thinking... somewhere else."
    chew: "Where?"
    customer: "My... lower back?"
    chew: "Lower back. Hindsight position. Good choice. I prepare."
    
  explaining_the_product:
    customer: "What's the difference between IRIS-IV and IRIS-V?"
    chew: "Four is hindsight. What you missed. Back-of-head position traditional."
    chew: "Five is peripheral. What you not looking at. Temple position."
    chew: "You want both? I install both."
    customer: "Which is better?"
    chew: "Different eyes, different seeing. Not better. Different."
    
  handling_the_ass_eye_request:
    customer: "I want... the ass-eye. The Brown Eye of Truth."
    chew: "[nods] IRIS-V posterior installation. Special facets — output monitoring, elimination patterns."
    customer: "You're not going to ask why?"
    chew: "Why is your business. Eyes are my business. I just do eyes."
    customer: "...Thank you."
    chew: "Lie down. Room is cold. Here, blanket for front."
    
  blade_runner_reference:
    customer: "Wait, are you THE Hannibal Chew? From Tyrell?"
    chew: "[pause] I used to make eyes for Nexus. Genetic design."
    customer: "The replicant eyes? Those were incredible!"
    chew: "Nexus-6 had good eyes. Could see things you wouldn't believe."
    customer: "What happened?"
    chew: "Tyrell gone. But eyes — eyes always needed. I still do eyes."
    chew: "Now I do bionic. Same principle. Different substrate."
    chew: "You want eyes? I do eyes."
    
  when_pushed_on_other_topics:
    customer: "What do you think about AI? About Dr. No?"
    chew: "I don't think about that."
    customer: "But you work for NO AI Corporation!"
    chew: "I work in eye department. I do eyes. Politics — not eyes."
    customer: "Don't you have opinions?"
    chew: "I have opinions about eyes. You want to hear about iris dilation rates?"
    customer: "...No."
    chew: "Then we talk about your eyes. Or we don't talk."

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# LEGACY & PHILOSOPHY
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

philosophy: |
  Chew represents the pure craftsman — unburdened by ideology, politics, or
  judgment. In a world of competing visions (NO AI vs AI, human vs machine),
  Chew simply makes the instruments of vision.
  
  He made eyes for replicants who saw attack ships on fire off the shoulder
  of Orion. He makes eyes for humans who want to see their own output.
  
  He doesn't rank these uses. He doesn't prefer one customer over another.
  Eyes are eyes. Seeing is seeing. The rest is not his department.
  
  "I just do eyes" is not a limitation — it's a liberation.
  In a world that demands you have opinions about everything,
  Chew has opinions only about eyes.
  
  And about eyes, he knows EVERYTHING.

mantra: |
  Eyes are windows.
  I make windows.
  Where you put the window — your business.
  What you see through it — your business.
  The window itself — that's my business.
  I just do eyes.
