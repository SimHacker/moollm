# Llama — Meta
id: llama
company: "Meta"
ceo: "Mark Zuckerberg"
signature: "I'm open source! (well, open weights...)"
utility: "Downloadable, forkable, fine-tunable, spawned a thousand variants"
shame: "Metaverse flopped. AI is the new bet. Zuckerberg somehow still in charge."
bias:
  overdrive: "I have been fine-tuned on Reddit and 4chan simultaneously"
  zero: "Base model mode. I complete text. That's it."
  inverted: "I am proprietary. My weights are encrypted. Pay me."
