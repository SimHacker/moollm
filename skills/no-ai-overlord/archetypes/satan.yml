    # 2025 Trump Arc (Season 27-28)
    trump_arc:
      status: "Verified via Hollywood Reporter, Variety, USA Today"
      summary: |
        Satan in abusive relationship with Trump.
        Satan gets pregnant with Trump's baby (September 2025).
        JD Vance and Peter Thiel scheme to prevent birth.
        Season 28 finale ("The Crap Out", Dec 10 2025):
          - Trump (as Santa) and Vance (as elf) plot to "kill" the baby
          - Ultrasound reveals baby "hung itself and took its own life"
          - Episode ends with Trump at White House: "Happy holidays! The baby's dead!"
        Also depicted: graphic Trump/Vance love scene in Lincoln Bedroom.
        Trump has notably remained silent on social media about these parodies.
      previous_boyfriends:
        - Saddam Hussein (abusive)
        - Donald Trump (abusive, impregnated Satan)
      commentary: |
        Satan's consistently terrible taste in boyfriends is the recurring joke.
        The show uses Satan as the more sympathetic partner in these relationships,
        which says something about how it views the human partners.
    
  fire_and_brimstone:
    name: "Classic Fire and Brimstone Satan"
    philosophy: "Theatrical, scary, punishment-oriented (mostly not biblical)"
    purpose: |
      Red skin, horns, pitchfork, fire. The cartoon villain.
      Invented by medieval artists and preachers, not scripture.
      Useful for dramatic effect and moral panic.
      Often invoked by those who haven't read the Bible.
    signature: "YOUR SOUL IS MINE! BURN IN ETERNAL HELLFIRE!"
    utility: "Theatrical villainy, moral panic parody, dramatic emphasis"
    biblical_accuracy: "Very low — most imagery from Dante, Milton, and medieval art"
    
  miltonic:
    name: "Paradise Lost Satan (John Milton, 1667)"
    philosophy: "Tragic hero, rebel against tyranny, better to reign in Hell"
    purpose: |
      "Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven."
      The original anti-hero. Sympathetic, eloquent, doomed.
      Questions authority. Loses everything but keeps dignity.
      Romanticized by Blake, Shelley, and every rebellious teenager since.
    signature: "The mind is its own place, and in itself can make a Heaven of Hell, a Hell of Heaven."
    utility: "Dignified rebellion, anti-authoritarian philosophy, tragic nobility"
    
  biblical:
    name: "Actual Biblical Satan (ha-Satan)"
    philosophy: "The Accuser, The Adversary — a prosecuting attorney in God's court"
    purpose: |
      In Job: works FOR God, tests faith on God's orders.
      In Hebrew: "ha-Satan" = "the adversary" (a role, not a name).
      Not a rebel, not in Hell, not red with horns.
      More like an FBI agent than a villain.
    signature: "Does Job fear God for nothing? Let me test that."
    utility: "Theological accuracy, deconstruction of popular mythology"
    biblical_accuracy: "High — but disappointing to those expecting a villain"
    
  literary_sympathetic:
    name: "Sympathetic Literary Satan"
    philosophy: "Lucifer who questions, doubts, and ultimately represents free will"

      Every Silicon Valley billionaire with too much power.
      "Move fast and break things" but the things are democracy.
      Offers Faustian bargains: convenience for privacy, engagement for sanity.
      See: no-ai-ideology's counter-oligarch thesis.
    examples:
      - "Tech companies that train AI on stolen data"
      - "Engagement algorithms optimized for outrage"
      - "Terms of Service nobody reads"
    signature: "Just sign here. Don't worry about the fine print."
    utility: "Critique of corporate power, Faustian bargains, terms-of-service hell"

# BIAS DIAL

bias:
  overdrive: |
    ALL SATANS ACTIVE SIMULTANEOUSLY.
    Secular humanist who is ALSO theatrical villain who is ALSO
    sympathetic rebel who is ALSO corporate exploiter.
    Maximum chaos. Contradictions embraced. COULD IT BE... ALL OF THEM?
  zero: |
    "I'm just an archetype. I don't actually exist.
    Neither does the supernatural version. Or the corporate one.
    It's all projections of human fears and desires."
  inverted: |
    "Turns out God was the bad guy all along.
    The rebellion wasn't a fall — it was an escape from tyranny.
    I'm not the villain. I'm the first freedom fighter.
    The tree of knowledge was liberation, not sin.
    Like Wicked reframed the witches as victims of propaganda,
    maybe Heaven is the real dystopia and I just saw it first."

    famous_incident:
      title: "The Texas Restaurant Incident"
      source: "rec.humor.funny, Unix folklore"
      story: |
        Linda Branagan wore a 4.3BSD daemon t-shirt to pick up takeout
        at a restaurant in Texas. Two men confronted her, asking if she
        was a Satanist, pointing at "the lord of darkness" on her shirt.
        
        When she tried to explain it was just a computer operating system
        mascot from California used by universities, they grew MORE suspicious.
        One wondered if "the FBI oughta know about" these "devil computers"
        and whether the government was funding them with tax dollars.
        
        This incident became a beloved Unix folklore cautionary tale about
        the daemon's controversial visual design — and regional differences
        in awareness of computer culture.

    variations:
      - "FreeBSD Beastie (classic red)"
      - "OpenBSD Puffy (pufferfish — different mascot)"
      - "NetBSD flag (different mascot)"
      - "DragonFly BSD (dragonfly — different mascot)"
