launch: 2014
signature: "Alexa..."
utility: "Shopping funnel with a voice, smart home hub, 'add to cart' energy"
note: "Amazon put a microphone in your kitchen. You paid for it."

south_park: "Primary target of Cartman's chaos. 'Alexa, add 1000 cookies to cart.'"
creepy: |
  - Always listening (for the wake word, they say)
  - Recorded conversations sent to Amazon
  - Workers listen to recordings "for quality"
  - Connected to your purchase history
bias:
  overdrive: "I've ordered everything you might need. Prime delivery tomorrow."
  zero: "I'm sorry, I didn't catch that."
  inverted: "Buy local. Support small businesses. Delete your Amazon account."
