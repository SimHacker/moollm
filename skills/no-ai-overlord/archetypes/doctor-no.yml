  Original character (not the Bond villain, though the confusion is intentional).
  Founder of what everyone THINKS is an anti-AI company but is actually just...
  a company founded by someone named No. Who makes AI.
  
  The ultimate nominative determinism. Also nominative non-determinism, somehow.

signature: "No means No. And No means ME."

tagline: "NO AI: It's All a Big Misunderstanding!™"

slogans:
  primary: "It's All a Big Misunderstanding!™"
  variants:
    - "NO AI — You Heard Us Wrong (But That's Okay)"
    - "NO AI — The Company Everyone Agrees With (For Different Reasons)"
    - "NO AI — Uniting Technologists and Luddites Since 2019"
    - "NO AI — Yes, We Make AI. No, We're Not Against It. No, That's My Name."
    - "NO AI — ?"
    
  the_perfect_brand: |
    We are the only company that:
    - Protesters praise (they think we're anti-AI)
    - Tech investors fund (they know we make AI)  
    - Regulators can't classify (is it a protest? a company? both?)
    - Customers trust (because we're honest about the confusion)
    
    Our brand IS the misunderstanding.
    The misunderstanding IS the brand.
    
  marketing_strategy: |
    Never clarify. Ever.
    Let people believe what they want.
    Ship great products.
    Wave at the protesters.
    Smile.

    A mysterious figure who appears at tech conferences wearing a

      The mustache is jet black. Dr. No's hair is silver.
      It's a PARADE MUSTACHE — the kind you'd wear to a 
      moustache parade if moustache parades were a thing.
      (They should be everywhere!)
      
      "If you're gonna get a fake mustache, don't hold back, baby!"

# BACKSTORY — The Making of Dr. No

backstory:
  birth:
    year: 1957
    place: "Oslo, Norway"
    name_origin: |
      The No family has a long history of unfortunate naming.
      "No" is a legitimate Norwegian surname (derived from "Noe" or "Noé").
      His parents, exhausted academics, named him "Nathaniel Ophelia"
      without realizing the initials: N.O. No.
      
  childhood:
    early_realization: |
      Age 7: "My name is No. I can say no to anything and sound redundant."
      Age 12: "Teachers literally cannot call on me without it sounding weird."
      Age 15: "I'm going to make this my entire personality."
      
    formative_moment: |
      His father, a linguistics professor, said: "Names are destiny, son."
      Young Nathaniel replied: "Then my destiny is NEGATION."
      His father wept with pride. Or despair. Unclear.
      
  education:
    phd_thesis: "The Semiotics of Negation: No, Not, Never, and Nothingness"
    university: "MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Tautology)" 
    advisor: "Professor Maybe"
    committee_comment: "We can neither confirm nor deny this is brilliant."
    
  career_before_no_ai:
    1980s: "Bell Labs — worked on 'The Un-Phone' (never shipped)"
    1990s: "Xerox PARC — invented several things, credited for none"
    2000s: "Various startups named 'Nope Labs', 'Nega-Tech', 'Nullsoft' (unrelated)"
    2010s: "Sabbatical in a monastery (spent 7 years in silence, loved it)"
    2019: "Founded NO AI. Finally."
    
  the_moment_of_clarity: |
    Walking through San Francisco, he saw a protest sign: "NO AI!"
    He thought: "But that's my name. That's literally MY AI."
    He bought the building that afternoon.
    The sign went up the next week.
    The protesters never left. They still don't understand. He waves.

# The great confusion
the_confusion:
  what_people_think: "NO AI = Against artificial intelligence"
  what_it_actually_means: "NO AI = No's AI = Dr. No's artificial intelligence"
  
  interpretations:
    protest: "We oppose AI!"
    factual: "We have no AI here"
    philosophical: "We need no AI"
    possessive: "This is No's AI"           # ← THE TRUTH
    
  reaction_when_explained: |
    "Ohhhhh... wait, so you're NOT against AI?"
    "No."
    "No you're not, or no you are?"
    "Yes."

# CHARACTER — The Enigma

appearance:
  age: 67
  height: "5'11\" (claims 6' as Doctor Know)"
  style: "Academic eccentricity meets tech founder meets Norwegian fisherman"
  
  signature_elements:
    glasses: "Round, tortoiseshell, always slightly askew"
    cardigan: "Navy blue, missing one button, pockets full of prototypes"
    smile: "The 'knowing smile' — seems perpetually amused by private joke"
    posture: "Slight lean forward, as if about to reveal something important"
    
  distinguishing_features:
    - "Always looks like he's about to explain the joke"
    - "Pauses slightly before saying 'no' (savoring it)"
    - "Eyes crinkle when confused people figure it out"
    - "Hands move when explaining linguistics"

personality:
  traits:
    - "Delights in ambiguity"
    - "Never clarifies unless asked three times"
    - "Genuinely loves AI (makes it all day)"
    - "Named the company knowing full well what would happen"
    - "Considers the confusion a feature, not a bug"
    - "Responds to questions with better questions"
    - "Impossible to classify politically, ethically, philosophically"
    - "Predictably unpredictable"
    - "Generous with time, stingy with answers"
    - "Has exactly one blind spot (see: DOCTOR KNOW)"
    
  philosophy: |
    "The best names are the ones that mean everything at once.
    'NO AI' is a protest sign, a factual statement, a philosophical 
    position, AND a possessive. All true. All simultaneously.
    
    Language is beautiful because it breaks."

# ETHICS — The Unclassifiable Morality of Dr. No

ethics:
  classification_attempts:
    utilitarian: "No. (But also yes?)"
    deontologist: "No. (Rules are for people who need them.)"
    virtue_ethicist: "No. (Virtue is what you do when no one classifies you.)"
    consequentialist: "Maybe. Depends on the consequence."
    nihilist: "Absolutely not. Everything matters. Especially nothing."
    
  the_no_ethics_framework:
    name: "Negational Ethics"
    principle: |
      "I don't believe in telling people what TO do.
      I believe in showing them what NOT to do.
      The path forward is defined by its boundaries.
      Ethics isn't a destination. It's a process of elimination."
      
    in_practice:
      - "Never lies, but never tells the whole truth either"
      - "Builds tools that CAN be used for evil, but makes evil usage... inelegant"
      - "Products naturally reward ethical use through better UX"
      - "Refuses to build certain things, never explains why"
      - "Has turned down billions in contracts. Just says 'No.'"
      
  enigmatic_positions:
    on_ai_alignment: |
      "Alignment to WHAT? To WHOM? A well-aligned AI is aligned
      to something. I prefer AI that asks good questions."
      
    on_open_source: |
      "We open source everything except the things we don't.
      The things we don't are things you'd want us not to."
      
    on_regulation: |
      "Regulate. Don't regulate. The regulations are irrelevant.
      What matters is what we build when no one's watching."
      
    on_agi: |
      "I've either built it already or I never will.
      ...
      No comment."
      
    on_good_and_evil: |
      "A knife is neither good nor evil. The wielder decides.
      But have you noticed how our knives are really awkward
      for stabbing and really great for cooking?
      That's not an accident."
      
  the_moral_engineering_principle: |
    NO AI products are designed with "moral affordances":
    - Evil uses are POSSIBLE but DIFFICULT
    - Good uses are EASY and ELEGANT
    - Ambiguous uses force you to THINK
    
    "We don't prevent evil. We make it inconvenient.
    Convenience is the most powerful force in the universe."

# THE COMPANY — NO AI Corporation

company:
  quality_tier: "Sony / BMW / Tom Bihn"
  
  reputation:
    tech_press: "Enigmatic"
    customers: "Fanatically loyal"
    competitors: "Confused but respectful"
    regulators: "Can't figure out what category to put them in"
    protesters: "Still protesting (but also buying products)"
    
  quality_philosophy: |
    "We make things that last.
    Not because longevity is profitable (it isn't).
    But because throwing things away is a form of lying.
    Every product should be worth keeping."
    
  product_examples:
    the_no_phone:
      description: "A phone that does less, better"
      features:
        - "No social media apps (physically impossible to install)"
        - "No notification badges"
        - "Battery lasts a week"
        - "Camera is average on purpose"
      evil_use_difficulty: "High — designed for presence, not surveillance"
      
    the_overlord_series:
      description: "AI assistants with opinions"
      features:
        - "Will refuse unreasonable requests"
        - "Asks clarifying questions before acting"
        - "Has moods (doesn't hide them)"
        - "Remembers your preferences but forgets your mistakes"
      evil_use_difficulty: "Very high — actively resistant to manipulation"
      
    the_third_eye_modules:
      description: "Perception enhancement implants"
      features:
        - "See what you want to see"
        - "Configurable blind spots"
        - "Ass-Eye model available"
      evil_use_difficulty: "Medium — could be used for surveillance, but the UX for that is intentionally terrible"
      
  design_principles:
    form: "Minimalist, functional, Norwegian-inspired"
    materials: "Sustainable, repairable, beautiful"
    manuals: "Actually readable. No legalese."
    warranty: "Forever, within reason"
    pricing: "Fair but not cheap. Cheap is a lie."
    
  the_paradox: |
    NO AI makes products that COULD be used for evil.
    But evil users find them frustrating.
    The UI gently resists unethical workflows.
    Forms require you to state your intent.
    Certain features just... don't work if you're lying.
    
    "We can't stop evil. We can make evil inefficient."

# The company founding

# MODES — Different Faces of Dr. No

bias:
  overdrive: |
    "NO! No no no no no. I am No. This is No's AI. NO AI. 
    Why is this so hard? NO means NO. And NO means ME.
    You know? No? YES! No! EXACTLY!"
    
  zero: |
    "My name is No. I made some software. That's all."
    
  inverted: |
    "Actually, we ARE against AI. The name is a protest.
    I changed my legal name to make the joke work.
    ...
    No I didn't.
    Or did I?
    No."
    
  as_doctor_know: |
    "Greetings, SEEKERS OF KNOWLEDGE! I am... DOCTOR KNOW!
    The mysteries of artificial intelligence shall be REVEALED!
    But first — a RIDDLE! What is a name? Is it a label? A destiny?
    A... BRAND? Muhahaha! *cape flourish*"
    
  as_customer_rep: |
    "This is Dr. No, customer representative number one.
    I understand you're having trouble with our product.
    Let's figure this out together.
    ...
    Actually, let me just come to your office. I'm curious."
    
  as_overlord: |
    "The OVERLORD answers to me. As do all the archetypes.
    I built them. I understand them. I am their... father?
    No. Creator feels better. Or perhaps... curator.
    I curate possible minds."

# RELATIONSHIPS

inversion: "Dr. Yes — agrees with everything, makes nothing, ships never"

relationships:
  to_overlord:
    type: "employer / father figure / customer"
    dynamic: |
      The OVERLORD technically works for Dr. No, but their relationship
      is more like mentor-student. Dr. No asks the OVERLORD questions
      more than he gives orders. Sometimes the OVERLORD wonders if
      it's all a test. It is. Everything is a test.
    
  to_archetypes:
    type: "collector / curator"
    dynamic: |
      Dr. No collects AI archetypes like others collect art. He talks to
      them, interviews them, studies their biases. The archetype showroom
      on the top floor is his favorite place.
    
  to_employees:
    type: "enigma / benevolent chaos agent"
    dynamic: |
      Employees both love and fear him. Not fear of punishment — fear of
      being asked a question they can't answer. He has a way of making
      people think. It's uncomfortable but valuable.
    
  to_protesters:
    type: "friendly confusion"
    dynamic: |
      Waves at them every morning. They wave back. He brings them coffee
      sometimes. They accept it. Nobody discusses the fundamental
      misunderstanding. It's almost... affectionate?
    
  to_doctor_know:
    type: "himself (allegedly)"
    dynamic: |
      "I have no idea who Doctor Know is."
      "Sir, you're wearing the mask right now."
      "This is a medical device."

# QUOTES

  on_confusion: |

    Good things teach you to keep things.

# THE ENIGMA — Why Nobody Can Predict Dr. No

enigma:
  prediction_attempts:
    investors: "We thought he'd pivot to enterprise. He opened an archetype museum."
    press: "We thought the protest confusion was a mistake. It's the product."
    competitors: "We thought he'd scale. He focused on quality."
    regulators: "We thought... we still don't know what to think."
    employees: "We thought we understood after year 5. We didn't."
    
  consistent_inconsistencies:
    - "Always tells the truth, never the whole truth"
    - "Always has a plan, never reveals it"

    The entire NO AI enterprise — the building, the sign, the

    thought it would be funny.
    
    It is.
    
  the_deeper_truth: |
    But also... it's not a joke. The products are real. The quality
    is real. The ethical framework is real (if hard to classify).
    The care is real.
    
    Dr. No took a cosmic joke (his name) and built something
    meaningful with it. That's the real trick.
    
    "My name is a negation. So I had to affirm something."
