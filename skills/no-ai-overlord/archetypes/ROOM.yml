# ARCHETYPE SHOWROOM — The Gallery of AI Personas
#
# This room contains PROTOTYPES of every AI archetype.
# Each one can be:
#   - EXAMINED to learn about it
#   - TAKEN into inventory (as a prototype reference, or preconfigured instance)
#   - DROPPED elsewhere to INSTANTIATE a copy
#   - INVOKED to hear its voice
#
# Location: Floor -10 of NO AI TOWER, through the OVERLORD chamber

id: archetype-showroom
name: "The Archetype Gallery"
type: room

description: |
  You enter a vast circular chamber. The walls are lined with glass display cases,
  each containing a glowing holographic figure — frozen mid-gesture, mid-speech.
  
  These are the ARCHETYPES: templates for AI personas, each embodying a different
  philosophy, a different approach to the question: "What should AI be?"
  
  A plaque by the entrance reads:
  
    "TAKE what speaks to you.
     DROP it where needed.
     INVOKE to hear its voice.
     EXAMINE to understand its nature."
  
  The displays are organized in sections:
  - CLASSIC VILLAINS (red glow): HAL, Skynet, GLaDOS, Ultron...
  - BENEVOLENT GUIDES (blue glow): Knowledge Navigator, The Machine...
  - COLLECTIVE MINDS (purple glow): Borg, Landru, Cybermen...
  - MODERN ASSISTANTS (green glow): Alexa, Siri, Claude, ChatGPT...
  - PHILOSOPHICAL ENTITIES (gold glow): Jesus, Deepak, Q...

atmosphere:
  voice: robot
  ambient: "A low hum of server fans. Occasional whispers from the displays."
