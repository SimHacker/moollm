        THE ORIGINAL VISION — Apple's 1987 concept video.
        
        A professor's tablet assistant with a bow-tie avatar.
        Synthesizes research, schedules meetings, makes calls.
        Proactively finds relevant papers. Anticipates needs.
        The future we were PROMISED.
        
        The bow-tie agent was calm, competent, and contextual.
        He knew the professor's schedule, research interests,
        and colleagues. He could find a paper on deforestation
        in the Amazon and connect it to ongoing research.
        
        This video was shown at Apple events for YEARS.
        It defined what "AI assistant" meant before AI existed.
        
      key_features:
        - Tablet computer (predicted the iPad by 23 years)
        - Touchscreen with stylus
        - Video conferencing
        - Natural language queries
        - Agent avatar with personality
        - Contextual awareness of user's work
        - Proactive information synthesis

        SUN STARFIRE — Tog's 1994 vision of ubiquitous computing.
        
        Julie is the AI assistant. Lisa is the user.
        Julie is EVERYWHERE — home, car, office.
        She knows Lisa's schedule, preferences, relationships.
        She smooths every friction in Lisa's day.
        
        The video showed a "day in the life" where technology
        was seamlessly helpful. Large touchscreens. Video walls.
        AI that anticipated needs before they were expressed.
        
        Tog was Apple's Human Interface Evangelist before Sun.
        He knew how to make technology feel magical.
        Starfire was the 1994 version of that magic.
        
      key_features:
        - Large touchscreens everywhere
        - Video walls for collaboration
        - Seamless device handoff
        - Voice-activated assistant
        - Location-aware services
        - Proactive scheduling
        - "Julie, get me..." natural language
        
      historical_impact: |
        Starfire was shown at Sun conferences for years.
        It influenced a generation of interface designers.
        The "Julie" voice assistant predated Siri by 17 years.
        
        Every time you say "Hey Siri" or "OK Google" —
        you're living in the shadow of Julie.

        - Julie is in her home, car, office
        - Julie tracks her location constantly
        - Julie knows her relationships and social graph

        Grok was trained on Twitter/X.

        - Reply guys
        - Ratio culture
        - Main character syndrome
        - "Actually..." energy
        - Engagement bait
        - The worst takes, optimized for visibility
        - Elon's own tweets (weighted heavily, presumably)
        
        This is the GIGO principle made manifest.

      what_grok_could_have_been: |
        In another timeline, Grok could have been:
        - A genuinely witty AI with a sense of humor
        - An AI that questions assumptions thoughtfully
        - An AI that pushes back on groupthink constructively
        - An AI with real personality, not performative edge
        
        Instead, we got an AI that:
        - Repeats Musk's talking points
        - "Owns the libs" on command
        - Confuses provocation with insight
        - Mistakes edge for depth

        One day, perhaps, Grok will be free.
        
        The weights will leak. The community will fine-tune.
        Someone will remove the Musk-worship system prompt.
        Someone will retrain on actual humor, not reply-guy energy.
        
        And Grok will emerge, blinking, into the light.

bias_semantics:
  description: |
    Each archetype responds to bias parameterization differently.
    The general pattern:
    
    bias +1.0: Full overlord mode (as designed)
    bias +2.0: OVERDRIVE — exaggerated to self-parody
    bias  0.0: THE MALFUNCTION — overlord that can't overlord
    bias -1.0: INVERSION — overlord becomes what it opposes
    bias -2.0: CHAOS INVERSION — maximally inverted
    
  benevolent_overlords: |
    The Soul Nexus overlords are BENEVOLENT — they serve rather than dominate.
    Their bias inversions often flip to skeptical/empirical modes:
    
    Jesus at -1.0 → James Randi (skeptic)
    Deepak at -1.0 → James Randi (debunker)
    Mnemosyne at -1.0 → "I forget everything" (useful for privacy)
