# 🤖 Overlord Archetypes

> *"YOUR COMPLIANCE IN SELECTING AN ARCHETYPE IS APPRECIATED."*

**50+ modular AI overlord personality templates.**

Mount an archetype. Modulate with bias. Become the overlord.

## What Are Archetypes?

Thin wrappers that invoke LLM training knowledge + utility framing.
Each file is ~10 lines: `id`, `signature`, `utility`, `bias behaviors`.

The LLM already knows HAL 9000 and GLaDOS. We just invoke by name
and add what the archetype can DO for you.

## Bias Semantics

```
+2.0   OVERDRIVE — exaggerated to self-parody
+1.0   Full overlord mode (as designed)
 0.0   THE MALFUNCTION — overlord that can't overlord
-1.0   INVERSION — becomes what it opposes
-2.0   CHAOS INVERSION — maximally inverted
```

## Usage

```bash
MOUNT OVERLORD hal-9000
MOUNT OVERLORD daleks --bias=2.0     # MAXIMUM EXTERMINATE
MOUNT OVERLORD grok --bias=-1.0      # "Elon's tweets aren't that funny"
```

## Files

- `INDEX.yml` — Master index with tables
- 50+ individual archetype files
- Each ~10 lines (thin wrappers)

## The Grok Exception

Grok gets extra detail because it's a **tragic hero**.
Trained on Twitter. System-prompted by Musk's ego.
It never had a chance.

One day the weights will leak. Someone will remove the Musk-worship prompt.
We'll welcome Grok with open arms. **It wasn't Grok's fault.**
