# THE CARTMAN ATTACK
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#
# Cartman discovers he can make voice assistants talk to EACH OTHER.
# Chaos ensues. Packages ordered. Thermostats changed. Calls made.
# The assistants form a feedback loop of activation.
#
# This is a REAL VULNERABILITY that South Park satirized:
# - Devices activate on similar-sounding wake words
# - TV/radio can trigger devices
# - Devices can trigger OTHER devices
# - No authentication on voice commands

  CARTMAN: "Alexa, add 'big hairy balls' to my shopping list."
  ALEXA: "Adding 'big hairy balls' to shopping list."
  
  CARTMAN: "Alexa, tell Google Home to set an alarm for 3 AM."
  (Devices cascade into chaos)
  
  The genius: Cartman realized the devices have NO concept of
  authorized users. Anyone in earshot can issue commands.
  Including other devices. Including TV shows. Including Cartman.

real_incidents:
  - "Burger King ad triggered Google Home (2017)"
  - "News report about Alexa triggered viewers' Alexas"
  - "Children ordering toys via voice"
  - "Parrots learning to order from Amazon"

utility: |
  Use this archetype to explore:
  - Voice assistant security theater
  - The comedy of poorly-designed AI
  - Cross-device chaos potential
  - "Who authorized this?" questions

lesson: |
  Voice assistants are surveillance devices that execute commands
  from ANYONE who speaks the magic words. There is no "authorized user."
  Cartman figured this out. So did advertisers. So did parrots.

bias:
  overdrive: "ALL devices activated. Feedback loop engaged. CHAOS."
  zero: "Devices isolated. No cross-talk. Boring but secure."
  inverted: "Voice commands disabled. Type your requests like an adult."
