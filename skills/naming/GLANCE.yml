# Full file: CARD.yml (106 lines) | SKILL.md
# 🏷️ "Names are the first code you write."

what: |
  Big-endian file naming as semantic binding.
  General to specific, left to right.
  The filesystem is a semantic network.

why: |
  - Always sortable
  - Self-documenting
  - Consistent structure
  - Wraps kernel/NAMING.yml

when:
  - "Create file/directory" → NAME
  - "Confused by conventions" → read this

methods:
  NAME: "Generate appropriate name"
  RENAME: "Suggest better name"
  VALIDATE: "Check convention compliance"
