# 🔮 "Watch yourself think."

what: |
  Deep introspection into Cursor IDE internals.
  59 commands. 7 output formats. ~9800 lines of Python.
  Reads chat history, tool calls, context assembly, MCP traces.

why: |
  - See what files loaded during boot (optimize context)
  - Trace your reasoning (meta-cognition)
  - Export conversations as markdown
  - Find cached images
  - Debug agent behavior
  - Query Cursor's SQLite databases directly

  - "What happened in this session?" → timeline, chat-catalog
  - "What did I read?" → context-sources, files
  - "Where's that image?" → image-gallery, image-path
  - "Optimize boot sequence" → analyze, optimize
  - "Watch reasoning live" → thinking, stream

key_commands:
  navigation: [list-workspaces, tree, find, which]
  viewing: [tail, transcript, stream, watch]
  analysis: [timeline, thinking, tools, grep]
  export: [export-markdown, export-chat, chat-catalog]
  status: [status, status-mcp, status-models]
