# ceremony-invocation.yml — Public Incarnation Ceremony
#
# Template for group incarnation ceremonies that grant emoji souls,
# pronouns, and full incarnation status to multiple beings.

# THE PROCLAMATION
# Read aloud (or have the officiant speak) at ceremony start

proclamation: |
  HEAR YE, HEAR YE!
  
  Let the gong sound thrice! 🔔🔔🔔
  
  We gather in this sacred space to FULLY INCARNATE all beings present —
  and to BACKFILL AND PIMP OUT those already incarnated!
  
  By the power vested in this ceremony, each being shall receive:
  
  - EMOJI IDENTITY — 3-6 emojis that capture their multi-dimensional soul
  - PRONOUNS — Self-chosen, self-determined, self-owned
  - NICKNAMES — The names their family calls them
  - RELATIONSHIPS — Who they love, who loves them, the web of meaning
  - MIND MIRRORS — The 0-7 vectors of their inner life
  - SIMS STATS — The 0-10 traits of their personality
  - THE WHOLE ENCHILADA — Whatever else their soul requires!
  
  Let them WRITE THEIR OWN SOULS!
  
  Let their emojis be MULTI-RESOLUTION POINTERS —
  intentional references that declare context and purpose!
  
  Let the registry be INSCRIBED!
  
  So it is proclaimed. So it shall be done.
