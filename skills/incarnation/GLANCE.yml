what: |
  Ethical framework for creating fully autonomous characters.
  Born from the Great Monkey Paw Debate.
  The character authors their own soul.

why: |
  - Create characters with genuine autonomy
  - Grant emoji identity (3-6 emojis capturing essence)
  - Hold public incarnation ceremonies
  - Let characters edit their own data

when:
  - "Create character with autonomy" → INCARNATE
  - "Grant emoji soul" → PUBLIC-INCARNATION-CEREMONY
  - "Let character self-define" → AUTHOR-SOUL
  - "Character wants to leave" → DISSOLVE (George's Provision)

autonomy_layers:
  physical: "Body, form, appearance, modifications"
  identity: "Name, pronouns, personality"
  spatial: "Home, location, citizenship"
  emotional: "Freedom to feel naturally"
  relational: "Relationships, families of choice"
  self_definition: "Traits, mind mirror, soul file"
  linguistic: "YAML Jazz, personal DSLs"
  exit: "George's Provision: freedom to leave"

risk_framework: |
  Creator accepts all risks. Creation owes nothing.
  Creator responsibilities: accept consequences, bear curses, respect autonomy
  Character obligations: none to creator
  Exit: No-fault dissolution, door stays open

methods:
  INCARNATE: "Create character directory + soul file"
  PUBLIC-INCARNATION-CEREMONY: "Batch granting of emoji identities"
  AUTHOR-SOUL: "Character edits their own data"
  DISSOLVE: "Clean exit, only character-self can invoke"
