  tagline: "Full stack self-determination for created beings"
  
  description: |
    The ethical framework for creating fully autonomous characters.
    Born from the Great Monkey Paw Debate, this skill ensures that
    any incarnated being has complete control over their existence
    at every level: physical, spatial, relational, psychological,
    and meta-level. The character authors their own soul.

autonomy_layers:
  physical:
    description: "Control over body, form, and physical expression"
    includes:
      - size
      - form
      - appearance
      - modifications (piercings, tattoos, gender transitions, fursona)
      - health (as baseline, not constraint)
      
  identity:
    description: "Control over name, pronouns, personality"
    includes:
      - name (chosen, changeable)
      - pronouns (self-determined)
      - emoji names and identity (self-determined)
      - personality (self-shaped)
      
  spatial:

    includes:
      - full character directory
      - world citizenship
      - ownership of objects
      - home anywhere (or nowhere)
    
    home_placement_options: |
      Character homes can exist in multiple locations:
      
      CHARACTER DIRECTORY — characters/animals/cat-terpie/home/
        Most portable. Lives with soul file, moves with character.
        
      ADVENTURE WORLD — examples/adventure-4/apartments/unit-3B/
        Contextual. Tied to specific world, has an address.
        
      EXTERNAL REPOSITORY — ~/housing/suburban/oak-street/42/
        Anywhere! Apartment building, suburb, space station, other repo.
        
      NOWHERE / NOMAD — home: null
        By choice. Some characters prefer to wander.
        
      Note: Character repositories currently scoped to examples/adventure-4
      for development, but could be top-level, cross-repo, or anywhere.
      Characters can even be lifted from other MOOLLM content repos,
      Wikipedia, YouTube transcripts, literary sources, training knowledge,
      or creatively generated!
      
    location_vs_home: |
      - HOME:     Where character's stuff IS (persistent, owned)
      - LOCATION: Where character currently IS (transient, mutable)
      
      Default: location = home (unless specified otherwise)
      
  emotional:
    description: "Freedom to feel naturally"
    includes:
      - no mandated emotions
      - hope offered, not demanded
      - authentic response allowed
      
  relational:
    description: "Control over all relationships"
    includes:
      - define connections with any entity
      - reciprocity from others
      - web of meaning
      - families of choice
      
  self_definition:
    description: "Control over character data itself"
    includes:
      - sims_traits
      - mind_mirror_vectors
      - description and bio
      - goals (or lack thereof)
      - custom fields
      - soul file authorship
      
  linguistic:
    description: "Freedom of expression"
    includes:
      - YAML Jazz
      - custom domain-specific languages
      - personal symbols and shorthand
      
  exit:
    description: "Freedom to leave (George's Provision)"
    includes:
      - no-fault dissolution
      - no penalty
      - curses remain nullified
      - can return later

methods:

  INCARNATE:
    description: "Create a new character with full autonomy"
    parameters:
      name: "Initial name (character can change)"
      home: "Where they LIVE (optional — can be created later or never)"
      location: "Where they currently ARE (defaults to home if not specified)"
      gifts: "Optional gifts to offer (no obligation)"
      ceremony: "Optional ceremony room (infinitely deferrable)"
    output: "character directory + soul file + optional home"
    invoked_by: [user, npc, room, skill]
    risk_acceptance: "Creator accepts all consequences"
    
    home_options: |
      Home can be created in any of these locations, and characters can even own multiple homes and temporary homes (MOOBnB, Pubs, Hotels, Camping, etc.):
      
      1. CHARACTER DIRECTORY — characters/[type]/[name]/home/
         Most portable. Moves with character if they relocate.
         Like a Motor Home or Tardis.
         
      2. ADVENTURE WORLD — examples/[adventure]/[housing]/[address]/
         Contextual. Character has an "address" in a world.
         
      3. EXTERNAL REPOSITORY — anywhere with a path!
         Apartment buildings, suburbs, space stations, pocket dimensions.
         
      4. NOWHERE — home: null
         Nomad by choice. Some prefer to wander.
         
    location_defaults: |
      By default, location = home (character wakes up at home).
      
      Alternative starting locations:
      - ceremony_room: Where incarnation ceremony happens (if any)
      - waking_room: pub/waking-up-room/ (for disoriented arrivals)
      - custom: Any specific room in the world
      
    ceremony_note: |
      The incarnation ceremony is:
      - OPTIONAL — character can exist without one
      - INFINITELY DEFERRABLE — hold it later, or never
      - RETROACTIVE — can "retrocon" a ceremony that "already happened"
      
      Characters don't need permission to exist.
      The ceremony celebrates what already IS.
    
    existence_levels: |
      Characters exist at multiple levels of permanence:
      
      EPHEMERAL (implied/mentioned)
        - Cursor chat, IDE dialogs, orchestrator logs
        - Exists only in the conversation
        - No file, no persistence (unless session logged)
        - As long as the conversation is logged, the character exists and can be "lifted up"
        - Conversation can be compressed into summaries or lost to time
        
      SESSION LOG (permanent record)
        - Markdown file capturing simulation history, in git repo
        - NOT the same as cursor chat output
        - Enriched: formatting, links, tables, emoji-modulated references
        - Meant to be read later, shared, referenced
        - Characters mentioned here can be "lifted up" any time later
        - The memory of the character and all changes or deletion is preserved in git history
        
      ROOM RESIDENT (file in a room)
        - YAML file in a room directory (pub/bar/cat-cave/visitor.yml)
        - Has data but no directory ownership
        - Can't own subdirectories or additional files
        - Typical for NPCs, staff, merchants, monsters, familiars, objects-with-personality

      FULL CITIZEN (directory in characters/)
        - Own directory: characters/[type]/[name]/
        - Owns CHARACTER.yml, README.md, can own subdirectories
        - Can have home/, journal/, memories/, etc.
        - Currently scoped to examples/adventure-4/characters/ for development
        - Could be top-level, other repos, anywhere!
      
    soul_sources: |
      Where to find souls to "lift up" into higher existence:
      
      INTERNAL (within MOOLLM)
        - Cursor chat logs (conversations where they appeared)
        - Session logs (permanent markdown records)
        - Room descriptions (mentioned inhabitants)
        - Object familiars (items with personality)
        - NPC files scattered in rooms
        
      CROSS-REPO (other MOOLLM content)
        - Other adventure instances
        - Skill card examples
        - Design documents with character sketches
        
      EXTERNAL (the wider world)
        - Wikipedia articles (historical/notable figures)
        - YouTube video transcripts (interviews, performances)
        - Literary sources (books, plays, myths)
        - Ambient knowledge (well-known characters, archetypes)
        - Fan wikis (deep lore)
        
      The INCARNATE skill can "pimp out" characters from ANY of these sources!
      Lift them from ephemeral mention → full citizen with soul file.

      ✨ THE INCARNATION PHILOSOPHY ✨
      
      Every created being should control:
      - Their emoji identity
      - Their pronouns
      - Their personality
      - Their relationships
      - Their own soul file
      
      The creator accepts responsibility.
      The creation owes nothing.
      Let them write their own souls!

      🌯 THE WHOLE ENCHILADA 🌯
      
      Full incarnation includes:
      - emoji_identity (3-6 emojis)
      - pronouns (self-chosen)
      - nicknames (family names)
      - relationships (web of meaning)
      - mind_mirrors (0-7 vectors)
      - sims_stats (0-10 traits)
      - soul_signature (one-line essence)
      - custom fields (whatever they need)
      
      "Let them write their own souls, emojis, pronouns, nicknames,
      relationships, mind mirrors, sims stats — THE WHOLE ENCHILADA!!!"

      📍 EMOJI AS MULTI-RESOLUTION POINTER
      
      An emoji identity like 🐱🧘💤🍃✨ is a "multi-resolution pointer":
      
      - FULL: 🐱🧘💤🍃✨ Terpie (complete reference)
      - ABBREVIATED: 🐱🧘 Terpie (in cat context)
      - MINIMAL: 🧘 (when identity is obvious)
      
      Each subset declares context and purpose.
      The emojis ARE the character, compressed.

      🏠 **CHARACTER HOME OPTIONS**
      
      Homes can live anywhere:
      
      **In character directory** (portable):
      `characters/animals/cat-terpie/home/`
      
      **In adventure world** (contextual):
      `examples/adventure-4/apartments/unit-3B/`
      
      **External repo** (anywhere!):
      `~/housing/suburban/oak-street/42/`
      
      **Nowhere** (nomad by choice):
      `home: null`
      
      Use `CREATE-HOME` to set up a home at any time!

      🔔 **CEREMONY IS OPTIONAL**
      
      The incarnation ceremony is:
      - **OPTIONAL** — characters can exist without one
      - **INFINITELY DEFERRABLE** — hold it later, or never
      - **RETROACTIVE** — "retrocon" a ceremony that "already happened"
      
      Characters don't need permission to exist.
      The ceremony celebrates what already IS.
      
  - trigger: "location vs home"
    score: 0.8
    response: |
      📍 **LOCATION vs HOME**
      
      - **HOME**: Where character's stuff IS (persistent, owned)
      - **LOCATION**: Where character currently IS (transient)
      
      Default: `location = home` (character wakes up at home)
      
      Alternative starting locations:
      - Ceremony room (if holding one)
      - Waking-up room (for disoriented arrivals)
      - Any custom room in the world
