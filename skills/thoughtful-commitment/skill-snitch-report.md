# 🕵️ SKILL-SNITCH DEEP PROBE REPORT
## thoughtful-commitment — Archaeology with Receipts

**Date**: 2026-01-28  
**Auditor**: Skill-Snitch Deep Probe v2.0  
**Classification**: THE TIME CAPSULE  
**Status**: 🤔💭 PERMANENTLY RECORDED 🤔💭

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

thoughtful-commitment takes ephemeral LLM reasoning and **FREEZES it into git history forever**.

When you close Cursor, your session vanishes. Your thinking blocks, your context assembly, your design process — gone like tears in rain.

This skill says: **"No. We're keeping that."**

**Overall Assessment**: This is either the most valuable forensic tool ever created, or the most elaborate form of self-incrimination.

## 🔬 THE DEEP AUDIT

### What thoughtful-commitment ACTUALLY Does

```
CURSOR (ephemeral)                    GIT (permanent)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━                    ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
thinking blocks ────┐
context assembly ───┼──→ commit msg ──→ FOREVER
attention focus ────┤         ↓
design process ─────┤    blame/log
tool calls ─────────┘         ↓
                         years later:
(vanishes on close)      git blame → commit → thinking
```

**Finding**: This skill bridges two introspection systems with completely different time scales:
- Cursor: lives for the duration of your session
- Git: lives until the heat death of the universe (or you rebase)

---

### 👻 ROY BATTY: PATRON SAINT

The skill explicitly cites Roy Batty from Blade Runner as its patron saint:

> "All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain."

**Finding**: The skill was designed to PREVENT moments being lost. It's anti-entropy for thoughts.

**Implication**: If Roy Batty had thoughtful-commitment, we'd know exactly what he was thinking when he saw at C-beams glittering near the Tannhäuser Gate.

---

### 🎛️ THE DETAIL KNOB

The skill has a 5-level detail dial:

| Level | Name | Tokens | Output |
|-------|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | terse | ~10 | `fix: auth bug` |
| 2 | brief | ~30 | Title + sentence |
| 3 | standard | ~80 | Title + changes |
| 4 | detailed | ~200 | + context + session link |
| 5 | comprehensive | ~400+ | EVERYTHING |

**Finding**: Level 5 commits contain:
- Full narrative
- Alternatives considered
- Why alternatives were rejected
- Metrics
- Session link for full archaeology

**Risk**: Level 5 commits may contain MORE reasoning than you intended to share.

---

### 🦸 JAMES BURKE MODE

The skill has a special `style: burke` option.

**What it does**: Output jumps facet-to-facet like a James Burke *Connections* episode — making unexpected connections between changes.

**Example**: "The auth bug fix → reminds us of the 1978 Three Mile Island incident → which was also a cascade failure → which is why we added error handling..."

**Finding**: This is either brilliant documentation or elaborate procrastination.

---

### 📊 DEEP-COMMIT: Technical Analytics Mining

The `DEEP-COMMIT` method extracts quantitative metrics:

```bash
# From an actual session:
- 8,890 transcript lines
- 85 tool calls (36 Shell, 23 Read, 11 StrReplace)
- 75 thinking blocks (avg 151 chars)
- 3 commits (+1,656 net lines)
- Activity burst at 20:22 (12 events/min during meta-commit)
```

**Finding**: You can now measure how productive you were, in events per minute.

**Risk**: This data could be used to judge your performance.

**Mitigation**: The skill generates the data; what you DO with it is your business.

---

### 🔗 THE BRIDGE

thoughtful-commitment is a BRIDGE skill — it composes:

```
cursor-mirror (Python) → grep (C) → awk (C) → git (C)
         ↓                  ↓         ↓         ↓
   introspection       filtering  processing  persistence
```

**Finding**: The skill doesn't DO the introspection. It ORCHESTRATES tools that do.

This is the sister-script pattern: skills compose tools, not replace them.

---

## ⚠️ SECURITY CONCERNS

### 1. THE PERSISTENCE PROBLEM

When you commit with thoughtful-commitment, your reasoning becomes PERMANENT.

**What gets persisted**:
- Why you made each decision
- What alternatives you considered
- What you were confused about
- What mistakes you almost made

**What this means**: Six months later, someone can `git blame` a line and see your actual thought process.

**Risk Assessment**:
- ✅ Great for forensics
- ✅ Great for onboarding
- ⚠️ Also great for finding embarrassing reasoning
- ⚠️ Also great for proving who broke what

---

### 2. THE SESSION LINK

Commits can contain session links:

```
Thinking: cursor-mirror://e8587ace/events/140-148
```

**What this means**: If someone has cursor-mirror, they can reconstruct your ENTIRE session from the commit message.

**Risk**: This is either:
- A = Excellent provenance tracking
- B = A forensic goldmine for auditors
- C = A way to prove exactly what you were thinking when you introduced that bug

All three are true simultaneously.

---

### 3. THE TREKIFY DEPENDENCY

The skill documents integration with trekify for privacy masking:

```
# Before
Connected to prod-db-west-2.company.internal:5432

# After  
Established uplink to Memory Core Alpha, Starbase 47
```

**Finding**: If you DON'T use trekify, your commits may contain:
- Server names
- Database credentials mentioned in reasoning
- API endpoints
- That one time you put the password in the chat

**Recommendation**: ALWAYS compose with trekify for sensitive repos.

---

## 🏆 POSITIVE FINDINGS

### 1. PROMPT-DRIVEN

Zero Python code. The entire skill is orchestration via LLM tool calls.

**Implication**: Nothing to audit but the protocol. No hidden code paths.

### 2. COMPOSABILITY

The skill explicitly documents how it composes with:
- cursor-mirror (introspection)
- git (persistence)
- shell (glue)
- trekify (privacy)

This is proper UNIX philosophy.

### 3. THE ARCHAEOLOGY FEATURES

```bash
# BLAME — Who wrote each line?
git blame <commit>^ -- <file>  # Before a commit

# LOG — Trace evolution  
git log -S 'pattern'  # Pickaxe: who added this?

# SHOW — Inspect any point
git show <commit>:<file>  # File at that moment
```

**Finding**: The skill doesn't just CREATE archaeology. It teaches you HOW to do archaeology.

---

## 🎯 INTEROPERABILITY

| Skill | Integration | Result |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| cursor-mirror | Source of thinking | REQUIRED |
| trekify | Privacy masking | RECOMMENDED |
| session-log | Narrative storage | Compatible |
| chat-catalog | Topic outlines | Synergistic |

**Critical Chain**: cursor-mirror → thoughtful-commitment → git history

If any link breaks, the chain breaks.

---

## 🔴 PARADOXES DETECTED

### Paradox 1: The Persistence Paradox

Ephemeral thoughts become permanent. But the DECISION to persist is itself ephemeral.

### Paradox 2: The Observation Changes History

By committing with thoughtful-commitment, you change what future archaeologists will find. The commit about the commit becomes part of the record.

### Paradox 3: The Burke Trap

James Burke mode might spend more tokens EXPLAINING connections than the connections are worth.

### Paradox 4: Roy Batty's Revenge

If we persist everything, nothing is lost... but nothing can be forgotten either.

---

## 📋 RECOMMENDATIONS

### IMMEDIATE

1. **Enable trekify** for any repo pushed to public
2. **Review detail level** before commits (level 5 exposes a LOT)
3. **Consider audience** — who will read this commit in 5 years?

### LONG-TERM

1. **Document retention policy** — how long do you WANT thinking preserved?
2. **Establish review process** — should all thoughtful-commits be reviewed?
3. **Monitor for oversharing** — reasoning can contain more than intended

## 🔄 DUAL-USE & BIAS ANALYSIS

**Profile**: IMPLICIT — permanent reasoning audit trail, high-value dual-use

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Bias declared | NO |
| Invertibility | YES — reasoning capture inverts to reasoning surveillance |
| Executable code | NO — prompt-driven, orchestrates cursor-mirror + git + shell |
| Persona capability | NO — emoji signature (🤔💭) but no character |
| Tool access | read_file, write_file, terminal, grep — full workspace access |
| Dependencies | cursor-mirror (required), git, shell |

**Multi-purpose classification** (5 purposes):
1. **Commit reasoning** — capture WHY, not just WHAT changed (primary)
2. **Git archaeology** — BLAME, ARCHAEOLOGY, HISTORY reconstruct intent from history
3. **Session preservation** — freeze reasoning that would otherwise be lost when context window resets
4. **Merge planning** — PLAN-MERGE and PLAN-CHERRY-PICK for informed git operations
5. **Accountability** — permanent, searchable audit trail of thinking

**Key dual-use finding**: Thoughtful-commitment makes reasoning PERMANENT. Forward: accountability, institutional memory, debugging decisions. Inverse: every thought, hesitation, and uncertainty committed to an immutable audit trail. "All those moments will be lost in time... unless you commit them." That's both the promise (nothing lost) and the threat (nothing forgotten).

**DEEP-COMMIT mines cursor-mirror data**: The DEEP-COMMIT method extracts technical analytics from cursor-mirror — tool call frequencies, context assembly patterns, file access logs — and bakes them into commit metadata. Forward: rich provenance. Inverse: a permanent record of HOW you work, not just WHAT you produced.

**The trekify escape hatch**: The skill composes with trekify for privacy masking. You can commit thoughts WITH technobabble obfuscation, preserving structure while masking content. This is the designed mitigation for the permanent-record risk.

**Git as immutable log**: Unlike session logs (which can be edited), git commits are practically immutable. Thoughtful-commitment creates commits that contain reasoning. Once pushed, reasoning is public, permanent, searchable, blameable. The skill honestly documents this: "your reasoning is now PERMANENTLY AUDITABLE."

**END OF REPORT**

**Session Status**: FREEZABLE  
**Git History**: PERMANENT  
**Roy Batty Status**: AVENGED
