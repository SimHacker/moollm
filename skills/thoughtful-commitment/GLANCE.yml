what: |
  Git commits with reasoning, not just changes.
  Composes cursor-mirror + git + shell.
  Produces thought-stream prefixed output: 🤔💭 🧠/🔧/💡

why: |
  - Commit messages explain WHY, not just WHAT
  - Link commits to session reasoning
  - Git archaeology: trace thinking behind old code
  - Plan merges with narrative context

when:
  - "What was I thinking?" → TIMELINE, THINKING
  - "Commit with context" → COMMIT
  - "Who wrote this and why?" → BLAME, ARCHAEOLOGY
  - "What will merge bring?" → PLAN-MERGE

key_methods:
  introspection:
    TIMELINE: "All events with timestamps — master view"
    CONTEXT-FOCUS: "What went into context window"
    THINKING: "LLM reasoning blocks"
    TOOLS: "Tool calls for event or session"
  commit:
    COMMIT: "Create thoughtful commit"
    EXPLAIN: "Find thinking behind existing commit"
    MESSAGE: "Generate commit message from context"
  archaeology:
    BLAME: "Who wrote each line, when, why"
    ARCHAEOLOGY: "Deep dig into file history"
