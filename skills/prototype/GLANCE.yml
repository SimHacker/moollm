# 🧬 "Objects clone from prototypes, not instances from classes."

what: |
  Self programming language philosophy for MOOLLM.
  Everything is concrete. Nothing is abstract.
  Delegation, not inheritance. Networks, not trees.

why: |
  - YAML files are objects, not classes
  - Clone and change, don't subclass
  - Dynamic slot addition
  - "Like this, but different"

when:
  - '"Understanding inheritance" → EXPLAIN'
  - '"Designing prototype relationship" → DESIGN'
  - '"Debugging delegation" → TRACE'
  - '"Comparing paradigms" → COMPARE'

methods:
  EXPLAIN: "Explain prototype inheritance"
  DESIGN: "Design prototype relationship"
  TRACE: "Walk delegation chain"
  COMPARE: "Prototype vs class comparison"

core_distinction:
  class_based: "Instance of abstract class"
  prototype_based: "Clone of concrete object"

delegation: |
  excalibur.inherits: sword-prototype
  excalibur.damage: 50 (override)
  excalibur.type: → delegates to prototype → "weapon"

moollm_applications:
  character: "inherits skills/character"
  room: "inherits skills/room"
  buff: "inherits skills/buff"
  any_yaml: "inherits chain"

anti_taxonomy: |
  Not trees: 'Thing → Animal → Dog → Labrador'
  But graphs: 'biscuit ←→ labrador-traits ←→ friendly-traits ←→ palm'

wisdom:
  - "The best message is no message."
  - "Self is a network, not a node."
  - "Everything is concrete. Nothing is abstract."
