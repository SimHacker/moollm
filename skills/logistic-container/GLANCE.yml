# 📦 "Items flow like water through pipes to where they're needed."

what: |
  Factorio-style logistics containers.
  Items flow automatically between providers and requesters.
  Grid storage with auto-created cells.

why: |
  - Automated storage and flow
  - Provider/requester network
  - Fungible vs instance tracking
  - Stacking and filtering

when:
  - '"Automated storage" → CREATE-LOGISTICS'
  - '"Complex inventory" → MANAGE-INVENTORY'
  - '"Production chains" → BUILD-FACTORY'
