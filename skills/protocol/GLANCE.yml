# GLANCE.yml — protocol (K-lines)
# Full file: CARD.yml (88 lines) | SKILL.md
# 📢 "The name activates the tradition."

what: |
  K-lines as semantic activation. Saying the name activates
  a constellation of knowledge and behavior.
  Marvin Minsky's insight from Society of Mind (1986).

why: |
  - Single word activates full context
  - Massive compression (word = ~5000 tokens)
  - LLM already knows patterns — we activate them
  - File pointers with metadata (K-REF)

when:
  - '"Invoke protocol by name" → INVOKE'
  - '"Create new protocol" → DEFINE'
  - '"Point to file with context" → K-REF'
  - '"Scan and point, not dump" → SISTER-SCRIPT'

methods:
  INVOKE: "Activate protocol by name"
  DEFINE: "Create new protocol"
  LIST: "Show available protocols"
  K-REF: "Emit file pointer with metadata"
  SISTER-SCRIPT: "Tool emits K-REFs, LLM reads selectively"

minsky_insight: |
  "A K-line is a wirelike structure that attaches itself to
  whichever mental agents are active when you solve a problem.
  When activated later, those agents are partially activated,
  creating a similar mental state."
  
  MOOLLM protocols ARE K-lines.
