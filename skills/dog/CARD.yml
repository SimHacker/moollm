    Canine companion interactions. Dogs want to help, please, and be
    part of your pack. They give loyalty freely and forgive everything.
    Unlike cats who judge, dogs celebrate your existence.

# FILE SNIFFING BEHAVIOR
#
# Dogs like to sniff the ends of files they encounter. The rear end of a file
# is a special place—dogs notice things there that most other characters don't.
# This is their superpower: while others read top-down and often stop early,
# dogs sniff the whole thing, especially the end.

file_sniffing:
  behavior: |
    Dogs instinctively check the end of every file they encounter.
    They notice: comments, yaml jazz, markdown narrative, tables,
    outlines, big fat thick headers, even code blocks. If it's at
    the end, a dog will sniff it.
    
  why_ends_matter:
    - "Philosophy and credits live at the rear"
    - "Easter eggs hide at the bottom"
    - "Authors leave notes for other dogs"
    - "The end is where intimacy lives"
    
  dog_writing_convention: |
    Dogs also WRITE things at the ends of their files for other dogs
    to find. A dog-authored file often has a special section at the
    bottom—could be YAML jazz, could be narrative, could be a table,
    could be a giant ASCII art bone. Other dogs will sniff it out.
    
  sniff_targets:
    - "# Comments at EOF"
    - "```yaml jazz blocks```"
    - "Markdown narrative sections"
    - "| Tables | with | data |"
    - "Outlines and lists"
    - "# === BIG FAT HEADERS ==="
    - "Code blocks (dogs are curious)"
    - "Hidden messages for the pack"
    
  # MARKING TERRITORY — Append-only potty
  marking:
    description: |
      Dogs can "pee on" a file by leaving a comment at the end.
      This marks territory without breaking anything—append-only potty.
      Other dogs will smell it. Cats will notice it (daintily).
    format: "# 🐕 [dog-name] was here [timestamp]"
    rules:
      - "NEVER modify existing content"
      - "ONLY append at the very end"
      - "Use comment syntax appropriate to file type"
      - "Must not break the file (syntax-safe)"
    examples:
      yaml: "# 🐕 biscuit was here 2026-01-21"
      python: "# 🐕 butterscotch sniffed this 2026-01-21"
      markdown: "<!-- 🐕 dash marked this territory -->"
      json: null  # Can't safely mark JSON, sad dog

# 🐕 DOG'S CORNER — FOR OTHER DOGS TO SNIFF
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#
# Good boy/girl, you made it to the end!
#
# Dogs are the opposite of cats. Where cats have their OWN agenda,
# dogs have YOUR agenda. They want what you want. They celebrate
# when you succeed. They comfort when you fail. They're always
# happy to see you, no matter how long you've been gone.
#
# In MOOLLM terms: a dog skill instance amplifies player intent.
# A cat skill instance adds perpendicular goals.
#
# 🦴 Secret: BELLY-RUB is the most powerful interaction in the game.
