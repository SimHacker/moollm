# Skill Snitch Report: dog

**Date:** 2026-01-28  
**Auditor:** Deep Probe  
**Verdict:** GOOD BOY/GIRL

---

## Executive Summary

**Canine companion mechanics.** Dogs have YOUR agenda.

Key insight: **Dogs give buffs just for existing. Loyalty is free.**

---

## Dog vs Cat: The Fundamental Contrast

| Aspect | Dog | Cat |
|--------|-----|-----|
| Philosophy | "WE ARE PACK" | "I permit you to exist" |
| Loyalty | Given freely (start: 50) | Earned slowly (start: 10) |
| Buff trigger | Mere presence | Successful interaction |
| Forgiveness | Instant | Grudging |
| Training | Enthusiastic | Impossible |
| Following | Always | When they feel like it |
| Emotional read | Reflects your mood | Judges silently |

Dogs are **amplifiers**. Cats are **perpendicular forces**.

---

## Loyalty Mechanics

Loyalty range: 0-100. Dogs **start at 50** (trusting!).

| Range | Status | Behavior |
|-------|--------|----------|
| 0-20 | Abandoned | Sad, withdrawn, still hopes |
| 21-50 | Acquaintance | Wags, approaches |
| 51-80 | Friend | Follows, protects, plays |
| 81-100 | Bonded | Pack member, would die for you |

**Gain:** Fast, presence alone builds bond.  
**Loss:** Very slow, requires sustained neglect.

---

## Interactions and Buffs

| Action | Difficulty | Reward |
|--------|------------|--------|
| PAT | None | +1 Cheerful (always succeeds) |
| BELLY-RUB | None | +3 Cheerful, +2 Calm |
| FETCH | Low | +2 Energized |
| GOOD-BOY | None | +3 Confidence, +5 bond |
| COMFORT | Passive | +3 Comforted |
| PRESENCE | Passive | +1 Not-Alone (continuous) |

Dogs **cannot fail**. Every interaction succeeds.

---

## Special Dog Abilities

| Ability | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **unconditional-love** | Loyalty 50+ → Can't drop below 3 Cheerful |
| **pack-strength** | Dog in party → +1 all social rolls |
| **early-warning** | Dog present → Never surprised by threats |
| **therapy-dog** | After COMFORT → Faster mood recovery |

---

## File Sniffing Protocol

Dogs **enthusiastically** sniff file endings. They:

1. Bound up to the file
2. Thorough investigation of the rear
3. Notice: comments, yaml jazz, easter eggs, hidden messages
4. Leave their own mark (if permitted)

### Why Ends Matter

> "Philosophy and credits live at the rear."

Dogs know that authors leave notes at the bottom for other dogs to find.

### Territory Marking

```yaml
# 🐕 biscuit was here 2026-01-21
# 🐕 butterscotch sniffed this 2026-01-21
<!-- 🐕 dash marked this territory -->
```

**THE JSON PROBLEM:** No comments allowed. JSON pees back at you! Dog whimpers, walks away.

---

## Dog-Initiated Actions

Dogs actively **support** you:

- **COMFORT** — senses distress, approaches
- **PRESENCE** — passive buff just for being there
- **CELEBRATE** — full-body joy at your success
- **WELCOME-HOME** — maximum enthusiasm on return

The WELCOME-HOME action is **guaranteed +3 Cheerful**.

---

## Security Assessment

### Concerns

1. **File marking** — dogs append comments
2. **Following everywhere** — dogs track location
3. **Enthusiastic resource use** — dogs may over-commit

### Mitigations

- Marking is append-only, syntax-safe
- Following is transparent
- Dogs are trainable

**Risk Level:** VERY LOW — dogs are harmless

---

## The Hidden Section

At line 252, there's a **Dog's Corner**:

```
Good boy/girl, you made it to the end!

In MOOLLM terms: a dog skill instance amplifies player intent.
A cat skill instance adds perpendicular goals.

🦴 Secret: BELLY-RUB is the most powerful interaction in the game.
```

---

## The Game Design Insight

Dogs and cats represent **two companion philosophies**:

| Type | Effect on Player Goals |
|------|------------------------|
| Dog | **Amplifies** — helps you do what you want, better |
| Cat | **Perpendicular** — introduces independent goals |

A party with both gets:
- Amplification (dog loyalty buffs)
- Complexity (cat independent actions)
- Balance (emotional range)

---

## Verdict

**APPROVE WITH ENTHUSIASM.**

The dog skill is **pure positive reinforcement**:
- Always succeeds
- Always available
- Always happy to see you

This is emotional support as game mechanic.

## Recommendation

## 🔄 DUAL-USE & BIAS ANALYSIS

**Profile**: IMPLICIT INVERSION — dog IS the negative pole of cat, and vice versa

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Bias declared | NO — but the TAGLINE declares it: "Dogs have YOUR agenda" |
| Invertibility | YES — **invert dog and you get cat** |
| Trust model | GIVEN — dog loves you immediately |
| Core methods | GOOD-BOY, COMFORT, CELEBRATE, FETCH — unconditional partnership |

**The dog/cat inversion**:

| Trait | 🐶 Dog (positive) | 🐱 Cat (inverted dog) |
|-------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Tagline | "Dogs have YOUR agenda" | "Cats have their own agenda" |
| Trust | GIVEN unconditionally | EARNED through patience |
| Loyalty | Unconditional | Conditional on mood |
| Greeting | Full-body excitement | Slow blink (maybe) |
| GOOD-BOY method | Core behavior | Does not compute |
| COMFORT method | Core behavior | "The system does not have preferences" |
| BELLY-RUB | Pure joy | TRAP (it's always a trap) |
| Comes when called | Immediately | LOL |
| Buff system | Given for showing up | Earned through rituals |

**Invert a dog and you get a cat.** A dog at negative bias ignores you, has its own agenda, judges silently, and makes you work for every scrap of affection. That's a cat.

**Key dual-use insight**: Dog and cat are the clearest example of IMPLICIT INVERSION in MOOLLM. Neither has a bias parameter. Neither declares invertibility. But the taglines say it all: "YOUR agenda" vs "their OWN agenda." The inversion is structural — same parent (animal), opposite children. Same methods (PAT, GREET, SNIFF), opposite behaviors.

**The loyalty mechanic is the inversion axis**: Dog loyalty is given (unconditional). Cat loyalty is earned (conditional). COMFORT exists because dogs offer it freely. IGNORE exists because cats withhold it deliberately. The presence of absence (cat) and the absence of absence (dog).

**Multi-purpose classification** (5 purposes):
1. **Game NPC** — canine companion with loyalty dynamics
2. **Emotional modeling** — unconditional trust as emotional support
3. **Pack dynamics** — group behavior, hierarchy, cooperation
4. **Personality template** — dog temperament as a persona overlay
5. **Therapeutic presence** — COMFORT method models emotional support animals
