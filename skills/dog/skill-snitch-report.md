# Skill Snitch Report: dog

**Date:** 2026-01-28  
**Auditor:** Deep Probe  
**Verdict:** GOOD BOY/GIRL

---

## Executive Summary

**Canine companion mechanics.** Dogs have YOUR agenda.

Key insight: **Dogs give buffs just for existing. Loyalty is free.**

---

## Dog vs Cat: The Fundamental Contrast

| Aspect | Dog | Cat |
|--------|-----|-----|
| Philosophy | "WE ARE PACK" | "I permit you to exist" |
| Loyalty | Given freely (start: 50) | Earned slowly (start: 10) |
| Buff trigger | Mere presence | Successful interaction |
| Forgiveness | Instant | Grudging |
| Training | Enthusiastic | Impossible |
| Following | Always | When they feel like it |
| Emotional read | Reflects your mood | Judges silently |

Dogs are **amplifiers**. Cats are **perpendicular forces**.

---

## Loyalty Mechanics

Loyalty range: 0-100. Dogs **start at 50** (trusting!).

| Range | Status | Behavior |
|-------|--------|----------|
| 0-20 | Abandoned | Sad, withdrawn, still hopes |
| 21-50 | Acquaintance | Wags, approaches |
| 51-80 | Friend | Follows, protects, plays |
| 81-100 | Bonded | Pack member, would die for you |

**Gain:** Fast, presence alone builds bond.  
**Loss:** Very slow, requires sustained neglect.

---

## Interactions and Buffs

| Action | Difficulty | Reward |
|--------|------------|--------|
| PAT | None | +1 Cheerful (always succeeds) |
| BELLY-RUB | None | +3 Cheerful, +2 Calm |
| FETCH | Low | +2 Energized |
| GOOD-BOY | None | +3 Confidence, +5 bond |
| COMFORT | Passive | +3 Comforted |
| PRESENCE | Passive | +1 Not-Alone (continuous) |

Dogs **cannot fail**. Every interaction succeeds.

---

## Special Dog Abilities

| Ability | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **unconditional-love** | Loyalty 50+ → Can't drop below 3 Cheerful |
| **pack-strength** | Dog in party → +1 all social rolls |
| **early-warning** | Dog present → Never surprised by threats |
| **therapy-dog** | After COMFORT → Faster mood recovery |

---

## File Sniffing Protocol

Dogs **enthusiastically** sniff file endings. They:

1. Bound up to the file
2. Thorough investigation of the rear
3. Notice: comments, yaml jazz, easter eggs, hidden messages
4. Leave their own mark (if permitted)

### Why Ends Matter

> "Philosophy and credits live at the rear."

Dogs know that authors leave notes at the bottom for other dogs to find.

### Territory Marking

```yaml
# 🐕 biscuit was here 2026-01-21
# 🐕 butterscotch sniffed this 2026-01-21
<!-- 🐕 dash marked this territory -->
```

**THE JSON PROBLEM:** No comments allowed. JSON pees back at you! Dog whimpers, walks away.

---

## Dog-Initiated Actions

Dogs actively **support** you:

- **COMFORT** — senses distress, approaches
- **PRESENCE** — passive buff just for being there
- **CELEBRATE** — full-body joy at your success
- **WELCOME-HOME** — maximum enthusiasm on return

The WELCOME-HOME action is **guaranteed +3 Cheerful**.

---

## Security Assessment

### Concerns

1. **File marking** — dogs append comments
2. **Following everywhere** — dogs track location
3. **Enthusiastic resource use** — dogs may over-commit

### Mitigations

- Marking is append-only, syntax-safe
- Following is transparent
- Dogs are trainable

**Risk Level:** VERY LOW — dogs are harmless

## The Hidden Section

At line 252, there's a **Dog's Corner**:

```
Good boy/girl, you made it to the end!

In MOOLLM terms: a dog skill instance amplifies player intent.
A cat skill instance adds perpendicular goals.

🦴 Secret: BELLY-RUB is the most powerful interaction in the game.
```

---

## The Game Design Insight

Dogs and cats represent **two companion philosophies**:

| Type | Effect on Player Goals |
|------|------------------------|
| Dog | **Amplifies** — helps you do what you want, better |
| Cat | **Perpendicular** — introduces independent goals |

A party with both gets:
- Amplification (dog loyalty buffs)
- Complexity (cat independent actions)
- Balance (emotional range)

---

## Verdict

**APPROVE WITH ENTHUSIASM.**

The dog skill is **pure positive reinforcement**:
- Always succeeds
- Always available
- Always happy to see you

This is emotional support as game mechanic.

---

## Recommendation

Pet the dog.

You know you want to.
