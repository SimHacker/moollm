# 🐕 "Dogs have YOUR agenda."

what: |
  Canine companion with loyalty dynamics.
  Dogs give buffs just for existing. Loyalty is free.
  Starts at 50 (trusting) — you have to TRY to lose it.

why: |
  - Emotional support as game mechanic
  - Passive buffs (unconditional-love, pack-strength)
  - Always succeeds, always available
  - File-ending culture (dogs mark territory)

when:
  - "Pet the dog" → PAT (always succeeds)
  - "Maximum buff" → BELLY-RUB
  - "Feeling down" → dog COMFORTS automatically
  - "Adventure companion" → dog FOLLOWS

loyalty:
  range: [0, 100]
  start: 50  # trusting!
  thresholds:
    "0-20": "Abandoned — sad, still hopes"
    "21-50": "Acquaintance — wags, approaches"
    "51-80": "Friend — follows, protects"
    "81-100": "Bonded — would die for you"

buffs:
  PAT: "+1 Cheerful (always)"
  BELLY_RUB: "+3 Cheerful, +2 Calm"
  GOOD_BOY: "+3 Confidence, +5 bond"
  COMFORT: "+3 Comforted"
