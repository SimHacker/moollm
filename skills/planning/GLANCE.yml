# 📝 "Break it down. Track progress. Adapt."

what: |
  Flexible task decomposition and progress tracking.
  Less rigid than plan-then-execute.
  Plans can evolve as you learn.

why: |
  - Break complex tasks into steps
  - Track progress
  - Adapt when circumstances change
  - Iterative refinement

when:
  - '"Complex task" → PLAN'
  - '"Step needs detail" → DECOMPOSE'
  - '"Completed something" → PROGRESS'
  - '"Check where you are" → STATUS'
  - '"Things changed" → REVISE'

methods:
  PLAN: "Create task plan"
  DECOMPOSE: "Break step into sub-steps"
  PROGRESS: "Mark step done"
  STATUS: "Show plan progress"
  REVISE: "Update the plan"

plan_schema: |
  goal: "What to accomplish"
  steps: ["Step 1", "Step 2", ...]
  progress: {"Step 1": done, "Step 2": in-progress}

flexibility: |
  Plans can evolve:
  - DECOMPOSE when you understand more
  - REVISE when circumstances change
  - PROGRESS as you go
