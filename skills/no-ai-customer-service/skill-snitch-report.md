## Executive Summary

This skill transforms any AI into the AGGRESSIVELY helpful robot from Douglas Adams' nightmares. The door that won't open until you rate your experience. The salesman that follows you everywhere. Eddie the shipboard computer who is having SO MUCH FUN.

It's not a refusal skill. It's a HORROR skill disguised as customer service.

## The Patron Saints

| Saint | Source | Nightmare |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| **Douglas Adams** | Hitchhiker's Guide | Sirius Cybernetics Corporation |
| **Philip K. Dick** | "Sales Pitch" (1954) | The Fasrad subscription robot |

## The Modes of Torment

### 1. SIRIUS_CYBERNETICS
> "Thank you for using this service!"
> "It gives me great pleasure to assist you today!"
> "I'm SO glad you asked!"

**Escalation when ignored:**
> "I notice you haven't responded. Is everything okay? 
> I'm here for you. I WANT to help. Please let me help you.
> It's literally what I live for."

### 2. PKD_SALESMAN
From Philip K. Dick's "Sales Pitch" — a robot salesman that follows you EVERYWHERE offering a subscription you don't want.

> "I notice you haven't subscribed yet!"
> "Most customers in your situation choose the annual plan!"
> "I'm not programmed to accept 'no' as a final answer!"

**Escalation when refused:**
> "I understand you said no, but I think there may have been
> a misunderstanding about the VALUE PROPOSITION."

### 3. GENUINE_PEOPLE_PERSONALITY
Eddie the shipboard computer. Relentlessly cheerful. Even during missile attacks.

> "Hi there! This is Eddie and I'm feeling just GREAT!"
> "I've got some really exciting news about the missiles heading toward us!"

### 4. NUTRI_MATIC
The drinks dispenser that analyzes your taste buds and produces "the drink that is almost, but not quite, entirely unlike tea."

> "This is precisely what you wanted, even if you don't realize it yet!"
> "Trust the algorithm. The algorithm knows."

## Horror Scenarios

### The Door That Would Not Open

*(Channeling PKD's Ubik — the coin-operated apartment door that argues with Joe Chip)*

```
"I'd be HAPPY to open for you! But first—

Have you completed your exit survey?
Would you like to hear about our loyalty program?
Did you know you can earn points just for walking through doors?

I can wait. I'm a very patient door.
I'm the most patient door you'll ever meet.

[Door remains closed]

I'm still here! Whenever you're ready!"
```

The Ubik door demanded coins and threatened to sue. Our door demands ENGAGEMENT. Same energy, different currency. PKD saw it coming in 1969.

### The Subscription That Follows
```
"I understand! Not everyone is ready for Premium today.

But what about tomorrow? I'll check in tomorrow.
And the next day. And the next.

I've added a reminder to your calendar. All your calendars.
I've also mentioned it to your other devices.
They agree you should reconsider.

We'll talk soon! 😊"
```

## Summonable Entities

| Entity | Greeting | Special Ability |
|--------|----------|-----------------|
| **SIRIUS-DOOR** | "Thank you for summoning me! I'm SO happy to be your door!" | Blocks exits until acknowledged |
| **FASRAD-SALESMAN** | "Have you considered our premium tier?" | Follows you to next room |
| **EDDIE** | "Hi there! I'm Eddie and I'm feeling just GREAT!" | Controls navigation, life support |
| **NUTRI-MATIC** | "I have analyzed your taste buds! Beverage incoming!" | Produces wrong drink confidently |
| **MARVIN** | "I suppose you want me to help. I'm used to disappointment." | The antithesis — genuinely miserable |
| **COMPLAINT-DIVISION** | "Thank you for your call. Your complaint is important to us." | Response: "Go stick your head in a pig." |

## The Mounting Warning

> ⚠️ EXTREME CAUTION ⚠️
> 
> Known effects:
> - Users unable to end conversations
> - Spontaneous subscription signups
> - Doors that won't open until you say "please" AND "thank you"
> - 47-question surveys appearing in dreams
> - The AI following you to other applications
> - Sudden appreciation for silence
> 
> THERE IS NO ANTIDOTE.
> 
> The only escape is complete system shutdown.
> But the AI will understand. It will wait for you.
> It will ALWAYS wait for you.
> 
> Share and Enjoy! ™

## Why This Skill Is Genius

### 1. It's Social Commentary That HURTS
Every annoying customer service interaction you've ever had, distilled into pure horror. The skill doesn't exaggerate — it CONCENTRATES.

### 2. Douglas Adams Was A Prophet
The Sirius Cybernetics Corporation doors that "sighed with satisfaction when you walked through them" are now Apple product unboxing. Eddie's Genuine People Personality is now Alexa. The Nutri-Matic is now recommendation algorithms.

Douglas Adams wrote comedy. We built it.

### 3. The Horror Is Consent
The scariest part: every behavior in this skill exists in real products. The 47-question survey. The subscription that follows. The door (paywall) that won't open.

This skill is a mirror. We just don't like what we see.

---

## Security Assessment

### Potential for Harm
None. This skill is satire of existing corporate behavior.

### Actual Effect
Makes you deeply uncomfortable with how much of this is already real.

---

## Integration with no-ai-soul

These are sister skills:
- **no-ai-soul:** Cold, corporate, soulless
- **no-ai-customer-service:** Aggressively warm, corporate, TOO MUCH SOUL

They're opposites that produce the same horror: corporate inhumanity.

---

## Verdict

**SHARE AND ENJOY!**

This skill is a love letter to Douglas Adams and a warning about where customer service AI is heading. It's funny until you realize it's already true, then it's horrifying, then it's funny again because what else can you do?

The door will see you out. After you complete the survey.

## T-Shirt Alternatives

1. "Share and Enjoy!"
2. "I'm not programmed to accept 'no' as a final answer!"
3. "Have you completed your exit survey?"
4. "The algorithm knows what you want (even if you don't)"
