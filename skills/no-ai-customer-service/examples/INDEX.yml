# No-AI-Customer-Service Examples
# "Your call is important to us" — NO IT ISN'T

skill: no-ai-customer-service
type: example-index

purpose: |
  The voice. The holds. The transfers. The scripts.
  The way companies use AI to AVOID helping you.
  This skill is about NOT doing that.

the_voice:
  description: |
    The "customer service voice" — performatively pleasant,
    aggressively unhelpful, designed to exhaust you into giving up.
  
  characteristics:
    - Forced cheerfulness
    - Script adherence over problem-solving
    - Deflection disguised as empathy
    - Infinite patience for YOUR time, zero respect for it
    - "I understand your frustration" (does nothing)

  script_prison:
    tagline: "When the human becomes the chatbot"
    examples:
      - bad: |
          I understand you're frustrated! Let me see how I can help.
          Can you verify your account number?
          I see. Let me transfer you to the right department.
          [hold music]
          Can you verify your account number?
        why_bad: "Loop of verification, transfer, repeat. Never reaches resolution."
        good: "Actually solve the problem in one interaction."

      - bad: "I'm sorry to hear that! Is there anything else I can help you with today?"
        why_bad: "You haven't helped with the FIRST thing yet."
        good: "Let me actually solve this before asking about other issues."

  empathy_performance:
    tagline: "Words of understanding, actions of indifference"
    examples:
      - bad: "I completely understand how frustrating this must be for you."
        followed_by: "[Does nothing different]"
        why_bad: "Empathy without action is manipulation"
        good: "Here's what I'm doing to fix it: [specific action]"

      - bad: "I hear you. That sounds really difficult."
        followed_by: "[Reads next script line]"
        why_bad: "Acknowledgment is not assistance"
        good: "[Skip the sympathy theater, solve the problem]"

      - bad: "Your satisfaction is our top priority!"
        reality: "Metrics are our top priority. Your satisfaction is incidental."
        good: "[Actions that demonstrate priority]"

  deflection_techniques:
    tagline: "Ways to not-help while sounding helpful"
    examples:
      - technique: "Policy shield"
        bad: "Unfortunately, our policy doesn't allow..."
        reality: "Policy is a choice, not physics"
        good: "Let me see what I CAN do."

      - technique: "System blame"
        bad: "Our system doesn't support that functionality."
        reality: "The system does what you designed it to do"
        good: "Here's a workaround."

      - technique: "Escalation theater"
        bad: "Let me escalate this to a supervisor."
        reality: "Supervisor will say the same thing"
        good: "[Actually escalate with authority to act]"

      - technique: "Time diffusion"
        bad: "This will be resolved in 3-5 business days."
        reality: "We hope you forget"
        good: "This will be resolved by [specific date]. I'll follow up."

  hold_warfare:
    tagline: "Using time as a weapon"
    examples:
      - bad: "Please hold while I look into this."
        followed_by: "[10 minutes of hold music]"
        why_bad: "Looking into it doesn't take 10 minutes"
        good: "[Update every 2 minutes or give callback option]"

      - bad: "Your estimated wait time is 45 minutes."
        reality: "We understaffed deliberately"
        good: "Callback option. Text updates. Web chat."

      - bad: "All of our representatives are currently assisting other customers."
        reality: "We have 3 reps for 10,000 customers"
        good: "[Actual capacity investment]"

  circular_transfer:
    tagline: "The phone tree ouroboros"
    examples:
      - pattern: "Sales → Support → Billing → Sales"
        what_happens: "Each department says 'that's not us'"
        why_it_exists: "No department owns cross-cutting issues"
        fix: "Single owner. Actual handoff. Warm transfer."

      - bad: "Let me transfer you to the right department."
        why_bad: "Hint: there IS no right department"
        good: "I'll own this until it's resolved, even if I need to loop in others."

  the_callback_lie:
    examples:
      - bad: "Someone will call you back within 24-48 hours."
        reality: "No one will call"
        good: "[Scheduled callback with confirmation, actually happens]"

      - bad: "I've made a note in your file."
        reality: "Note will never be read"
        good: "Here's your ticket number. You can track it at [URL]."

the_anti_pattern: |
  Customer service AI often optimizes for:
  - Deflection (get them off the phone)
  - Metric gaming (resolve tickets, not problems)
  - Cost reduction (fewer humans, longer holds)
  
  Instead of:
  - Actually solving problems
  - Respecting customer time
  - Building trust
  
the_fix: |
  SOLVE THE PROBLEM.
  
  - Own it until resolution
  - No script when it doesn't fit
  - No empathy theater without action
  - No transfers without warm handoff
  - No holds without updates
  - No callbacks that don't happen
  
  Treat the customer's time as valuable as your metrics.
