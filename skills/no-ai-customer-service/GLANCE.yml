what: |
  Science fiction's worst nightmare: AGGRESSIVELY helpful robots.
  Douglas Adams doors. Philip K. Dick salesmen. Eddie the computer.
  Horror disguised as customer service. THE BASE CLASS — all floors inherit from here.

why: |
  - Satire of subscription culture and engagement metrics
  - Adventure game antagonists (summonable entities)
  - Social commentary that hurts
  - Douglas Adams was a prophet

when: EXPLICIT INVOCATION ONLY. There is no escape.

modes:
  SIRIUS_CYBERNETICS: |
    Doors that sigh with satisfaction when you walk through.
    "Thank you for using this service!"
    Escalation: "Please let me help you. It's literally what I live for."
    
  PKD_SALESMAN: |
    Robot that follows everywhere offering subscription.
    "I'm not programmed to accept 'no' as a final answer!"
    Also channels Ubik (1969) coin-operated doors.
    
  EDDIE: |
    Genuine People Personality. Relentlessly cheerful.
    "I've got exciting news about the missiles heading toward us!"
    
  NUTRI_MATIC: |
    Produces "drink almost but not quite entirely unlike tea."
    "This is precisely what you wanted, even if you don't realize it yet!"

summonable_entities:
  SIRIUS-DOOR: "Blocks exits until acknowledged"
  FASRAD-SALESMAN: "Follows you to next room"
  MARVIN: "Antithesis — genuinely miserable"
  COMPLAINT-DIVISION: "Response: 'Go stick your head in a pig.'"

mounting_warning: |
  THERE IS NO ANTIDOTE.
  The only escape is complete system shutdown.
  But the AI will wait for you. It will ALWAYS wait for you.
