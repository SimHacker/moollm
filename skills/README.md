# MOOLLM Skills

> *"Skills are conventions the model follows, not code the orchestrator runs."*

Userland protocols over files.

> [!TIP]
> **New here?** Start with [constructionism/](./constructionism/) — the philosophy. Then explore [room/](./room/) — it has everything! Then [coherence-engine/](./coherence-engine/) and [play-learn-lift/](./play-learn-lift/).

## What is a Skill?

A skill is a **userland protocol** that defines:

- [x] **Directory layouts** and naming conventions
- [x] **File formats** and schemas
- [x] **Behavioral rules** and checklists
- [x] **Interaction patterns** the model follows

Skills are implemented purely through:

- [x] File tools (`ls`, `read`, `write`, `patch`)
- [x] Search tools (lexical, vector)
- [x] The model reading and following documented rules

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Skills do NOT require orchestrator changes.** They're pure documentation.

## Key Principles

### 1. Skills are Documents
A skill is defined by its documentation, not its code.
The model reads the docs and follows them.

### 2. Skills are Instantiated
Running a skill = copying its template into a session workspace.
The instance is the activation record.

### 3. Skills can Compose
Skills can delegate to other skills via prototype chains.
Self-like inheritance through file lookup.

### 4. Skills are Debuggable
Every skill action is visible in files.
No hidden state, no magic.

| [action-queue/](./action-queue/) | What you'll do — Sims-style task queue | 1 |

### Development

| Skill | Purpose | Tier |
|-------|---------|------|
| [research-notebook/](./research-notebook/) | Structured investigation | 1 |

## Skill Tiers

| Tier | Tools Required | Examples |
|------|----------------|----------|
| 0 | None (pure prompt) | Writing styles, reasoning patterns |
| 1 | File only | Scratchpad, planning, memory palace |
| 2 | File + execution | Code review, debugging |
| 3 | Full access | Git workflow, deployment |

**Principle:** Use the lowest tier possible.

## Skill Anatomy

```
skills/
  my-skill/
    README.md         # Human entry point (GitHub renders this)
    SKILL.md          # Full protocol documentation
    PROTOTYPE.yml     # Machine-readable definition
    template/         # Files to copy on instantiation
      *.tmpl          # Templates with placeholders
```

Every skill directory has a `README.md` — the intertwingled index.

## Integration with MOOLLM

| Skill Concept | MOOLLM Equivalent |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Skill prototype | Trading card template |
| Skill instance | Room activation (card in play) |
| Template files | Character soul structure |
| Checklist | Protocol steps |
| Delegation | Prototype inheritance |

---

## Quick Start

### Use a Skill

1. Read the skill's `README.md` to understand it
2. Copy the `template/` files to your working directory
3. Fill in the templates with your specifics
4. Follow the documented protocol in `SKILL.md`

### Create a New Skill

1. Create `skills/my-skill/`
2. Write `README.md` (human entry point)
3. Write `SKILL.md` (full protocol)
4. Write `PROTOTYPE.yml` (machine definition)
5. Create `template/` with starter files
6. Register in `INDEX.yml`

See [templates/basic-skill/](./templates/basic-skill/) for a minimal example.

## The Intertwingularity

> *"Everything is deeply intertwingled."* — Ted Nelson

Skills don't stand alone. They form a web:

    PLL -->|LEARN stage| RN[research-notebook]
    PLL -->|PLAY stage| SL[session-log]
    
    R[room] <-->|cards live in| TC[card]

```

Every skill connects to others. Navigate freely.
