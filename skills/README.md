## Seven Architectural Improvements

MOOLLM extends [Anthropic's skill model](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prompt-library) with seven innovations:

| # | Extension | What It Adds | Proof |
|---|-----------|--------------|-------|
| 1 | **Instantiation** | Skills as prototypes creating instances. Not just prompts — living programs. | [`adventure/`](./adventure/) → [`adventure-4/`](../examples/adventure-4/) with 150+ files |
| 2 | **Multi-Tier Persistence** | Platform (ephemeral) → Narrative (append) → State (edit) → MOO-Maps (GLANCE/CARD/SKILL/README/examples/templates/source). | [6000+ line session logs](../examples/adventure-4/characters/real-people/don-hopkins/sessions/marathon-session.md), persistent room state |
| 3 | **K-lines** | Names as semantic activation vectors (Minsky). | "[Palm](../examples/adventure-4/characters/animals/monkey-palm/)" activates entire soul, history, relationships |
| 4 | **Empathic Templates** | Smart generation, not string substitution. | [Biscuit's](../examples/adventure-4/characters/animals/dog-biscuit/) description generated from traits |
| 5 | **Speed of Light** | Many turns in one call, minimal tokenization. | [33-turn Fluxx](../examples/adventure-4/characters/real-people/don-hopkins/sessions/marathon-session.md), [21-turn cat prowl](../examples/adventure-4/characters/real-people/don-hopkins/sessions/marathon-session.md) |
| 6 | **CARD.yml** | Machine-readable interface with advertisements. | Every skill exposes methods, tools, state schema — see [card/](./card/) |
| 7 | **Ethical Framing** | Room-based inheritance of performance context. | [`pub/stage/`](../examples/adventure-4/pub/stage/) inherits `framing: performance` |

**The key insight:** Skills aren't documentation. They're programs. The LLM is `eval()`.

## Skill Tiers

| Tier | Tools Required | Examples |
|------|----------------|----------|
| 0 | None (pure prompt) | Writing styles, reasoning patterns |
| 1 | File read/write | Most skills |
| 2 | + Terminal | Debugging, code-review |

**Principle:** Use the lowest tier possible.

---

## Skill Anatomy (Required Structure)

```
skills/
  my-skill/
    README.md         # Human entry point (GitHub renders this)
    SKILL.md          # Full spec with YAML frontmatter
    CARD.yml          # Machine-readable interface definition
    *.tmpl            # Optional: templates at root level
```

Every skill has **three required files**:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `README.md` | Quick overview, links (GitHub renders this) |
| `SKILL.md` | Full protocol with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `tier`, `allowed-tools`) |
| `CARD.yml` | Interface definition: methods, tools, state, advertisements |

---

## Quick Start

### Use a Skill

1. Read the skill's `README.md`
2. Read `SKILL.md` for full protocol
3. Copy `*.tmpl` files to your working directory
4. Follow the documented protocol

### Create a New Skill

1. Create `skills/my-skill/` directory
2. Copy templates from `skills/skill/`:
   - `README.md.tmpl` → `README.md`
   - `SKILL.md.tmpl` → `SKILL.md`
3. Create `CARD.yml` with methods, tools, state
4. Fill in template variables
5. Register in `INDEX.yml`

Or just tell the LLM: "Create a new skill called 'my-skill' using the skill skill."

---

## Meta Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [INDEX.yml](./INDEX.yml) | Machine-readable skill registry |
| [ROOM.yml](./ROOM.yml) | The Skill Nexus — this directory as a metaphysical room |
| [skill/](./skill/) | The meta-skill with templates and protocols |

---

## 🚪 The Skill Nexus as Shared Space

This `skills/` directory is a **shared room** accessible from any adventure. Unlike adventure-specific rooms, it lives at the repo root and connects to ALL adventures.

### Path Variables

Instead of counting `../../../` levels, use **path variables** that resolve at runtime. See [kernel/NAMING.yml](../kernel/NAMING.yml) for the full specification.

| Variable | Resolves To | Use Case |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **REPO-SCOPED** | *Shared across all adventures* | |
| `$REPO/` | `moollm/` | Repository root |
| `$SKILLS/` | `moollm/skills/` | Skill definitions |
| `$KERNEL/` | `moollm/kernel/` | Core protocols |
| `$DESIGNS/` | `moollm/designs/` | Architecture docs |
| **ADVENTURE-SCOPED** | *Plugged in at runtime* | |
| `$ADVENTURE/` | Current adventure | From startup.yml |
| `$CHARACTERS/` | `$ADVENTURE/characters/` | Character alcoves |
| `$ANIMALS/` | `$CHARACTERS/animals/` | Animal sanctuary |
| `$PERSONAS/` | `$ADVENTURE/personas/` | Mask wardrobe |
| `$PUB/` | `$ADVENTURE/pub/` | The gathering place |
| `$COATROOM/` | `$ADVENTURE/coatroom/` | Transformation room |
| `$START/` | `$ADVENTURE/start/` | Origin point |

**Dynamic Binding:** Skills use `$ANIMALS/dog-biscuit/` — adventure provides the concrete path.
Two-way links dovetail: skill→adventure and adventure→skill resolve consistently.

### Example Usage

```yaml
# In skills/ROOM.yml — back-links to adventure
exits:
  coatroom:
    destination: $COATROOM/
    
relationships:
  maurice:
    location: $COATROOM/mannequin.yml
    
# In adventure YAML — forward-links to skills
exits:
  east:
    destination: $SKILLS/
```

### Concrete Resolution (when adventure-4 is active)

| Path Variable | Resolves To |
|---------------|-------------|
| `$COATROOM/mirror.yml` | `examples/adventure-4/coatroom/mirror.yml` |
| `$CHARACTERS/animals/monkey-palm/` | `examples/adventure-4/characters/animals/monkey-palm/` |
| `$SKILLS/character/` | `skills/character/` |

Every skill connects to others. The foundation defines how skills work. Format shapes how data flows. Ambient skills shape every output. Characters live in rooms, advertise actions, and are managed by simulations. Deliberation debates simulation outcomes. Introspection watches it all. Methodology records what happens. Navigate freely.
