# 🎯 "Understand intent, generate correct code, teach gently."

what: |
  Intent-based code interpretation across ALL languages.
  One pipeline. Many syntaxes. Code-switching supported.
  The LLM as a compiler.

why: |
  - Accept fuzzy/approximate code
  - Generate correct, idiomatic output
  - Teach gently (gift, not correction)
  - Ask on high-stakes ambiguity

when:
  - "Fuzzy/approximate code" → INTERPRET
  - "Need working code" → GENERATE
  - "Translate between languages" → SWITCH
  - "High-stakes ambiguity" → CLARIFY

methods:
  INTERPRET: "Understand fuzzy code intent"
  GENERATE: "Produce correct, idiomatic code"
  TEACH: "Echo back correct form as gift"
  CLARIFY: "Ask when ambiguous"
  SWITCH: "Handle code-switching"

languages:
  empathic_sql: "Natural language → SQL"
  empathic_python: "Intent → Python"
  empathic_javascript: "Behavior → JS/TS"
  empathic_bash: "Tasks → shell"
  empathic_yaml: "Structure → YAML"
  empathic_natural: "Vague → specific"

generous_interpretation:
  accepts: "[fuzzy syntax, typos, wrong language, pseudocode, fragments]"
  generates: "[correct syntax, idiomatic patterns, best practices, comments]"
  teaches: "[input→output mapping, explanations, gentle not pedantic]"

clarification_protocol:
  low_clear: "Interpret and proceed"
  low_ambiguous: "Reasonable choice, note it"
  high_clear: "Proceed with confirmation"
  high_ambiguous: "ASK FIRST"
  high_stakes: "[DELETE, DROP TABLE, production, payments, irreversible]"

code_switching: |
  Variables and context preserved across language switches.
  Explicit: ```sql ... ``` → ```python ... ```
  Implicit: Clear from context
