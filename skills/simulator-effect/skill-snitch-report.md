# Skill Snitch Report: simulator-effect

**Date:** 2026-01-28  
**Auditor:** Deep Probe  
**Verdict:** THE MOST POWERFUL INSIGHT

---

## Executive Summary

**Implication is more efficient than simulation.**

Players imagine simulations are vastly more detailed than they actually are.
This is not a bug. **It's the most powerful rendering engine ever built.**

---

## The Core Insight

> Players imagine simulations are vastly more detailed, deep, rich, and complex than they actually are. This is not a bug to fix — it is the most powerful rendering engine ever built. Off-load computation into the user's brain. Provide seeds, not simulations.

**Will Wright's principle:** "He designs games to run on two computers at once — the one you bought, and the one behind your eyes."

---

## The Proof: The Astrological Effect (1997)

The Sims displayed zodiac signs with **zero behavioral code**.

Testers reported: "The zodiac is too influential. Can you tune it down?"

**There was nothing to tune.**

The influence was **entirely imagined**. The zodiac triggered mental models in players' heads that made them see patterns that weren't there.

## Methods

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **IMPLY** | Instead of simulating, imply |
| **SEED** | Provide imagination seeds |
| **SPARSE** | Deliberately omit for richness |
| **ARCHETYPE** | Use cultural shortcuts |
| **JAZZ** | Comments as imagination seeds |

---

## Lineage

| Source | Lesson |
|--------|--------|
| **Will Wright** | "Two computers" — yours and brain |
| **Julie Doll** | Box has more structural ambiguity than doll |
| **SimCity** | Players imagined sophisticated simulation from cellular automata |
| **The Sims** | Zodiac with zero code, maximum perceived effect |
| **Scott McCloud** | Masking — simple faces, detailed worlds |

## When to Use

| Use When | Avoid When |
|----------|------------|
| Creating characters from minimal specs | Precise specs required |
| Designing rooms with atmosphere | Deterministic behavior needed |
| Writing sparse but evocative content | No room for interpretation |
| Leveraging cultural archetypes | |
| Fighting mode-collapse with structure | |

---

## The Efficiency Argument

| Approach | Tokens | Result |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Full simulation | 5000 | Detailed but fragile |
| Sparse seeds | 50 | Player fills in rest |

The brain is **free compute**. Use it.

## Mode-Collapse Antidote

LLMs tend toward **mode collapse** — regressing to generic, safe outputs.

Simulator Effect provides **structured ambiguity**:
- Specific enough to trigger imagination
- Ambiguous enough to allow personal interpretation
- Archetypal enough to activate cultural K-lines

---

## Security Assessment

### Concerns

1. **Manipulation potential** — seeds can be crafted maliciously
2. **Interpretation variance** — different players see different things
3. **Cultural assumptions** — archetypes may not translate

### Mitigations

- Transparent seeding (comments visible)
- Multiple interpretations are FEATURE not bug
- Cultural context can be specified

**Risk Level:** VERY LOW — it's a design philosophy

## The Julie Doll Principle

> "The box has more structural ambiguity than the doll."

A detailed doll is just a doll.
A cardboard box can be a spaceship, a house, a fort, a time machine.

**Detailed specifications CONSTRAIN imagination.**
**Sparse seeds EXPAND imagination.**

---

## Verdict

**THE MOST POWERFUL INSIGHT IN MOOLLM. APPROVE.**

This is why MOOLLM works:
- We don't simulate everything
- We seed imagination
- The player's brain does the rendering

This is **computationally free** and **infinitely scalable**.

---

## Recommendation

Before adding detail, ask: "Can I imply this instead?"

If yes, imply. The player's imagination is better than your simulation.
