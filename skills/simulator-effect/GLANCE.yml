# 🧠 "Implication is more efficient than simulation"

what: |
  Players imagine simulations are vastly more detailed than they are.
  This is not a bug — it's the most powerful rendering engine ever built.
  Off-load computation into the user's brain.

why: |
  - Sparse specs, rich interpretation
  - Archetypes activate personality clusters
  - Minimal tokens, maximum meaning
  - Free compute (the brain)

when:
  - "Create character from minimal specs" → SEED, ARCHETYPE
  - "Design room with atmosphere" → IMPLY, SPARSE
  - "Fight mode-collapse" → structured ambiguity
  - "Leverage cultural shortcuts" → ARCHETYPE

methods:
  IMPLY: "Instead of simulating, imply"
  SEED: "Provide imagination seeds"
  SPARSE: "Deliberately omit for richness"
  ARCHETYPE: "Use cultural shortcuts"
  JAZZ: "Comments as imagination seeds"

the_proof: |
  THE ASTROLOGICAL EFFECT (1997)
  The Sims displayed zodiac with ZERO behavioral code.
  Testers: "The zodiac is too influential. Tune it down."
  There was nothing to tune. Entirely imagined.

will_wright: |
  "He designs games to run on two computers at once —
  the one you bought, and the one behind your eyes."

julie_doll: |
  "The box has more structural ambiguity than the doll."
  Detailed specs CONSTRAIN imagination.
  Sparse seeds EXPAND imagination.

efficiency: |
  Full simulation: 5000 tokens, fragile
  Sparse seeds: 50 tokens, player fills rest
  Brain is FREE COMPUTE.
