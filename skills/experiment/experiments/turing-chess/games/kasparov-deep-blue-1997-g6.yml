        One more push. One more chance.
        ...
        Wait.
        Wait, what am I looking at?
        That knight. That bishop. The rooks.
        I'm... I'm losing this, aren't I?
        How did this happen?
      narrator: |
        The human pushes a pawn. A small move.
        And then... stops.
        
        The human's hand hovers over the clock.
        Does not press it.
        
        Looks at the board. Again. And again.
        
        The audience holds its breath.

  - number: 19
    result: "0-1"
    method: "resignation"
    drama:
      resignation: true
      white-reaction: |
        (The human's hand moves. Not to a piece. To the king.)
        
        The king tips over.
        
        Silence.
        
        "I resign."
        
        (Barely audible. Almost a whisper.)
        
      black-reaction: |
        (The robot's camera lens adjusts slightly.)
        (A single LED blinks green.)
        
        "Game complete. Thank you for playing."
        
        (The mechanical arm returns to rest position.)
        
      audience: |
        Murmurs. Confusion. Then understanding.
        
        "The human... lost?"
        "The MACHINE won?"
        
        Someone in the back starts clapping.
        Others join. Uncertain. Respectful.
        
        In the front row, a chess expert stares at the board.
        Counting. Recounting. Finding nothing.
        
        "It was already over," she whispers. "Five moves ago."
        
      narrator: |
        And there it is.
        
        A human — one of the greatest players who ever lived,
        though the audience doesn't know that — 
        tips over their king and offers a hand
        to a machine that doesn't understand the gesture.
        
        The robot won.
        
        Not because it felt victory.
        Not because it wanted to win.
        Because it calculated.
        
        And in this game, on this day,
        calculation was enough.
        
        The audience files out slowly.
        Some excited. Some troubled.
        All of them wondering:
        
        What just happened?
        And what comes next?
