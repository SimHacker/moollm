# AlphaZero vs Stockfish (2017)
# "The day the machines learned a new way to think"
#
# Neural network vs traditional engine
# London, December 2017

game:
  id: alphazero-stockfish-2017-london
  name: "The London System Immortal"
  
  historical:
    white: "AlphaZero (DeepMind neural network)"
    black: "Stockfish 8 (traditional alpha-beta engine)"
    date: "2017-12-04"
    location: "Google DeepMind, London"
    event: "100-game match (AlphaZero won 28, drew 72, lost 0)"
    result: "1-0"
    significance: |
      AlphaZero, trained only through self-play with no human knowledge,
      defeated the world's strongest traditional chess engine.
      This game demonstrates AlphaZero's "alien" style: long-term positional
      sacrifices that traditional engines misevaluate.
      The match changed how we think about chess AI.

  what-makes-it-special:
    alphazero-style: |
      - Long-term positional play
      - Piece activity over material
      - "Human-like" intuition (learned, not programmed)
      - Evaluates 80,000 positions/second
    stockfish-style: |
      - Deep tactical calculation
      - Material-focused evaluation
      - Brute-force search
      - Evaluates 70,000,000 positions/second
      
  the-paradox: |
    Stockfish calculates 875x more positions per second than AlphaZero.
    AlphaZero still wins.
    
    Because knowing WHICH positions to evaluate matters more than
    evaluating ALL positions.
    
  key-moments:
    opening: "London System — quiet, positional"
    middle: "AlphaZero's knights dance, creating long-term weaknesses"
    endgame: "Stockfish's evaluation says it's equal. It isn't."
    resignation: "The pawn queens. Stockfish never saw it coming."
    
  audience-arc:
    opening: "Two robots playing... how exciting? (sarcasm)"
    middle: "Wait — one of them is playing... weirdly?"
    late-middle: "The neural network's pieces are so active..."
    endgame: "The traditional engine looks... confused?"
    resignation: "The NEW kind of AI just won. What does that mean?"
