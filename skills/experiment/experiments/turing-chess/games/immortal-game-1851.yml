      The most celebrated chess game in history. Anderssen sacrificed
      a bishop, both rooks, and his queen to deliver checkmate with
      only three minor pieces. Ernst Falkbeer named it "The Immortal Game"
      in 1855. Kieseritzky was so impressed he telegraphed the moves
      to the Café de la Régence in Paris.

dramatic-notes:
  theme: "Romantic era chess at its finest — attack, sacrifice, beauty over material"
  
  key-moments:
    move-4: "King moves instead of blocking — commitment to the attack"
    move-11: "Bishop left en prise — prioritizing initiative"
    move-18: "First rook sacrifice — the madness begins"
    move-19: "Second rook sacrifice — has he lost his mind?"
    move-22: "Queen sacrifice — three minor pieces to deliver mate"
    move-23: "Checkmate — with only 2 knights and a bishop remaining"
    
  audience-arc:
    opening: "Curious — aggressive opening"
    middle: "Confused — why not take the bishop?"
    sacrifice-1: "Shocked — did he just give away a rook?"
    sacrifice-2: "Stunned — ANOTHER rook?!"
    queen: "Disbelief — THE QUEEN?!"
    mate: "Awe — how is that checkmate?"

turing-chess-notes:
  robot-style: "Would never play this — material deficit is 'losing'"
  human-style: "Pure intuition and calculation — sees the mate"
  drama-potential: "Maximum — every sacrifice is a jaw-dropper"
  recommended-for: "Teaching that chess is art, not just calculation"
