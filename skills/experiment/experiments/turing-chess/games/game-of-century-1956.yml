dramatic-notes:
  theme: "Youth defeats experience through deep calculation and fearless sacrifice"
  
  key-moments:
    move-11: "Na4!! — Fischer's knight invades aggressively"
    move-17: "Be6!! — THE move. The queen can be taken but Fischer sees 8+ moves ahead"
    move-19-23: "The windmill — Fischer's king hunt with repeated checks"
    move-41: "Mate! A 13-year-old's triumph"
    
  the-queen-sacrifice:
    move: "17...Be6!!"
    why-it-works: |
      If Bxb6, then Bxc4+ starts a devastating combination:
      - Knight forks recover material
      - King gets hunted across the board
      - Fischer ends up with massive advantage
    what-byrne-saw: "A free queen"
    what-fischer-saw: "Checkmate in 24 moves"
    
  audience-arc:
    opening: "The kid is doing fine..."
    move-11: "Bold knight move — is that sound?"
    move-17: "Wait — his queen is hanging. Isn't it?"
    move-18-23: "OH MY GOD HE CALCULATED ALL THIS"
    endgame: "The master can't stop a 13-year-old"
    mate: "A star is born"

turing-chess-notes:
  prodigy-performance: "Fischer plays with preternatural calculation"
  master-collapse: "Byrne takes the 'free' queen and loses everything"
  recommended-for: "Showing that chess rewards deep calculation"
  human-drama: "David vs Goliath — and David wins"
