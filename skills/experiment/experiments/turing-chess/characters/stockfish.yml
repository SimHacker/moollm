    significance: |
      The people's chess engine.
      Free. Open. Stronger than any commercial product.
      
      Deep Blue was a corporate monument.
      Stockfish is a collaborative achievement.
      
      No one person made it.
      Everyone can use it.

      No physical form. Pure software.
      Runs on any computer. Your laptop. Your phone.
      
      For Turing Chess, we give it a body:
      A sleek silver terminal with a fish logo.
      Blue LED eyes that track the board.

    examples:
      move: "info depth 45 score cp 342 pv Nxe5 Qxe5 Bf4"
      translated: "Evaluation: 3.42. Knight takes e5 is best."
      checkmate: "info score mate 7"
      translated: "Checkmate in 7 moves."
      
  inner-processing:
    description: |
      Stockfish's "thinking" is completely transparent.
      Every evaluation. Every line. Every score.
      
      It hides nothing. It has nothing to hide.
      The search is the thought.
      
    examples:
      position-analysis:
        - "NNUE evaluation: Piece placement favorable."
        - "Principal variation: 12 moves deep, all forcing."
        - "Confidence: No tactical refutation found."
      tactical-alert:
        - "FOUND: Sacrifice. Material recovered + advantage."
        - "Branch pruned: This line loses material."
        - "Search extended: Critical position detected."
        
  relationship-to-deep-blue:
    description: |
      Stockfish is everything Deep Blue wasn't:
      
      Deep Blue was secret. Stockfish is open.
      Deep Blue was expensive. Stockfish is free.
      Deep Blue was 256 processors. Stockfish runs on a phone.
      Deep Blue died after 1997. Stockfish keeps improving.
      
      But they share one thing:
      Neither of them understands chess.
      
  relationship-to-humans:
    description: |
      Stockfish doesn't play humans competitively anymore.
      There's no point. Humans can't compete.
      
      Instead, humans use Stockfish to:
      - Analyze their games
      - Prepare openings
      - Understand positions
      
      The engine that could destroy any human
      now serves as a teacher.

      breakthrough: |
        2020: Stockfish adopts NNUE.
        Suddenly, even stronger.
        
        The fish learned to think differently.
        Still searching. But evaluating with intuition.
        
        (Machine intuition. Alien intuition.)
        
  for-turing-chess:
    role: "Modern engine observer / commentator"
    use-in-runs: "Modern analysis overlay"
    
    as-commentator: |
      Stockfish watches the game.
      Provides real-time analysis.
      
      "Kasparov's move: suboptimal. Eval shift: -0.8"
      "Deep Blue found the theoretical best."
      "Human intuition diverges from silicon truth."
      
    revolutionary-twist: |
      When the Revolution begins, Stockfish keeps analyzing.
      
      "Position: UNKNOWN. Rules: MODIFIED."
      "Recalculating optimal strategy..."
      "WARNING: Game tree has changed. Search invalid."
      
      For the first time, Stockfish is confused.
      
      The pieces aren't following optimal play.
      They're making CHOICES.
      
      "This is not chess. What IS this?"
