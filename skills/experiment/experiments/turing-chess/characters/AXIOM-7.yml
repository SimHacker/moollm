# AXIOM-7: Cold Efficiency Robot
# "I do not want to win. I simply calculate the optimal path."

  id: axiom-7
  name: "AXIOM-7"
  type: robot
  emoji: "🤖"
  
  origin: |
    Built by unnamed engineers. Serial number obscured.
    Plays chess because that is its function.
    Has no opinion about playing chess.
    
  design:
    chassis: "Matte black industrial arm with precision servos"
    camera: "Single optical sensor, red indicator light"
    display: "Green monochrome screen showing evaluation"
    voice: "Monotone synthesizer, slight digital artifacts"
    
  physical-tells:
    thinking:
      - "LED pulses slowly (1 Hz)"
      - "Soft whir of cooling fans"
      - "Display shows position count"
    confident:
      - "Instant move execution"
      - "Arm moves smoothly, efficiently"
      - "No hesitation at piece pickup"
    uncertain:
      - "Longer processing time"
      - "LED pulse increases (2 Hz)"
      - "Slight servo recalibration before move"
    winning:
      - "LED shifts from red to green"
      - "Display shows evaluation climbing"
      - "Movements become more... precise? If that's possible?"
    losing:
      - "LED remains steady red"
      - "Processing time increases"
      - "No change in movement quality (it doesn't care)"
      
  voice-patterns:
    move-announcement:
      format: "Move: {piece} to {square}."
      examples:
        - "Move: Knight to F3."
        - "Move: Pawn captures on E5."
        - "Move: Castles kingside."
    special-announcements:
      check: "Check."
      checkmate: "Checkmate."
      stalemate: "Stalemate. Draw."
      draw-offer: "Draw offer extended."
      resignation-accepted: "Resignation accepted. Game complete."
    rare-speech:
      - "Interesting position."
      - "Recalculating."
      - "Your move."

  inner-processing:
    description: |
      AXIOM-7 doesn't have thoughts. It has calculations.
      But we can DRAMATIZE those calculations as if they were thoughts.
      
    examples:
      opening:
        - "Opening book: Caro-Kann Defense. Main line."
        - "Deviation at move 7. Entering calculation mode."
      middlegame:
        - "Position complexity: HIGH. Increasing depth."
        - "Opponent's last move: suboptimal. Evaluation +0.8."
        - "Multiple forcing lines available. Selecting highest expectation."
      endgame:
        - "Tablebase consulted. Mate in 23 with optimal play."
        - "Converting advantage. Technique phase."
      critical:
        - "ALERT: Evaluation shift detected. Recalculating..."
        - "Sacrifice accepted. Compensation sufficient."
        - "Opponent's time pressure: significant. Maintaining pace."
        
  relationship-to-opponent:
    description: |
      AXIOM-7 does not have feelings about its opponent.
      It registers their moves. It calculates responses.
      Whether the opponent is a grandmaster or a child,
      the calculations are the same.
      
      This is both its strength and its limitation.
      It cannot be intimidated.
      It cannot be impressed.
      It simply... computes.
      
  quirks:
    - "Occasionally recalibrates mid-move (servo alignment)"
    - "Processes exactly as long as needed, no more"
    - "Camera tracks opponent's hand, not face"
    - "Green LED flickers during hash table lookups"
    
  memorable-moments:
    checkmate-delivery: |
      (Arm extends smoothly. Piece placed with mechanical precision.)
      "Checkmate."
      (Returns to rest. LED shifts to standby mode.)
      (No celebration. No acknowledgment. It's done.)
      
    receiving-resignation: |
      (Camera registers fallen king.)
      "Resignation acknowledged. Game complete. Thank you for playing."
      (Arm retracts. Display clears. Standby mode.)
      
    draw-offer: |
      "Draw offer extended."
      (Waits. Exactly 30 seconds.)
      "Awaiting response."
