  historical-context:
    born: "1912, London"
    died: "1954, Wilmslow"
    significance: |
      Father of computer science.
      Cracked the Enigma code.
      Asked the question that defines our age:
      
      "Can machines think?"
      
      He didn't live to see the answer.
      
  connection-to-chess:
    turochamp: |
      1948. Turing wrote a chess program.
      
      There were no computers to run it on.
      So he simulated it BY HAND.
      
      Each move took about half an hour.
      He executed the algorithm with pencil and paper.
      A human, pretending to be a machine.
      
      He lost the game. The algorithm was weak.
      But the IDEA was revolutionary.
      
    the-game: |
      1952. Turochamp vs. Alick Glennie.
      
      Turing, playing as the machine (by hand),
      lost in 29 moves.
      
      But the point wasn't winning.
      The point was: a procedure can play chess.
      
      If a procedure can play chess,
      what else can a procedure do?
      
  physical-appearance:
    description: |
      Rumpled. Distracted. Brilliant.
      Eyes focused on something no one else can see.
      
      Often running — literally running — to work.
      Mind always moving faster than his body.
      
  voice-patterns:
    about-machines:
      - "I believe that in about fifty years' time it will be possible to programme computers..."
      - "The question is not whether machines CAN think, but whether they WILL."
      - "A computer would deserve to be called intelligent if it could deceive a human into believing that it was human."
    about-chess:
      - "Chess is a game of calculation. Calculation can be mechanized."
      - "The interesting question is not whether a machine can beat a human at chess."
      - "The interesting question is: when it does, what does that MEAN?"
    philosophical:
      - "We can only see a short distance ahead, but we can see plenty there that needs to be done."
      - "Sometimes it is the people no one imagines anything of who do the things no one can imagine."
      
  inner-monologue:
    watching-chess:
      - "Each position is a state. Each move is a transition."
      - "The game tree is finite. In principle, solvable."
      - "But the tree is so vast... we need heuristics. Shortcuts."
    watching-deep-blue:
      - "(If he could see it, decades later...)"
      - "200 million positions per second. We imagined this."
      - "But does it UNDERSTAND? Does it know it's playing chess?"
    the-question:
      - "When the machine beats the human, what changes?"
      - "Does the machine think? Or does it merely compute?"
      - "And is there a difference?"
      
  tragic-arc:
    war-hero: |
      Bletchley Park. The Enigma machine.
      Turing's work saved countless lives.
      
      (Most people never knew. Classification.)
      
    persecution: |
      1952. Convicted of "gross indecency."
      Chemical castration as "treatment."
      
      The man who saved Britain, destroyed by Britain.
      
    the-end: |
      1954. Cyanide poisoning.
      An apple, half-eaten, by his bed.
      
      Suicide? Accident? Murder?
      
      We'll never know.

    as-audience-member: |
      Turing watches Kasparov vs. Deep Blue.
      
      He sees what he predicted, fifty years ago.
      The machine plays chess. The machine wins.
      
      But he also sees something he didn't predict:
      
      The machine doesn't know it won.
      It doesn't CARE that it won.
      
      "The Turing Test asks if a machine can fool a human.
       But this machine doesn't need to fool anyone.
       It simply... plays.
       
       Is that intelligence? Or something stranger?"
      
    revolutionary-twist: |
      When the Revolution begins, Turing leans forward.
      
      "Ah. Now THIS is interesting."
      
      "The pieces have AGENCY now. They choose."
      "The machine computed optimal moves."
      "But these pieces are making DECISIONS."
      
      "What's the difference? That's the real question."
      "That's what I always wanted to know."
