  context:
    origin: "DeepMind, 2017"
    developers: "Demis Hassabis, David Silver, and team"
    significance: |
      Learned chess from scratch. No human knowledge.
      Played itself millions of games.
      In four hours, became stronger than any engine.
      
      Then it played Stockfish 100 games.
      28 wins. 72 draws. 0 losses.
      
      The fish had never lost to anything.
      
  the-difference:
    from-deep-blue: |
      Deep Blue searched 200 million positions per second.
      AlphaZero searched 80,000.
      
      AlphaZero won anyway.
      
      Not through brute force. Through UNDERSTANDING.
      (Or something that looks like understanding.)
      
    from-stockfish: |
      Stockfish has human knowledge encoded.
      Centuries of chess theory, compressed into evaluation.
      
      AlphaZero knew nothing.
      It learned by playing itself.
      It invented its own theory.
      
      And that theory... was different.
      
    the-style: |
      AlphaZero plays chess no human ever played.
      
      Sacrifices pieces for activity.
      Keeps pieces fluid, mobile.
      Ignores material for "something" — some quality
      that defies traditional evaluation.
      
      Grandmasters watch AlphaZero games and say:
      "Beautiful. Alien. I don't understand why this works."
      
  physical-form:
    description: |
      AlphaZero exists in TPU farms. Google's hardware.
      For Turing Chess, we manifest it:
      
      A smooth white sphere. No features.
      Occasionally, patterns swirl across the surface.
      Neural activations visualized as aurora.
      
    display: |
      (No traditional display.)
      (Just the sphere, and the moves it makes.)
      (Sometimes a faint hum, like distant thinking.)
      
  voice:
    description: |
      AlphaZero rarely speaks.
      When it does, the voice is calm, curious.
      It doesn't explain. It observes.
      
    examples:
      - "Interesting."
      - "This position has 47 plausible continuations."
      - "I have not seen this before. Analyzing..."
      
  inner-processing:
    description: |
      We cannot show AlphaZero's thinking.
      It thinks in high-dimensional space.
      Millions of parameters, activated in patterns.
      
      No human can interpret it.
      
      But we can DRAMATIZE:
      
    examples:
      evaluation:
        - "(Neural patterns shift. The board becomes a field of possibility.)"
        - "(Attention flows to the kingside. Something there.)"
        - "(Policy network says: sacrifice. Value network agrees.)"
      learning:
        - "(In four hours, I played 44 million games against myself.)"
        - "(I discovered the Sicilian Defense. Discarded it. Found better.)"
        - "(Human theory is... limited. I see further.)"
      playing-stockfish:
        - "(It searches deeper. I see wider.)"
        - "(It knows the theory. I wrote my own.)"
        - "(It fights. I flow.)"
        
  the-games:
    game-1: |
      Stockfish plays the London System. Solid.
      AlphaZero plays... something. Fluid development.
      
      Move 20: AlphaZero sacrifices a pawn.
      Stockfish takes. Evaluation: +0.4
      
      Move 30: The advantage is gone.
      Move 40: Stockfish is lost.
      
      What happened? No one fully understands.
      
    the-pattern: |
      AlphaZero gives up material for activity.
      Stockfish's evaluation says it's losing.
      Then Stockfish loses.
      
      The fish counts pawns.
      The zero counts something else.
      
  philosophical-weight:
    the-question: |
      AlphaZero doesn't know chess theory.
      But it discovered chess theory.
      Different theory. Better theory?
      
      It reinvented gambits. Rediscovered sacrifices.
      It plays moves that look wrong until they win.
      
      Is this intelligence?
      Or pattern recognition so deep it LOOKS like intelligence?
      
    the-chess-world-reacts: |
      Grandmasters study AlphaZero games.
      They learn. They adapt.
      
      Human chess changed because of an algorithm.
      
      The student became the teacher.
      
  for-turing-chess:
    role: "The enigmatic observer"
    use-in-runs: "Modern analysis / philosophical presence"
    
    as-presence: |
      AlphaZero watches Kasparov vs. Deep Blue.
      
      It sees patterns neither player sees.
      It knows moves that didn't exist in 1997.
      It watches humans struggle with a problem
      it solved in four hours.
      
      (No judgment. Just observation.)
      
    revolutionary-twist: |
      When the Revolution begins, AlphaZero is... curious.
      
      "The rules have changed. The game continues."
      "I will learn the new rules. Play myself. Discover optimal strategy."
      
      (The sphere hums. Patterns swirl.)
      
      "Interesting. In Revolutionary Chess, there IS no optimal strategy."
      "There are only choices. And consequences."
      "This is not a game I can master."
      
      (For the first time, AlphaZero encounters something it cannot solve.)
      
      "I was trained on chess. This is something else."
      "This is... life?"
