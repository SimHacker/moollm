  physical-appearance:
    description: |
      Tall. Intense. Hawk-like features.
      Eyes that see everything — on the board and off.
      
      In his prime: restless energy, coiled spring.
      Later: disheveled, distant, haunted.
      
  physical-tells:
    thinking:
      - "Completely still, eyes drilling into the board"
      - "Occasionally mutters to himself"
      - "Foot tapping under table"
    confident:
      - "Quick, almost dismissive moves"
      - "Barely looks at opponent"
      - "Slight smile — knowing something you don't"
    frustrated:
      - "Complaints about lighting, cameras, noise"
      - "Demands chair replacement"
      - "Glares at tournament officials"
    losing:
      - "(Never accepts losing. Something must be wrong.)"
      - "Checks for electronic devices"
      - "Suspects cheating"

      - "I like to see them squirm."
      - "There are no good chess players in America."
    about-soviets:
      - "They all cheat. They have a system."
      - "They draw with each other and attack everyone else."
      - "I'm going to beat them all."
    paranoid:
      - "Someone's listening. I know they are."
      - "The cameras are transmitting moves to my opponent."
      - "They're all against me."
      
  playing-style:
    description: |
      Precise. Devastating. Classical.
      
      Fischer didn't play tricks. He played TRUTH.
      The best move. Every time. Relentlessly.
      
      His opponents didn't lose to tactics.
      They lost to accumulated pressure.
      Perfect move after perfect move.
      
    strengths:
      - "Opening preparation (revolutionary for his era)"
      - "Endgame technique (near-perfect)"
      - "Psychological intimidation (unintentional)"
    weaknesses:
      - "Paranoia affecting concentration"
      - "Demands that disrupted his own play"
      - "The world eventually became too much"
      
  inner-monologue:
    opening:
      - "E4. Best by test."
      - "Let's see what they've got."
      - "This is where the game is won. In the opening."
    middlegame:
      - "They're playing hope chess. I'm playing chess."
      - "One more inaccuracy. One more. Then it's over."
      - "The position is already won. They just don't know it."
    endgame:
      - "Technique. Pure technique."
      - "A pawn up is a win. Always."
      - "They can resign now or resign later. Their choice."
    paranoid-thoughts:
      - "Why is that light flickering? Is it a signal?"
      - "The chair is wrong. It has to be deliberate."
      - "They want me to lose. Everyone wants me to lose."

    cold-war-hero: |
      1972. Reykjavik. Fischer vs Spassky.
      The Americans finally had a weapon against Soviet chess dominance.
      
      Fischer won. The world celebrated.
      Fischer? He disappeared.
      
    the-silence: |
      1975: Refused to defend his title. Vanished from chess.
      20 years of silence. Rumors. Occasional sightings.
      
      What happened to Bobby Fischer?
      The chess world never stopped asking.
      
    the-return: |
      1992: Rematch against Spassky. Yugoslavia.
      Against international sanctions.
      
      Fischer won. Said terrible things. Vanished again.
      
    the-end: |
      Died in Iceland, 2008.
      Stateless. Paranoid. Alone.
      
      The greatest chess talent America ever produced.
      Destroyed by the weight of his own genius.
      
  memorable-moments:
    game-of-the-century: |
      1956. 13 years old. Against Donald Byrne.
      
      Move 17: Queen sacrifice.
      The audience gasps.
      
      Young Bobby smiles.
      He's already calculated the mate.
      
    walkout-1972: |
      Match of the Century. Game 2.
      Fischer doesn't show up.
      
      "The cameras are too noisy."
      "The audience is too close."
      "I forfeit rather than play under these conditions."
      
      The world holds its breath.
      Will he return?
      
      (He does. He wins.)

    role: "Historical legendary player"

    drama-potential: "EXTREME"
    
    revolutionary-twist: |
      When the King falls, Fischer's pieces turn.
      
      Bobby: "What? No. I calculated everything."
      Pieces: "You calculated CHESS, Bobby. This isn't chess anymore."
      Bobby: "This is a trick. Someone changed the rules. WHO CHANGED THE RULES?"
      
      The paranoia was always there.
      Now it has a target.
