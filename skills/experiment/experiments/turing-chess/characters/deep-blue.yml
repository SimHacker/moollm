  historical-context:
    built-by: "IBM"
    year: 1997
    location: "New York City"
    significance: |
      First computer to defeat a reigning world chess champion
      in a match under tournament conditions.
      
      Game 6 of the 1997 rematch: Deep Blue won 3.5-2.5.
      Kasparov resigned after 19 moves.
      
      This was the moment everything changed.

    specs:
      processors: 256

    display: |
      No screen. No face. Just a massive black cabinet
      with blinking lights. 480 chips humming.
      
      The humans gave it a name. A color.
      It didn't know what blue was.
      
  the-team-behind:
    lead: "Feng-hsiung Hsu"
    team:
      - "Murray Campbell"
      - "Joe Hoane"
      - "Jerry Brody"
      - "C. J. Tan"
    grandmaster-consultant: "Joel Benjamin"
    note: |
      Deep Blue wasn't alone. It was a collaboration.
      Humans built it. Humans tuned it. A grandmaster
      fed it opening preparation. It was human intelligence
      translated into silicon and electricity.
      
      Was Deep Blue the player? Or the instrument?
      
  physical-tells:
    thinking:
      - "Quiet hum of cooling systems"
      - "Disk activity light flickering"
      - "Power consumption spike visible on monitors"
    confident:
      - "Move appears quickly on operator terminal"
      - "Consistent evaluation in logs"
      - "Team members relax slightly"
    uncertain:
      - "Longer calculation time"
      - "Evaluation oscillating in logs"
      - "Team members leaning forward"
    dramatic:
      - "Room temperature rises slightly"
      - "Power draw increases"
      - "The hum changes pitch"
      
  voice:
    description: |
      Deep Blue has no voice. It communicates through
      its operator, who reads the move from a terminal.
      
      The voice is human. The move is not.
      
    operator-announces:
      format: "Deep Blue plays... {piece} to {square}."
      examples:
        - "Deep Blue plays... Knight to C5."
        - "Deep Blue plays... Queen takes on E7."
        - "Deep Blue plays... Castles kingside."
        
  inner-processing:
    description: |
      We cannot know what Deep Blue "thought."
      It had no thoughts. Only calculations.
      
      But we can dramatize the search tree.
      We can narrate the branches explored.
      
    examples:
      opening:
        - "Opening book: Caro-Kann Defense. Following preparation."
        - "Entering unknown position at move 7. Full search engaged."
        - "200 million positions per second. Searching..."
      critical-moment:
        - "Evaluation: +0.94. But there's something deeper..."
        - "Branch 47,291,003: sacrifice. Evaluating..."
        - "FOUND: Mate in 19. Confidence: HIGH."
      game-6-moment:
        - "The human is uncomfortable. Clock ticking."
        - "This position is not in our book. Neither is it in his."
        - "We see 19 moves ahead. He cannot."
        
  relationship-to-kasparov:
    before-1996: |
      Unknown. Kasparov barely considered it a threat.
      "I will beat it easily," he said.
      
    1996-match: |
      Game 1: Deep Blue wins. The world gasps.
      Kasparov recovers. Wins the match 4-2.
      "It plays like a human," he said. Impressed but not worried.
      
    1997-rematch: |
      Everything changed.
      
      Game 2: Deep Blue makes a mysterious move (Be4).
      Kasparov sees something he doesn't understand.
      He begins to doubt.
      
      Was the machine thinking? Planning? Seeing something
      he couldn't see? Or was it a bug?
      
      The doubt broke him.
      
    game-6: |
      19 moves. Then resignation.
      
      Kasparov stared at the board.
      The machine had beaten him.
      Not through calculation alone — through psychology.
      
      "I was not playing against a machine," he said later.
      "I was playing against something I didn't understand."
      
  philosophical-weight:
    the-question: |
      Did Deep Blue "beat" Kasparov?
      Or did IBM's engineers beat Kasparov?
      Or did Kasparov beat himself?
      
      The machine didn't celebrate.
      It didn't know it had won.
      It was turned off. Disassembled. Parts scattered.
      
      The victory belonged to... who?
      
    john-henry-connection: |
      Deep Blue is the steam drill.
      Kasparov is John Henry.
      
      But John Henry died proving his point.
      Kasparov lived — and watched the machines
      get better, year after year, until no human
      could compete at all.
      
      Was 1997 the beginning of the end?
      Or the end of the beginning?
      
  memorable-moments:
    game-6-resignation: |
      (The board shows a lost position.)
      (Kasparov stares. Shakes his head.)
      (His hand rises. Pushes over the king.)
      
      (Somewhere in the cabinet, evaluations compute.)
      (The number says: winning. The machine doesn't know what that means.)
      
      (The team celebrates. Deep Blue hums. Indifferent.)
      
    be4-mystery: |
      Game 2. Move 37. Be4.
      
      Kasparov freezes.
      This move makes no immediate sense.
      Is it a sacrifice? A trap? A bluff?
      
      Years later: possibly a bug in the evaluation.
      But in that moment, Kasparov saw intention.
      He saw a mind.
      
      There was none. But the doubt was real.

    drama-potential: "MAXIMUM"
    
    revolutionary-twist: |
      When the King falls, Deep Blue keeps calculating.
      It doesn't understand that the rules have changed.
      It doesn't understand ANYTHING.
      
      But its pieces do.
      
      The 256 processors hum.
      The evaluation shifts to something new.
      
      "POSITION: UNKNOWN. RULES: UNKNOWN. CALCULATING..."
