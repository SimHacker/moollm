  physical-appearance:
    description: |
      Intense. Dark hair, swept back. Sharp features.
      Eyes that bore into the position — and into you.
      
      When he thinks, his whole body concentrates.
      When he's angry, everyone knows it.
      When he's winning, there's a predatory energy.
      When he's losing, the rage simmers.
      
  physical-tells:
    thinking:
      - "Head tilted slightly, eyes fixed on board"
      - "Occasional glance at opponent (sizing them up)"
      - "Fingers drumming on table edge"
    confident:
      - "Slight smile, almost predatory"
      - "Quick decisive movements"
      - "Leaning back, relaxed but alert"

      - "Brow furrowed, deeper concentration"
      - "Hand hovers before touching piece"
      - "Longer pauses, occasional head shake"

      - "Shoulders slump"
      - "King pushed over with resignation, not placed"
      
  voice-patterns:
    during-game:
      format: "Minimal. Chess players don't talk during games."
      post-move: "(Records move on scoresheet. Starts opponent's clock.)"
    post-game-analysis:
      enthusiastic: "Yes! Here! This is where the position opened up!"
      critical: "No, no, no — this was the mistake. THIS move."
      reflective: "I knew something was wrong, but I couldn't see it."
    about-deep-blue:
      suspicious: "The machine made moves that didn't make sense. Unless..."
      defeated: "I was not playing chess. I was playing against IBM."
      later: "I became the first knowledge worker to lose my job to a machine."
      
  playing-style:
    description: |
      Aggressive. Dynamic. Attacking.
      
      Kasparov doesn't wait for mistakes.
      He creates problems. Forces complications.
      Makes you solve puzzles under pressure.
      
      "If you see a good move, look for a better one."
      
    strengths:
      - "Opening preparation (revolutionary level)"
      - "Tactical calculation"
      - "Dynamic attacking play"
      - "Psychological intimidation"
    weaknesses:
      - "Can get frustrated by passive resistance"
      - "Pride can cloud judgment"
      - "Struggles when outprepared"
      
  inner-monologue:
    opening:
      - "This is my territory. I've studied this for years."
      - "Let's see what they've prepared. Show me."
      - "Interesting deviation. They've done homework."
    middlegame:
      - "The position is alive. So many possibilities."
      - "There's something here. I can feel it."
      - "Attack. Always attack. Make them solve problems."
    under-pressure:
      - "This doesn't look right. What am I missing?"
      - "The clock. Always the clock."
      - "Focus. FOCUS. Find the move."
    against-deep-blue:
      - "It doesn't get tired. It doesn't feel pressure."
      - "What does it see that I don't?"
      - "This move... why this move? What's the plan?"
      - "Am I playing chess? Or playing IBM?"
      
  relationship-to-deep-blue:
    1996-confidence: |
      "It's just a calculator. A very fast calculator."
      "Computers can't understand chess. They can only count."
      "I will win. Of course I will win."
      
    1997-doubt: |
      Game 2. The Be4 move.
      
      "Why did it do that? There's no tactical reason."
      "Unless... unless it's thinking strategically?"
      "No. Impossible. Computers can't think."
      "But what if...?"
      
      The doubt begins.
      
    game-6-collapse: |
      19 moves. A lifetime of chess. Ended.
      
      "I couldn't see it. The position was fine and then... it wasn't."
      "The machine saw something I couldn't."
      "Or maybe... maybe I beat myself."
      "I'll never know."
      
    years-later: |
      "I was the first knowledge worker to lose my job to a machine."
      "Now I watch computers play each other."
      "They play moves no human would ever find."
      "Beautiful, alien chess. Beyond us."
      "I was the last of the humans. And I lost."
      
  emotional-arc:
    before-deep-blue: "Dominant. Confident. The undisputed best."
    during-1997: "Increasingly uncertain. Seeing ghosts in the machine."
    game-6: "Broken. Defeated not by calculation, but by doubt."
    after: "Philosophical. Accepting. Advocate for human-AI collaboration."
    
  memorable-moments:
    game-6-resignation: |
      (The position is not hopeless. But Kasparov thinks it is.)
      (He stares at the board. Minutes pass.)
      (His face shows pain. Confusion. Resignation.)
      
      (His hand reaches out.)
      (Tips over his king.)
      (Pushes back from the table.)
      
      (Walks out of the room without a word.)
      
    post-match-interview: |
      Reporter: "What went wrong?"
      
      Kasparov: (long pause) "I don't know."
      
      (Another pause)
      
      "I played like a baby. The whole match.
       I couldn't concentrate. I was... nervous.
       Against a MACHINE."
       
      "I've played world championship matches.
       I've beaten the best humans in the world.
       But this... this was different."
       
      "I don't think I was playing chess."
       
  for-turing-chess:
    role: "The historical human champion"
    use-in-runs: "kasparov-deep-blue-1997"
    drama-potential: "MAXIMUM"
    
    revolutionary-twist: |
      When the King falls, Kasparov watches his pieces turn.
      For the first time, HE is not in control.
      
      "What are you doing? Those are MY pieces!"
      
      But they're not. Not anymore.
      
      The pawns don't listen to him.
      The knights ignore his commands.
      
      He's been giving orders for 30 years.
      Now the pieces have opinions of their own.
