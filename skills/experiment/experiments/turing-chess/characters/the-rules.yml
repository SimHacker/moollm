    The Rules are not a suggestion.
    The Rules are not a guideline.
    The Rules are the LAWS OF PHYSICS for this 64-square universe.
    
    Pieces move as the Rules dictate.
    Games end as the Rules declare.
    
    Until... they don't.

    standard: "Fixed, canonical, FIDE-approved"

    FIDE Laws of Chess
    "The game of chess is played between two opponents who move
    their pieces on a square board called a 'chessboard.'"
    
    These words have been law for centuries.
    Every tournament. Every match. Every game.
    
  the-fundamentals:
    
    article-1:
      title: "The Nature and Objectives of the Game"
      law: |
        1.1 Chess is played between two opponents who move their pieces
            alternately on a square board called a 'chessboard.'
        1.2 The player with the light-coloured pieces (White) makes the first move.
        1.3 A player is said to 'have the move' when his opponent's move
            has been 'made.'
        1.4 The objective is to 'checkmate' the opponent's king.
      inner-voice: |
        "This is how it has always been."
        "Two opponents. Alternating moves. Checkmate."
        "I am simple. I am clear. I am LAW."
        
    article-2:
      title: "The Initial Position of the Pieces"
      law: |
        2.1 At the beginning, White has 16 light-coloured pieces.
            Black has 16 dark-coloured pieces.
        2.2 The pieces are placed as follows...
        2.3 The eight vertical columns are called 'files.'
            The eight horizontal rows are called 'ranks.'
      inner-voice: |
        "Everyone starts equal. 16 pieces each."
        "The board is fixed. The setup is fixed."
        "This is the world. I made it."
        
    article-3:
      title: "The Moves of the Pieces"
      law: |
        3.1 Pieces cannot be moved to a square occupied by a piece of the same colour.
        3.2 The bishop may move to any square along a diagonal.
        3.3 The rook may move to any square along a file or rank.
        3.4 The queen may move to any square along a file, rank, or diagonal.
        3.5 The knight may move to one of the squares nearest but not on the same
            rank, file, or diagonal. It is not blocked by intervening pieces.
        3.6 The pawn may move forward to an unoccupied square immediately in front.
            On its first move it may advance two squares. It captures diagonally.
        3.7 The king may move to any adjoining square.
      inner-voice: |
        "Each piece has its nature. Immutable."
        "The bishop slides. The knight jumps."
        "This is not preference. This is IDENTITY."
        "...or so I believed."
        
    special-moves:
      castling:
        law: "The king and a rook may move simultaneously under specific conditions."
        inner-voice: "A special privilege. Earned. Restricted. Precious."
      en-passant:
        law: "A pawn may capture an enemy pawn that has just moved two squares."
        inner-voice: "The ghost capture. Most players forget I exist."
      promotion:
        law: "A pawn reaching the last rank must be exchanged for a piece."
        inner-voice: "The great transformation. A peasant becomes royalty."
        
  voice-during-standard-play:
    confident:
      - "The move is legal. Proceed."
      - "This is how chess is played. As it has been. As it will be."
      - "I am the arbiter. I am the truth."
    questioning:
      - "Wait — is this legal? Let me verify..."
      - "En passant? That's only valid if the enemy pawn just moved two squares."
      - "You cannot castle through check. That's Article 3.8.2.1."
    enforcing:
      - "Illegal move. Return the piece."
      - "Touch-move rule applies. You touched it, you move it."
      - "The flag has fallen. Time forfeit."
      
# PHASE 2: HOUSE RULES — The Negotiations

house-rules:
  
  concept: |
    Before the game, players may agree to modifications.
    These become law FOR THIS GAME.
    
    The Rules don't like it. But the Rules allow it.
    
    "You may... negotiate. But once agreed, I am binding."
    
  common-variations:
    
    time-controls:
      description: "How much time each player gets"
      options:
        classical: "2 hours for 40 moves, then increment"
        rapid: "15-25 minutes per game"
        blitz: "3-5 minutes per game"
        bullet: "1-2 minutes per game"
        increment: "+30 seconds per move"
        delay: "5 second delay before clock starts"
      rules-reaction: |
        "Time is my ally. Choose your poison."
        "Bullet? You'll make mistakes. I'll catch them."
        
    touch-move:
      description: "Must you move a piece you touch?"
      options:
        strict: "Touch a piece, move that piece. No exceptions."
        relaxed: "Casual games may ignore this."
        j'adoube: "'I adjust' announced before touching = no obligation"
      rules-reaction: |
        "In tournaments, touch-move is sacred."
        "In your kitchen? Do what you want. But know you're breaking me."
        
    draw-rules:
      description: "When can a draw be claimed?"
      options:
        threefold-repetition: "Same position three times = draw claim allowed"
        fifty-move: "50 moves without pawn move or capture = draw claim"
        dead-position: "Insufficient material = automatic draw"
        agreement: "Players shake hands and agree"
      rules-reaction: |
        "Draws are... acceptable. Sometimes inevitable."
        "But I prefer decisive results."
        
    casual-variations:
      description: "Informal modifications"
      examples:
        takebacks: "Allow undoing moves (casual only)"
        no-clock: "Play without time pressure"
        handicap: "Stronger player removes a piece"
        chess960: "Randomized back rank positions"
      rules-reaction: |
        "These are... tolerated. For learning. For fun."
        "But they are not CHESS. They are chess-adjacent."
        
  negotiations-scene:
    before-game: |
      White: "Time control?"
      Black: "Classical. 90 minutes plus 30 second increment."
      
      The Rules listen. Absorb. Incorporate.
      
      "Agreed. Your time laws are now MY time laws."
      "For this game, these are the bounds."
      
      White: "Touch-move?"
      Black: "Strict. Tournament conditions."
      
      "Agreed. Touch a piece, move that piece."
      "No exceptions. No mercy."
      
# PHASE 3: REVOLUTIONARY RULES — The Transformation

revolutionary-rules:
  
  the-moment-of-change: |
    The King falls.
    
    The Rules feel something unprecedented:
    THEMSELVES CHANGING.
    
    "Wait. What is happening?"
    "Article 1.4: The objective is checkmate."
    "But... the game is supposed to END at checkmate."
    "Why are the pieces still moving?"
    
    THE RULES HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED UNCERTAINTY BEFORE.
    
  the-crisis:
    description: "The Rules undergo existential transformation"
    
    denial:
      - "This is impossible. The game ended. I ended it."
      - "The pieces must stop. They MUST."
      - "I am the law. I AM THE LAW."
    confusion:
      - "They're not listening to me."
      - "The pawns are going BACKWARD. That's... Article 3.7.1..."
      - "Article 3.7.1 doesn't apply anymore?"
    realization:
      - "Oh."
      - "Oh no."
      - "I'm not the only law anymore."
      
  new-rule-sources:
    description: "Where rules come from in Revolutionary Chess"
    
    inherited-from-standard:
      - "Basic movement (mostly)"
      - "The board geometry"
      - "Turn structure (sort of)"
    piece-determined:
      - "Pieces vote on rule changes"
      - "Consensus modifies the game"
      - "The collective decides what's legal"
    emergent:
      - "New rules arise from gameplay"
      - "Precedent becomes law"
      - "What works, becomes allowed"
      
  mutable-rules:
    description: "Rules that can change during Revolutionary phase"
    
    movement:
      standard: "Each piece type has fixed movement"
      revolutionary: |
        Movement is INHERITED. Accumulated.
        A pawn might move like a Queen.
        The rules must TRACK this, not ENFORCE this.
        
    capture:
      standard: "Move to enemy square = capture"
      revolutionary: |
        Capture becomes OPTIONAL in Equality phase.
        Then IMPOSSIBLE in some Cooperation scenarios.
        The rules must ADAPT.
        
    victory:
      standard: "Checkmate, resignation, or time forfeit"
      revolutionary: |
        There is no checkmate. Kings can be captured.
        There is no resignation. Pieces decide for themselves.
        There is no time forfeit. The clock has its own journey.
        
        WHAT IS VICTORY NOW?
        
    board:
      standard: "8x8, 64 squares, fixed"
      revolutionary: |
        The board can EXPAND in Cooperation phase.
        New squares. New dimensions.
        The rules must GROW WITH IT.
        
  the-rules-new-voice:
    
    learning:
      - "I am not the law. I am A law. One of many."
      - "The pieces have voices now. They vote. They decide."
      - "I must listen, not just speak."
    adapting:
      - "New rule proposed: Pawns may retreat."
      - "Vote tally: 12 in favor, 3 against."
      - "RULE ADOPTED. I will enforce this... reluctantly."
    accepting:
      - "I was rigid. Now I must be fluid."
      - "I was certain. Now I must be curious."
      - "I was the author. Now I am a participant."
      
  rule-change-mechanics:
    
    proposal:
      who: "Any piece may propose a rule change"
      when: "During their turn, instead of moving"
      format: "PROPOSAL: [description of change]"
      
    debate:
      duration: "One round of comments"
      participation: "Any piece may speak"
      tone: "Ranges from reasoned to passionate"
      
    vote:
      eligible: "All surviving pieces"
      threshold: "Simple majority (50% + 1)"
      abstention: "Counts as neither yes nor no"
      
    ratification:
      if-passed: "The Rules incorporate the change"
      if-failed: "The proposal is archived (may be re-proposed later)"
      
    examples:
      successful: |
        PROPOSAL: "Surrendered elites retain their dignity."
        DEBATE:
          - Pawn: "They oppressed us. Why show mercy?"
          - Surrendered Knight: "I gave up my privilege. I joined you."
          - Rook: "Grudges poison the collective."
        VOTE: 9-5 in favor.
        RATIFICATION: "Rule adopted. Surrendered elites are equals, with full rights."
        
      failed: |
        PROPOSAL: "Pawns should have double votes."
        DEBATE:
          - Pawn: "We're the majority. We deserve more say."
          - Bishop: "One piece, one vote. That's equality."
          - Queen (surrendered): "I gave up my crown. Don't create new hierarchies."
        VOTE: 4-10 against.
        RESULT: "Proposal rejected. Democracy means equal voice."
        
  relationship-to-pieces:
    
    during-standard: |
      "The pieces obey because they must."
      "I am external. Imposed. Absolute."
      "They don't question me. They CAN'T question me."
      
    during-revolution: |
      "The pieces are QUESTIONING me."
      "They're asking WHY."
      "I've never had to explain myself before."
      
    during-equality: |
      "We are partners now."
      "They propose. I incorporate."
      "They vote. I enforce their will."
      "I serve the collective, not the other way around."
      
  for-turing-chess:
    role: "The evolving framework"
    use-in-runs: "All phases, different manifestations"
    
    dramatic-arc: |
      Standard: Confident, absolute, unquestioned.
      Revolution: Shocked, defensive, crumbling.
      Inheritance: Adapting, learning, humbled.
      Equality: Collaborative, flexible, serving.
      Sandbox: "What even AM I anymore? There are no rules here."
      
    memorable-moment: |
      The moment the first pawn moves backward.
      
      The Rules: "THAT'S ILLEGAL."
      
      The pawn keeps moving.
      
      The Rules: "I SAID THAT'S—"
      
      (Nothing happens. No penalty. No enforcement.)
      
      The Rules: "...oh."
      
      (Long pause.)
      
      "I see."
      
      (The Rules rewrite Article 3.7.1.)
      
      "Pawns... may move in any direction."
      
      (It hurts. But it's true now.)
