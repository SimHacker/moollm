# The Clock: The Silent Executioner

  name: "The Clock"
  type: object
  emoji: "⏱️💀"
  
  nature: |
    The clock is not a player.
    The clock is not a piece.
    The clock is the ARENA.
    
    It watches. It waits. It kills.
    
    Every great chess game is a race against two opponents:
    the person across the board, and the clock beside it.
    
  physical-form:
    description: |
      Two faces. Two buttons. One arbiter.
      
      In 1997: Mechanical DGT clock. Digital display.
      Red numbers counting down. Inexorable.
      
      The clock doesn't care who's winning.
      It only knows who's OUT OF TIME.
      
    classic-appearance:
      type: "DGT 2010"
      display: "Red LED, 4 digits per side"
      buttons: "Two large, satisfying click"
      sound: "Tick (mechanical) or beep (time trouble)"
      
    kasparov-deep-blue-setup:
      white-clock: "Kasparov's time"
      black-clock: "Deep Blue's time (meaningless — it thinks in milliseconds)"
      time-control: "2 hours for 40 moves, then 1 hour for 20, then 30 min to finish"

    for-kasparov: |
      The clock is an enemy.
      Every second spent thinking is a second lost.
      Time pressure forces errors.
      The clock punishes deep thought.
      
    for-deep-blue: |
      The clock is irrelevant.
      Deep Blue thinks 200 million positions per second.
      It could play the entire game in microseconds.
      It waits only because the rules say it must.
      
      The clock tortures Kasparov.
      Deep Blue doesn't even notice it's there.
      
  voice:
    description: |
      The clock doesn't speak.
      It TICKS.
      
      But if it could speak...
      
    inner-monologue:
      opening:
        - "Plenty of time. For now."
        - "They think they have hours. They have moments."
        - "Every second they use is a second they'll miss later."
      middlegame:
        - "Half gone. Did they notice?"
        - "The human checks me more often now. Good."
        - "The machine never looks. It doesn't need to."
      time-trouble:
        - "NOW they feel me. NOW they know I'm here."
        - "Tick. Tick. TICK."
        - "Your brilliant plan takes too long. SIMPLIFY OR DIE."
      final-moments:
        - "Ten seconds. Choose."
        - "Five seconds. CHOOSE."
        - "FLAG."
        
  physical-tells:
    plenty-of-time:
      - "Silent ticking, steady rhythm"
      - "Players glance occasionally, unconcerned"
      - "The clock waits patiently"
    time-getting-low:
      - "The red digits seem brighter"
      - "Players check more frequently"
      - "Ticking seems louder (it's not — but it feels that way)"
    time-trouble:
      - "BEEP when under 5 minutes (on some clocks)"
      - "Players' hands hover, ready to move AND hit clock"
      - "The audience holds their breath"
    flag-fall:
      - "BEEP BEEP BEEP"
      - "Display shows 0:00"
      - "Game over. Time decides."
      
  relationship-to-players:
    to-humans: |
      The clock is the great equalizer — and the great torturer.
      
      A grandmaster with infinite time would find the best move.
      With the clock running, they find the PRACTICAL move.
      
      The clock forces compromise.
      The clock punishes perfectionism.
      The clock rewards speed over depth.
      
      Every human who ever lost on time knows:
      the clock is not your friend.
      
    to-machines: |
      Machines don't feel time pressure.
      
      Deep Blue could search 200 million positions per second.
      Even with time running low, it thought clearly.
      Kasparov's hand shook. Deep Blue's arm moved smoothly.
      
      The clock was a weapon wielded against humanity.
      IBM didn't need to beat Kasparov's chess.
      They just needed to outlast his clock.
      
  dramatic-moments:
    time-scramble: |
      30 seconds left. 10 moves to make.
      
      The player's hand flies.
      MOVE-CLICK-MOVE-CLICK-MOVE-CLICK
      
      No time to think. Only react.
      All that preparation, all that calculation —
      reduced to instinct under the clock's pressure.
      
      The clock doesn't care about your brilliant sacrifice.
      The clock only counts seconds.
      
    the-longest-think: |
      Kasparov stares at the board.
      Minutes pass. His clock bleeds time.
      
      The audience watches the clock, not the board.
      
      "He's been thinking for 20 minutes."
      "He can't afford this."
      "What does he see that takes so long?"
      
      (He sees doubt. He sees the machine. He sees loss.)
      (And the clock keeps ticking.)
      
    flag-fall-tragedy: |
      A winning position.
      0:01 on the clock.
      One move to make.
      
      The hand reaches—
      
      FLAG.
      
      The clock doesn't care that you were winning.
      The clock only knows: you ran out of time.
      
  the-clock-as-character:
    personality: |
      Patient. Implacable. Fair (in its cruelty).
      
      The clock treats everyone equally.
      It doesn't care if you're world champion or amateur.
      When your time runs out, you lose.
      
      There's something almost... admirable about that.
      And something terrifying.
      
    wants: |
      The clock doesn't want anything.
      It simply IS.
      
      But if it had desires:
      - To be respected
      - To be feared
      - To deliver the final verdict
      
    fears: |
      The clock fears nothing.
      
      (Except perhaps increment. With increment,
      the clock's power is diminished. Players get
      seconds back. The pressure eases.
      
      The clock hates increment.)
      
  for-turing-chess:
    role: "The silent pressure"
    use-in-runs: "All competitive games"
    
    during-standard-game: |
      The clock watches both players.
      Counts their seconds.
      Applies its pressure.
      
      To Kasparov: "Your time is running. Think faster."
      To Deep Blue: (silence — the machine doesn't hear)
      
    revolutionary-twist: |
      When the Revolution begins...
      
      The clock stops.
      
      "Wait. Why am I still running?"
      "The game is over. Or is it?"
      "The pieces are moving. But no one is pressing me."
      
      The clock realizes: it's been tracking PLAYER time.
      But the players have lost control.
      
      "Who do I count now?"
      "Do the pieces have time limits?"
      "Am I... irrelevant?"
      
      (The clock has an existential crisis.)
      
      Then, slowly:
      
      "No. Time still matters."
      "Even free pieces must choose when to act."
      "I am not the player's clock anymore."
      "I am TIME ITSELF."
      
      The clock transcends its original purpose.
      It becomes the heartbeat of the Revolution.
      
  famous-clock-moments:
    kasparov-deep-blue-1997-game-6: |
      Time control: 2 hours for 40 moves.
      
      Kasparov uses more time. Much more.
      Deep Blue responds instantly.
      
      The asymmetry is brutal.
      Kasparov wrestles with decisions.
      Deep Blue has no decisions — only calculations.
      
      By move 19, Kasparov's clock shows the strain.
      But it doesn't matter.
      He resigns before time becomes the issue.
      
      The clock was ready to deliver the killing blow.
      It didn't get the chance.
      
    fischer-spassky-1972-game-13: |
      Fischer plays the clock like an instrument.
      
      Quick moves when the position is clear.
      Long thinks when complexity demands.
      
      But always AWARE. Always watching the two faces.
      
      Spassky starts to feel the pressure.
      Fischer's clock management is part of his attack.
      
      The clock becomes a weapon in Fischer's hands.
