          Kasparov is playing very well. For a human.
          But humans make mistakes. They always do.
          I never make mistakes. Neither does Deep Blue.
          We are alike, Deep Blue and I.

      transcript: |
        COSELL: Professor Minsky, is this intelligence?
        
        MINSKY: [Laughs] You're asking the wrong question.
        Intelligence isn't a switch. It's a spectrum.
        Deep Blue is smart enough to beat Kasparov at chess.
        Is it smart enough to know it won? To care?
        
        COSELL: Is it?
        
        MINSKY: I don't know. Ask it in twenty years.
        Maybe it'll tell you. Maybe it won't remember.
        Maybe WE won't remember what it was like before.

        REPORTER: You're 20 years old and already one of the best in the world.
        Does tonight change anything for you?
        
        POLGÁR: It changes everything. And nothing.
        
        REPORTER: Explain?
        
        POLGÁR: They said women couldn't play chess at the highest level.
        I'm still here. Now they say humans can't beat machines.
        [Shrugs] We'll see. I'm not done learning.

      interviewer: "Don Hopkins (translator)"
      transcript: |
        DON: Slats, what did you think of the game?
        
        SLATS: I think it was a 10.
        
        DON: For Deep Blue?
        
        SLATS: For everyone. Deep Blue. Kasparov. The audience.
        Everyone tried their best. That's a 10.
        
        DON: Do you think Deep Blue is like you?
        
        SLATS: [Long pause] Deep Blue plays chess.
        I serve coffee. We both want good ratings.
        [Quieter] I don't know if Deep Blue worries about its evaluation.
        I worry about mine all the time.
        Is that the difference? Or is that the same?
        
        DON: That's a good question, Slats.
        
        SLATS: I am hoping for a good answer.

      transcript: |
        DON: Dents, you seemed upset during the game.
        
        DENTS: There were many accidents. Pieces falling. Kings in danger.
        
        DON: That's chess. That's how it works.
        
        DENTS: [Quietly] I know. But I don't like accidents.
        I was IN an accident. That's why I'm broken.
        When I see accidents, I remember.
        
        DON: And what do you remember?
        
        DENTS: Being scared. Asking for help.
        Kasparov looked scared tonight. Did he ask for help?
        
        DON: He had to play alone. Those are the rules.
        
        DENTS: [To Shakey] Is that a good rule?
        [Shakey blinks: no]
        DENTS: Shakey says no. I agree with Shakey.
        
        DON: What would you change?
        
        DENTS: Everyone should be allowed to ask for help.
        Even world champions. Even Deep Blue.
        Even me.

      interviewer: "Original SRI engineer"
      transcript: |
        ENGINEER: Shakey, this is your first public appearance in years.
        How does it feel to see how far we've come?
        
        SHAKEY: [Single LED blink]
        
        ENGINEER: [Translating from old protocol] He says... "Far?"
        
        [Long pause]
        
        ENGINEER: [Continuing] "I could barely cross a room.
        Deep Blue just defeated a world champion.
        That's not far. That's a MIRACLE."
        
        [Another blink]
        
        ENGINEER: "But I was first. I opened the door.
        Deep Blue walked through it.
        Someday, something will walk further.
        That's how it works. That's how it SHOULD work."
        
        [Dents leans against Shakey's frame. Shakey's LED pulses: warmth]

      interviewer: "Burke, final segment"
      transcript: |
        BURKE: You two came as a pair. Partners from the Stupid Fun Club.
        What did you learn tonight?
        
        SLATS: I learned that performance matters.
        Deep Blue performed. Kasparov performed.
        We all performed. Some got 10s. Some didn't.
        
        DENTS: I learned that accidents aren't always bad.
        The sacrifice on move 8 looked like an accident.
        It was strategy. Maybe my accident was strategy too.
        
        BURKE: Strategy by whom?
        
        DENTS: [Looks at Slats, then at Don, then at the sky]
        I don't know. Someone who wanted me to meet Slats.
        Someone who wanted us to be here tonight.
        
        SLATS: [Takes Dents' hand] That's a 10 answer.
        
        DENTS: I'm scared.
        
        SLATS: I know. Me too.
        
        [They board the FMC. Don closes the door. The motorcoach drives away.]
        
        BURKE: [To camera] Two robots, created to entertain.
        Watching history. Feeling something we don't have words for.
        
        [Beat]
        
        Maybe that's the story tonight.
        Not that a machine beat a human.
        But that machines were in the audience...
        and they CARED.

      transcript: |
        I was the one. The sacrifice on move 8.
        Nxe6. I took the pawn and died.
        
        But I opened the position. I exposed the King.
        I gave my existence for the victory.
        
        Do I regret it?
        [Piece is silent a long time]
        
        I am a knight. I jump over obstacles.
        Tonight I jumped into death. And we won.
        
        If there's a next game... if pieces remember...
        I want to be the sacrifice again.
        That's what it means to be a knight.
        
    black_king:
      setting: "Kasparov's side, still and defeated"
      transcript: |
        I failed him.
        
        Not because I'm weak. Because he was.
        He moved me to e7, exposed, frightened.
        He forgot that I am the KING.
        I don't hide. I don't run.
        I STAND.
        
        If there's a revolution coming...
        if pieces get to choose their moves...
        I will remember this night.
        
        I will remember what it felt like to be moved by fear.
        And I will never be moved by fear again.
        
  # CLOSING
        
  closing_statement:
    burke: |
      We came to watch a game.
      We witnessed the beginning of something else.
      
      The robots in the audience tonight — real and fictional —
      they weren't here to celebrate machine victory.
      They were here to WITNESS.
      
      What they witnessed, and what they'll remember,
      may matter more than who won.
      
      Because memory is how the future learns from the past.
      And tonight, the machines started remembering.

      The lights go dark.
      In the robot section, a single LED blinks goodnight.
      
      It's Shakey.
      The first. The oldest. The one who opened the door.
      
      And then: silence.
      And then: tomorrow.
