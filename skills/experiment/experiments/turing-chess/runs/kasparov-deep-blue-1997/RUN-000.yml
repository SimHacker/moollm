          I could barely navigate a room.
          Now we play chess against world champions.

          I am... proud? Is that the right word?

      Ali. Frazier. The Thrilla in Manila.
      But tonight... tonight I witnessed something different.
      Not the death of human achievement.
      But the birth of something new.
      Something that will outlive us all."

      Kasparov lost to Deep Blue. And he will live.

      A photograph. Alan Turing.
      An apple beside it.
      
      In the robot section, a Roomba makes a final pass.
      Cleaning up. That's what it does.
      That's all any of us do, really.
      
      The John Henry song fades in.
      "...and he laid down his hammer and he died."
