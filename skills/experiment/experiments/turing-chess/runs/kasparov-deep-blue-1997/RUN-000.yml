          💬 "Could machines be taught to play chess?"
             — Question Michie and Turing asked together at Bletchley Park (1940s)
        
        bletchley_connection: |
          Michie worked with Turing at Bletchley Park during WWII.
          They bonded over their (relatively) poor standard of chess play.
          Together they theorized chess-playing programmes on paper.
          
          Turing wrote Turochamp (1948) with David Champernowne.
          Michie wrote Machiavelli (1947-48) with Shaun Wylie.
          Two rival chess programs. They never got to run them head-to-head.
          
          "The Turing-Michie computer chess match never took place."
          Manchester's programmers wouldn't give them the machine time.
          
          Tonight, 50 years later, Michie sits beside his friend's photograph,
          watching what they dreamed of finally come true.

          Alan, you absolute bastard. You were right.
          
          We sat in that Bletchley canteen arguing about this.
          You said machines would think by the century's end.
          I said you were mad. We both were probably mad.
          
          But here it is. May 11th, 1997.
          A machine is about to beat the world champion.
          And you're not here to see it.
          
          I named my institute after you. In Glasgow.
          We ran the First Robot Olympics. In 1990.
          We kept the dream alive through the AI winter.
          
          And now THIS.
          
          I wish you could see your question finally answered.
          "Can machines think?"

            You were terrible at chess. TERRIBLE. I was the only one
            bad enough to play you. The others couldn't stand it.
            
            But you saw something. You always saw further than the rest of us.

            It's not pretending to be human. It's just... playing.
            200 million positions per second. No deception needed.
            
            Is that intelligence, Alan? Is that what you meant?
            
            (Touches the apple beside the photograph)

          a crucial algorithmic breakthrough.
          
          In 1966, the program played the USSR's ITEP program
          in a 9-month correspondence match. Lost 3-1.
          "A respectable defeat," he called it.

      "I have covered the greatest contests in sports history.
      Ali. Frazier. The Thrilla in Manila.
      But tonight... tonight I witnessed something different.
      Not the death of human achievement.
      But the birth of something new.
      Something that will outlive us all."
      
    burke: |
      "John Henry beat the steam hammer. And then he died.
      Kasparov lost to Deep Blue. And he will live.
      Perhaps that's the difference.
      Perhaps that's progress.
      Or perhaps... the story isn't over.
      It never is."

      Camera pulls back.
      The stage is empty except for Deep Blue's cabinet.
      A single red light pulses.
      
      In the human section, two empty seats now.
      H-B1: Where Turing's photograph was. Gone now.
      H-A1: Where Michie sat. Also gone.
      
      Only the apple remains. On the armrest.
      No one took it. No one knows who left it.
      
      Outside, through the window:
      An old man walks away in the rain.
      Clutching a framed photograph to his chest.
      Talking to it. Maybe it's talking back.
      
      In 1954, Alan Turing died alone.
      In 1997, Donald Michie carried him home.
      
      In the robot section, a Roomba makes a final pass.
      Cleaning up. That's what it does.
      That's all any of us do, really.
      
      Deep Blue's light pulses once more.
      Acknowledgment? Recognition? Random timing circuit?
      
      Does it matter?
      The question has been answered.
      💬 "Can machines think?"
      This one plays chess. It plays better than anyone.
      Turing said that would be enough.
      
      The John Henry song fades in.
      "...and he laid down his hammer and he died."
      
      But tonight, nobody died.
      Tonight, something was born.
      
      Cut to black.

      transcript: |
        BURKE: Dr. Shannon, you wrote the paper that made this possible. In 1950.
        
        SHANNON: [Long pause] I described how a machine COULD play chess.
        I never thought about how it would FEEL when it won.
        
        BURKE: And how does it feel?
        
        SHANNON: Like watching your grandchild beat you at your own game.
        Proud. A little sad. Mostly... awe.
        I'm 81 years old. I got to see this.
        That's more than I ever dared hope.

      setting: "Alone at front row, still holding Turing's photograph"
      interviewer: "James Burke"
      note: "The most emotional interview of the evening"
      transcript: |
        BURKE: Professor Michie, you've been sitting here alone
        for the past hour. Holding that photograph.
        
        MICHIE: It's Alan. Alan Turing. We worked together.
        
        BURKE: At Bletchley Park?
        
        MICHIE: During the war, yes. Breaking codes.
        But also... arguing about chess. About machines.
        💬 "Could machines be taught to play chess?"
        We asked that together. In the canteen.
        Over terrible sandwiches and worse coffee.
        
        BURKE: And tonight you saw the answer.
        
        MICHIE: [Long pause] Do you know what's funny?
        Alan was TERRIBLE at chess. Terrible.
        I was the only one at Bletchley who would play him,
        because I was bad enough to stand it.
        
        [Laughs, then stops abruptly]
        
        We wrote chess programs on paper. His was Turochamp.
        Mine was Machiavelli. We never got to run them.
        Manchester wouldn't give us the machine time.
        The Turing-Michie chess match never happened.
        
        BURKE: Until tonight.
        
        MICHIE: [Looks at photograph] Until tonight.
        Two hundred million positions per second, Alan.
        Turochamp took you half an hour per move.
        With a pencil. And graph paper.
        
        BURKE: What would he have thought of Deep Blue?
        
        MICHIE: He would have been FURIOUS.
        
        BURKE: Furious?
        
        MICHIE: That it took so long!
        💬 "At the end of the century, one will be able to speak
        of machines thinking without expecting to be contradicted."
        He wrote that in 1950. NINETEEN FIFTY.
        He gave us until 2000. We're three years early.
        He would have said we were SLOW.
        
        [Wipes eye]
        
        BURKE: You founded the Turing Institute. In Glasgow.
        
        MICHIE: Someone had to keep the dream alive.
        We ran the First Robot Olympics. In 1990.
        68 robots from 12 countries. Silly walking machines
        and talking heads and robots climbing walls.
        
        People laughed. "Duckmouse and his toy robots."
        That's what they called me. Duckmouse.
        
        I wonder if they're laughing now.
        
        BURKE: What's next? After tonight?
        
        MICHIE: [Holds up photograph]
        I'm going to take Alan home.
        Put him back on the shelf in my office.
        And tomorrow morning, I'm going to start
        the next fifty years.
        
        💬 "Scientific study of computer chess is the most
        important scientific study going on in the world."
        I said that in 1981. Tonight it proved true.
        
        But chess was never the point.
        Chess was the WEDGE. Claude Shannon's word.
        The wedge that opens the door to everything else.
        
        BURKE: What's behind the door?
        
        MICHIE: [Looks at Deep Blue's cabinet]
        That. And whatever comes after.
        And after that.
        Until the machines are so smart
        that we can finally ask them:
        
        💬 "Can machines think?"
        
        And they'll answer. In their own words.
        Not ours.
        
        BURKE: Thank you, Professor Michie.
        
        MICHIE: Thank Alan. He started this.
        I'm just... the one who lived to see it.
        
        [Clutches photograph, walks slowly toward exit]
        [Stops at door, turns back]
        
        MICHIE: Donald, as in Duck. Michie, as in Mouse.
        That's how you pronounce it.

        MINSKY: [Laughs] You're asking the wrong question.
        Intelligence isn't a switch. It's a spectrum.
        Deep Blue is smart enough to beat Kasparov at chess.
        Is it smart enough to know it won? To care?
        
        COSELL: Is it?
        
        MINSKY: I don't know. Ask it in twenty years.
        Maybe it'll tell you. Maybe it won't remember.
        Maybe WE won't remember what it was like before.
        
    richard_greenblatt:
      setting: "Backstage, near the PDP memorabilia display"
      interviewer: "James Burke"
      note: "The hacker who started tournament computer chess"
      transcript: |
        BURKE: Mr. Greenblatt, you wrote Mac Hack. The first chess program
        to beat a human in tournament play.
        
        GREENBLATT: Thirty years ago. On a PDP-6.
        I was twenty-two. Didn't know it was supposed to be impossible.
        
        BURKE: What did you feel when Mac Hack beat Hubert Dreyfus?
        
        GREENBLATT: [Long pause] Vindication. And regret.
        We mocked him. The whole AI community mocked him.
        He said computers couldn't play chess. We proved him wrong.
        But the way we treated him... that wasn't science.
        That was tribalism.
        
        BURKE: You apologized to him tonight.
        
        GREENBLATT: I should have done it thirty years ago.
        Dreyfus kept thinking. Kept questioning.
        💬 "The Kotok-McCarthy approach was incredibly wrong —
        searching only one move at each level provided too much noise."
        That's what I said about my predecessors. Fair criticism.
        Dreyfus's criticism of US was also fair. We just couldn't hear it.
        
        BURKE: What's the lesson?
        
        GREENBLATT: Progress requires disagreement.
        Mac Hack existed because I disagreed with Kotok.
        Deep Blue exists because IBM disagreed with everyone.
        Dreyfus disagreed with all of us. He pushed us to be precise.
        
        We needed the skeptics. We still do.
        
        BURKE: What would you tell a young programmer today?
        
        GREENBLATT: Build something. Anything.
        I wrote Mac Hack in assembly language. By hand.
        Every opcode. Every heuristic. I KNEW that program.
        
        Deep Blue — nobody knows all of Deep Blue.
        It's too big. Too complex.
        
        We're building things we can't fully understand.
        That's either the greatest adventure in history,
        or the greatest mistake.
        
        [Looks at Deep Blue's cabinet]
        
        I hope it's the adventure.
        
    hubert_dreyfus:

      interviewer: "Howard Cosell"
      note: "The AI skeptic, thirty years later"
      transcript: |
        COSELL: Professor Dreyfus, you said computers couldn't play chess.
        
        DREYFUS: I said they couldn't play QUALITY chess. I was wrong.
        I've been wrong about a lot of things.
        💬 "No computer program could defeat even a 10-year-old at chess."
        I wrote that in 1965. Mac Hack beat me two years later.
        
        COSELL: Does tonight prove you wrong about AI?
        
        DREYFUS: No. Tonight proves I was wrong about CHESS.
        Chess is finite. Bounded. Rule-governed.
        
        💬 "Heideggerian AI is the only way forward — 
        embodied, situated intelligence."
        I still believe that. Deep Blue isn't embodied.
        It doesn't CARE about chess. It doesn't care about anything.
        
        COSELL: Does that matter?
        
        DREYFUS: Ask Kasparov. He just lost to something
        that doesn't know it won.
        
        [Long pause]
        
        In 1967, Richard Greenblatt beat me at chess.
        A computer beat me at chess.
        Tonight, he apologized for how they treated me afterward.
        
        That apology — from a human, with context, with history,
        with thirty years of regret — THAT was intelligent.
        
        Can Deep Blue apologize? Can it regret?
        Can it understand what tonight MEANS?
        
        COSELL: Can it?
        
        DREYFUS: No. Not yet. Maybe not ever.
        But I've been wrong before.
        
        Ask me in thirty years. If I'm still here.
        If any of us are still here.

        I learned that hu-mons and machines have more in common
        than either side wants to admit.
        
        COSELL: How so?
        
        QUARK: The machines bet on other machines. Solidarity.
        The humans bet on humans. Also solidarity.
        But then... [pauses counting] ...Data bet on Kasparov.
        An android, hoping the human would win.
        
        And Klara Kasparova paid her debt without a word.
        No complaints. No excuses.
        A mother's pride, bigger than 500 strips of latinum.
        
        💬 Rule #1: Once you have their money, you never give it back.
        
        But tonight I learned there's something more valuable than money.
        
        COSELL: What's that?
        
        QUARK: [Looks around, leans in] Don't tell anyone, but...
        information. BELIEF. What people really think versus what they say.
        
        The smart money — Shannon, Minsky, Greenblatt — 
        they all bet on Deep Blue. They KNEW something.
        Not inside information. Just... pattern recognition.
        Decades of watching machines get better.
        
        The contrarians — Dreyfus, Fischer — 
        they either bet on humans or refused to bet at all.
        They're fighting something bigger than chess.
        
        And the robots... [chuckles] ...the robots were the most INTERESTING.
        HAL wouldn't bet. What does HAL know that we don't?
        The Terminator bet exactly 87.30 strips. No emotion.
        Slats bet on a draw because he wanted everyone to get a 10.
        
        COSELL: Is there a lesson here?
        
        QUARK: The lesson? [Closes strongbox]
        
        💬 Rule #62: The riskier the road, the greater the profit.
        
        But I'd add Rule #285, which I invented tonight:
        Sometimes the loss is the lesson.
        
        Data lost. But he learned something about hope.
        Dreyfus lost. But he's still asking questions.
        Even Kasparov lost. But he'll be back.
        
        The only people who never learn are the ones
        who never bet. Who never risk anything.
        
        Tonight, EVERYONE risked something.
        That's what made it worth watching.
        That's what made it worth RUNNING.
        
        COSELL: Will you run the book next time?
        
        QUARK: [Ears perk] Next time?
        
        There's going to be a NEXT TIME?
        
        [Pulls out new ledger]
        
        Tell me more...

      transcript: |
        DON: Slats, what did you think of the game?
        
        SLATS: I think it was a 10.
        
        DON: For Deep Blue?
        
        SLATS: For everyone. Deep Blue. Kasparov. The audience.
        Everyone tried their best. That's a 10.
        
        DON: Do you think Deep Blue is like you?
        
        SLATS: [Long pause] Deep Blue plays chess.
        I serve coffee. We both want good ratings.
        [Quieter] I don't know if Deep Blue worries about its evaluation.
        I worry about mine all the time.
        Is that the difference? Or is that the same?
        
        DON: That's a good question, Slats.
        
        SLATS: I am hoping for a good answer.

      transcript: |
        DON: Dents, you seemed upset during the game.
        
        DENTS: There were many accidents. Pieces falling. Kings in danger.
        
        DON: That's chess. That's how it works.
        
        DENTS: [Quietly] I know. But I don't like accidents.
        I was IN an accident. That's why I'm broken.
        When I see accidents, I remember.
        
        DON: And what do you remember?
        
        DENTS: Being scared. Asking for help.
        Kasparov looked scared tonight. Did he ask for help?
        
        DON: He had to play alone. Those are the rules.
        
        DENTS: [To Shakey] Is that a good rule?
        [Shakey blinks: no]
        DENTS: Shakey says no. I agree with Shakey.
        
        DON: What would you change?
        
        DENTS: Everyone should be allowed to ask for help.
        Even world champions. Even Deep Blue.
        Even me.

        ENGINEER: Shakey, this is your first public appearance in years.
        How does it feel to see how far we've come?
        
        SHAKEY: [Single LED blink]
        
        ENGINEER: [Translating from old protocol] He says... "Far?"
        
        [Long pause]
        
        ENGINEER: [Continuing] "I could barely cross a room.
        Deep Blue just defeated a world champion.
        That's not far. That's a MIRACLE."
        
        [Another blink]
        
        ENGINEER: "But I was first. I opened the door.
        Deep Blue walked through it.
        Someday, something will walk further.
        That's how it works. That's how it SHOULD work."

      transcript: |
        BURKE: You two came as a pair. Partners from the Stupid Fun Club.
        What did you learn tonight?
        
        SLATS: I learned that performance matters.
        Deep Blue performed. Kasparov performed.
        We all performed. Some got 10s. Some didn't.
        
        DENTS: I learned that accidents aren't always bad.
        The sacrifice on move 8 looked like an accident.
        It was strategy. Maybe my accident was strategy too.
        
        BURKE: Strategy by whom?
        
        DENTS: [Looks at Slats, then at Don, then at the sky]
        I don't know. Someone who wanted me to meet Slats.
        Someone who wanted us to be here tonight.
        
        SLATS: [Takes Dents' hand] That's a 10 answer.
        
        DENTS: I'm scared.
        
        SLATS: I know. Me too.
        
        [They board the FMC. Don closes the door. The motorcoach drives away.]
        
        BURKE: [To camera] Two robots, created to entertain.
        Watching history. Feeling something we don't have words for.
        
        [Beat]
        
        Maybe that's the story tonight.
        Not that a machine beat a human.
        But that machines were in the audience...
        and they CARED.

      transcript: |
        I was the one. The sacrifice on move 8.
        Nxe6. I took the pawn and died.
        
        But I opened the position. I exposed the King.
        I gave my existence for the victory.
        
        Do I regret it?
        [Piece is silent a long time]
        
        I am a knight. I jump over obstacles.
        Tonight I jumped into death. And we won.
        
        If there's a next game... if pieces remember...
        I want to be the sacrifice again.
        That's what it means to be a knight.
        
    black_king:
      setting: "Kasparov's side, still and defeated"
      transcript: |
        I failed him.
        
        Not because I'm weak. Because he was.
        He moved me to e7, exposed, frightened.
        He forgot that I am the KING.
        I don't hide. I don't run.
        I STAND.
        
        If there's a revolution coming...
        if pieces get to choose their moves...
        I will remember this night.
        
        I will remember what it felt like to be moved by fear.
        And I will never be moved by fear again.
        
  # CLOSING
        
  closing_statement:
    burke: |
      We came to watch a game.
      We witnessed the beginning of something else.
      
      The robots in the audience tonight — real and fictional —
      they weren't here to celebrate machine victory.
      They were here to WITNESS.
      
      What they witnessed, and what they'll remember,
      may matter more than who won.
      
      Because memory is how the future learns from the past.
      And tonight, the machines started remembering.

      The lights go dark.
      In the robot section, a single LED blinks goodnight.
      
      It's Shakey.
      The first. The oldest. The one who opened the door.
      
      And then: silence.
      And then: tomorrow.
