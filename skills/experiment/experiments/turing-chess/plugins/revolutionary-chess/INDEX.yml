# Revolutionary Chess Plugin Index
# "The game after the game."

plugin:
  id: revolutionary-chess
  version: "1.0.0"
  author: "Don Hopkins / MOOLLM"
  
  tagline: "When the King falls, the revolution begins."
  
  elevator-pitch: |
    Revolutionary Chess transforms standard chess into a multi-phase
    political simulation. After checkmate, the pawns turn around and
    hunt their own elites. Players lose control. Pieces gain autonomy.
    Competition gives way to cooperation. The board expands into a
    sandbox where anything is possible.
