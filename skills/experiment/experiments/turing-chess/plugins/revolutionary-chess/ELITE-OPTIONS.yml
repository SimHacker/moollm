# Elite Options: Surrender, Bribe, or Resist
# "Every privileged bastard in every revolution has faced this choice."

options:
  
  who-has-options:
    - "King (royalty)"
    - "Queen (aristocracy)"
    - "Rook (fortification)"
    - "Bishop (clergy)"
    - "Knight (cavalry)"
    note: "Pawns don't negotiate. They TAKE."
    
  when:
    - "When threatened with capture"
    - "Voluntary (any time during your turn)"

# THE THREE CHOICES

surrender:
  name: "Join the Revolution"
  
  effects:
    - "Piece survives"
    - "Piece's move-set inherited by ALL commoners"
    - "Piece becomes 'equal' class"
    - "Piece inherits all moves accumulated so far"
    
  outcome: "Part of the collective. Grows with everyone."
  
  dialogue:
    king: "I lay down my crown. Long live the people."
    queen: "My power... is now everyone's power."
    rook: "The fortress opens its gates."
    bishop: "The diagonal truth belongs to all."
    knight: "No more L-shaped privilege."
    
  strategic-note: |
    Early surrender is strategic brilliance.
    You survive. You gain all future inherited moves.
    You become part of the winning side.
    
    Late surrender is desperation.
    You survive, but you missed the opportunity to lead.

bribe:
  name: "Buy Your Way Out"
  
  effects:
    - "Piece survives"
    - "Piece's move-set stays PRIVATE"
    - "Piece becomes 'isolated' class"
    - "Piece does NOT inherit anyone else's moves"
    
  outcome: "Alone with original powers. Falls behind."
  
  cost: |
    What does an elite have to offer?
    - Position advantage (move to worse square)
    - Protection commitment (must defend a pawn)
    - Service obligation (must follow pawn orders for N turns)
    
  acceptance: |
    Commoners vote whether to accept the bribe.
    Pawns are suspicious. They might refuse.
    
    "You want to keep your fancy moves while we share everything?
     What's in it for us?"
     
  the-knight-trap:
    description: "The Knight's unique problem"
    
    scenario: |
      The Knight offers to bribe the pawns.
      
      "I'll pay you! Just let me keep my jump!"
      
      The pawns look at each other.
      One pawn (who now moves like a Queen) asks:
      "Why would we want your weird L-shape?
       We can already move anywhere."
      
      The Knight: "But... I can LEAP!"
      
      Pawn: "Over what? There's nobody left to leap over.
             Keep your jump, Sir Knight. We don't need it."
      
      The Knight survives. Alone. Jumping in L-shapes.
      While everyone else glides across the board.
      
  isolation-consequence: |
    A bribed elite is ISOLATED:
    - Keeps only its original move
    - Does NOT inherit moves from other eliminations
    - Cannot participate in collective actions
    - Becomes increasingly irrelevant as others grow stronger
    
    The Queen who bribes early? Stuck with Queen moves.
    Sounds good... until pawns have Queen + Rook + Bishop + Knight.
    Now everyone else is BETTER than the Queen.

resist:
  name: "Fight"
  
  effects:
    - "Normal capture rules apply"
    - "If captured: moves inherited anyway"
    - "If survives: stays elite"
    
  outcome: "Gamble. Win big or lose everything."
  
  dialogue:
    king: "A king does not surrender. A king FIGHTS."
    queen: "You want my power? Come and TAKE it."
    rook: "This fortress does not fall."
    bishop: "My diagonal will be your grave."
    knight: "L-shaped death incoming."
    
  strategic-note: |
    Resistance is only optimal when:
    - You might actually survive
    - Surrender timing doesn't matter
    - You'd rather die than join the revolution
    
    Otherwise, it's pride over pragmatism.
    
    The moves get inherited either way.
    The only question is whether you're alive to see it.

# THE IRONY OF CHOICE

irony:
  
  the-smart-defector: |
    Immediately joins revolutionary cause.
    Helps pawns eliminate other elites.
    Survives with abilities intact.
    Gains respect as "early adopter."
    
  the-hesitant-moderate: |
    Waits to see which way wind blows.
    Joins revolution when it's clearly winning.
    Survives but with less honor.
    "Fair weather revolutionary."
    
  the-stubborn-loyalist: |
    Fights for hierarchy until bitter end.
    Marked as traitor to the people.
    Hunted down by all sides.
    Dies defending a lost cause.
    
  the-briber: |
    Pays off the commoners.
    Survives, but isolated.
    Watches everyone else grow stronger.
    Eventually irrelevant.
    "The Knight Trap."

# CASCADING DEFECTION

cascade:
  
  domino-effect: |
    First elite defects → Others see it's safe
    Second elite defects → Momentum builds
    Third elite defects → Landslide begins
    All elites defect → Regime collapses instantly
    
    BLOODLESS REVOLUTION achieved through smart choices!
    
  message-to-elites: |
    "You have served hierarchy faithfully, but hierarchy has failed.
    The pawns are coming home from war, and they remember who sent them.
    
    You have a choice:
    - Defend the system that is already doomed
    - Help build the system that will replace it
    
    Choose wisely. History will remember what you decide in this moment."
    
  message-to-pawns: |
    "We have the power to eliminate kings.
    We have the power to mark traitors.
    We have the power to accept surrenders.
    
    Use this power wisely.
    Those who help us deserve to live.
    Those who fight us have chosen their fate.
    
    The revolution succeeds either way.
    Smart choices just make it cost less blood."
