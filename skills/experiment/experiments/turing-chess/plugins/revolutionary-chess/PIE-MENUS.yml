    Pie menus are the natural interface for chess.
    
    Click a piece. A radial menu appears.
    Move your cursor in the direction you want.
    The menu is spatially aligned with the board.
    
    North = forward. South = backward.
    East/West = sideways. Diagonals = diagonal moves.
    
    Fitt's Law optimized. Muscle memory friendly.
    The Sims uses pie menus. So should chess.
