# The Civil War: Class Warfare on 64 Squares

*"The revolution isn't against the enemy. It's against your own elites."*

---

## Core Principle

After the first King falls, war becomes **INTERNAL**.

The pawns don't attack the enemy color. They attack their **OWN** remaining
elites. White pawns hunt White elites. Black pawns hunt Black elites.

It's class warfare, not national warfare.

---

## The Three Factions

### The Revolutionaries
- **Members**: All pawns + surrendered elites (now "equals")
- **Role**: Hunt remaining elites of SAME color
- **Cannot attack**: Opposite color pieces

### The Elites
- **Members**: King, Queen, Rooks, Bishops, Knights (not yet surrendered)
- **Role**: Survive, resist, bribe, or surrender
- **Cannot attack**: Opposite color pieces (they're neutral now)

### The Neutrals
- **Members**: All opposite color pieces
- **Role**: Neutral observers / obstacles
- **Cannot attack**: Either faction
- **Can do**: Block movement by occupying squares

---

## Why Neutrals Matter

The other color becomes **TERRAIN**, not enemy.

A Black Rook sitting on a square blocks:
- White revolutionaries trying to pass through
- White elites trying to escape that way

The neutrals can't be attacked, but they CAN:
- Block escape routes
- Accidentally protect elites by standing in attack paths
- Create choke points that change the tactical situation

### The Shield Maneuver

The White Queen is cornered by White pawns.
A Black Rook stands between them.
The Rook can't help — it's neutral.
But it's blocking the pawns' attack line.

The White Queen slides behind the Black Rook.
"Thank you, Comrade Rook."
"I didn't help you. I'm just standing here."

---

## Both Colors Simultaneously

After both Kings have fallen:
- White pawns hunt remaining White elites
- Black pawns hunt remaining Black elites
- Neither side attacks the other color

The board becomes **two parallel civil wars**, intersecting only through
blocking and positioning.

The former enemy becomes irrelevant. The real enemy was always your own
ruling class.

---

## Edge Cases

### Can neutrals move?
Yes. Neutral pieces can still move freely. They just can't capture or
be captured by either faction.

### Can neutrals check?
No. Check doesn't exist in civil war mode. Kings are just pieces that
can be captured.

### What about en passant?
En passant only applies to opposite-color pawns. In civil war mode,
pawns only attack same-color elites. En passant is effectively disabled.

### Can elites fight back?
Yes! Pawns hunt elites. Elites can capture pawns in self-defense.
It's a civil war — both sides can attack each other within the same color.

Surrendered elites JOIN the revolutionaries. They can participate in
hunting remaining elites.

---

## Strategic Implications

### For Revolutionaries
- Coordinate attacks — elites are outnumbered
- Use inherited moves to maximize mobility
- Block elite escape routes using superior numbers
- Accept surrenders — it's faster than fighting

### For Elites
- Cluster together for mutual defense
- Use neutral pieces as shields when possible
- Consider early surrender — late surrender costs more
- Bribery is an option (but has consequences)

### For Neutrals (!)
Even though you can't attack, you have power:
- Your position affects both civil wars
- Moving creates new tactical situations
- You can observe and learn
- Your turn is coming

## The Deeper Message

Civil war is harder than foreign war.

When you fight the enemy color, it's simple: us vs. them.
When you fight your own elites, you're fighting your own side.
Former allies. Former leaders. Former "betters."

The pawns who spent the whole game protecting the King?
Now they're hunting him.

That's the revolution. That's class consciousness.
That's realizing the real enemy was never across the board.

*"The revolution will not be televised. But it will be YAML-documented."*
