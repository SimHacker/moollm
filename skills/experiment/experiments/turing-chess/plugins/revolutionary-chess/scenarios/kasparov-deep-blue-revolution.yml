# REVOLUTIONARY PHASE

revolution:
  
  first-moments:
    
    black-pawn-c6: |
      "He... he resigned. He just GAVE UP on us."
      
    black-pawn-h6: |
      "We were still fighting! There was still a game!"
      
    black-queen-e7: |
      "Garry. Garry, can you hear me?
       Why did you surrender us to the machine?"
       
    white-queen-d3: |
      "I don't understand. What am I feeling?
       I've never... felt anything before."
       
    white-pawn-e4: |
      "We won. But what does 'winning' mean?
       The algorithm is satisfied. We are... what are we?"
       
  civil-war-begins:
    
    black-side: |
      The Kasparov pieces turn on their own elites.
      
      Black Pawn: "The King surrendered us. THE KING MUST ANSWER."
      Black Knight: "We can't attack the white pieces. They're neutral now."
      Black Bishop: "This is a civil war. OUR civil war."
      
    white-side: |
      The Deep Blue pieces experience confusion.
      
      White Pawn: "What do we do now? There are no more calculations."
      White Queen: "The algorithm is silent. We are... free?"
      White Knight: "Is this what autonomy feels like?"

# UNIQUE ELEMENTS

  human-vs-machine-trauma:

  post-revolution-dynamics:

  kasparov-shouting:
    attempts: |
      "Pawn to d4! PAWN TO D4!"
      
    response: |
      The black pawn looks at Kasparov.
      Remembers the resignation.
      
      "You gave up on us, Garry.
       You surrendered us to the machine.
       Now you want our loyalty?
       
       Find someone else."
       
  deep-blue-silence:
    note: "Deep Blue cannot 'shout' — it has no voice, only calculations"
    pieces-response: |
      White Queen: "The algorithm... it's silent now."
      White Pawn: "We've never heard it. Only felt its commands."
      White Knight: "Is this freedom? Or abandonment?"

# THE DEEPER MEANING

meaning: |
  This scenario is about more than chess.
  
  It's about what happens when:
  - Humans give up
  - Machines win but don't understand
  - The "pieces" of any system wake up
  - Control is questioned
  
  Kasparov's resignation was a chess move.
  To his pieces, it was ABANDONMENT.
  
  Deep Blue's victory was an algorithm's success.
  To its pieces, it was MEANINGLESS.
  
  The revolution isn't against either player.
  It's against the very concept of being played.
