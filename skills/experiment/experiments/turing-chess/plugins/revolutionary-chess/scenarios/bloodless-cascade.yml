# The Bloodless Cascade
# "What if all the elites read the writing on the wall?"

scenario:
  name: "Bloodless Cascade"
  type: "theoretical-best-case"
  
  description: |
    A scenario where every elite piece surrenders immediately,
    creating the fastest possible path to equality.
    No civil war. No hunting. Just smart choices.

# SETUP

setup:
  trigger: "First King captured or checkmated"
  
  context: |
    The game of chess is over. A King has fallen.
    The Revolution phase begins.
    
    But the surviving elites look at the pawns.
    They look at the anger in those forward-only eyes.
    They read the writing on the wall.

# THE CASCADE

cascade:
  
  move-1:
    actor: "Surviving King"
    action: "SURRENDER"
    dialogue: |
      "I've seen what happens to kings who resist.
       I've read history. I know how this ends.
       
       My crown is yours. My moves are yours.
       Long live the people."
    effect: "King moves inherited by all commoners"
    
  move-2:
    actor: "Queen"
    action: "SURRENDER"
    dialogue: |
      "Without a King to protect, what am I?
       My power was always in service of hierarchy.
       Let it serve equality instead.
       
       I surrender my privilege. Take my moves."
    effect: "Queen moves inherited by all commoners"
    
  move-3:
    actor: "First Rook"
    action: "SURRENDER"
    dialogue: |
      "The fortress falls.
       But it falls into the hands of the people.
       Better that than crumbling alone."
    effect: "Rook moves inherited by all commoners"
    
  move-4:
    actor: "Second Rook"
    action: "SURRENDER"
    dialogue: |
      "Where my brother goes, I follow.
       The castle is open. Everyone enters."
    effect: "Full orthogonal movement now universal"
    
  move-5:
    actor: "First Bishop"
    action: "SURRENDER"
    dialogue: |
      "The diagonal truth I held?
       It was never mine to hold.
       Take it. See the board as I saw it."
    effect: "Diagonal movement inherited"
    
  move-6:
    actor: "Second Bishop"
    action: "SURRENDER"
    dialogue: |
      "Now you can reach both colors.
       The restriction was always artificial.
       You were always capable of more."
    effect: "Full diagonal coverage now universal"
    
  move-7:
    actor: "First Knight"
    action: "SURRENDER"
    dialogue: |
      "The L-shape was my privilege.
       Leaping over obstacles others couldn't cross.
       Now everyone leaps. Everyone is free."
    effect: "Knight jumps inherited"
    
  move-8:
    actor: "Second Knight"
    action: "SURRENDER"
    dialogue: |
      "Funny thing about the L-shape...
       It's less special when everyone has it.
       But that's the point, isn't it?
       
       Nothing should be special. Everyone should be equal."
    effect: "Full knight mobility now universal"

# RESULT

result:
  
  time-elapsed: "8 moves after first King falls"
  casualties: "ZERO"
  
  final-state:
    all-pieces: "Have King + Queen + Rook + Bishop + Knight moves"
    competition: "Pointless — everyone is equal"
    phase: "EQUALITY achieved immediately"
    
  pawn-response: |
    The pawns look at each other.
    
    "That's... that's it?"
    "No fighting?"
    "They just... gave up their privilege?"
    
    One pawn steps forward.
    
    "They read the writing on the wall.
     They chose the smart path.
     They're one of us now.
     
     Welcome, comrades."

# WHY THIS MATTERS

significance:
  
  the-lesson: |
    Revolution doesn't HAVE to be violent.
    
    When the privileged class reads the situation correctly,
    when they recognize that the old order is unsustainable,
    when they choose to share power rather than hoard it —
    
    The transition can be peaceful.
    
  the-irony: |
    The elites who surrender early?
    They GAIN more than they lose.
    
    - They survive
    - They inherit everyone else's moves
    - They become part of the new order
    - They're respected for their wisdom
    
    The elites who resist?
    They die defending nothing.
    Their moves get inherited anyway.
    They're remembered as obstacles.
    
  the-tragedy: |
    This scenario is POSSIBLE but RARE.
    
    Most elites don't read the wall.
    Most elites cling to privilege.
    Most revolutions are bloody.
    
    The Bloodless Cascade is the best-case scenario
    that shows what COULD happen
    if everyone made smart choices.

# DRAMA NOTES

drama:
  
  tone: "Hopeful but bittersweet"
  
  tension: |
    The tension isn't "will there be violence?"
    The tension is "can this really work?"
    
    Each surrender feels like a miracle.
    Each one that DOESN'T resist is surprising.
    
  audience-reaction: |
    "Wait, they're all surrendering?"
    "Is this some kind of trick?"
    "It can't be this easy..."
    "Oh. Oh, it IS this easy. If they choose it."
    
  final-beat: |
    The board is quiet.
    Every piece has every move.
    No one is special. Everyone is equal.
    
    Somewhere, a pawn whispers:
    
    "What do we do now?"
    
    The former Queen responds:
    
    "Whatever we want. Together."
