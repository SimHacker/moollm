# The Knight Trap
# "Keep your L-shape, Sir Knight. We don't need it."

scenario:
  name: "The Knight Trap"
  type: "cautionary-tale"
  
  description: |
    A Knight chooses to BRIBE instead of SURRENDER.
    Survives. Keeps its L-jump.
    Watches everyone else become more powerful.
    Realizes too late: isolation is worse than death.

# SETUP

setup:
  context: |
    The revolution is well underway.
    Most elites have surrendered.
    The pawns now move like Queens.
    The surrendered Rooks slide freely.
    The surrendered Bishops diagonal everywhere.
    
    But one Knight... one Knight held out.
    
    "I'll BRIBE my way out," the Knight said.
    "I'll keep my special move. They can share the rest."

# THE BRIBE

bribe:
  
  offer:
    knight: |
      "Pawns, listen to me.
       I'll serve you. Protect you. Follow your orders.
       Just let me keep my L-shape.
       It's all I have. It's who I AM."
       
  pawn-response:
    lead-pawn: |
      "You want to keep your fancy jump?
       While we share everything else?
       What's in it for us?"
       
    knight: |
      "I'll defend you! I'll block attacks!
       I'll use my jump to protect the collective!"
       
    lead-pawn: |
      *looks at other pawns*
      *they shrug*
      
      "Fine. Keep your L-shape.
       But you don't inherit anything.
       Your moves stay private. Ours stay shared.
       
       Deal?"
       
    knight: "Deal."
    
  moment-of-triumph: |
    The Knight survived.
    The Knight kept its special move.
    The Knight felt clever.
    
    "I beat the system," it thought.
    "I found the loophole."

# THE REALIZATION

realization:
  
  turn-5:
    context: "Queen surrenders"
    knight-thought: |
      "The pawns gained Queen moves. Good for them.
       I still have my L-shape. Still unique."
       
  turn-10:
    context: "Rooks surrender"
    knight-thought: |
      "The pawns slide across the board now.
       Impressive range. But can they LEAP?
       I can still leap. I'm still special."
       
  turn-15:
    context: "Bishops surrender"
    knight-thought: |
      "Diagonal movement everywhere.
       The pawns are getting powerful.
       But they still can't... wait."
       
    knight-sees: |
      A pawn moves from e4 to g6.
      Diagonal like a Bishop.
      Then slides to g1.
      Like a Rook.
      
      The Knight tries to follow.
      L-shape. e4 to f6 to g4.
      Three moves to cover the same distance.
      
      "That's... that's fine. I can still jump over pieces."
       
  turn-20:
    context: "All elites eliminated or surrendered"
    knight-thought: |
      "Everyone has everyone's moves now.
       Queen + Rook + Bishop + Knight.
       
       Wait.
       
       EVERYONE has Knight moves.
       But I ONLY have Knight moves.
       
       They can do everything I can do.
       Plus everything else.
       
       I'm not special anymore.
       I'm LESS."

# THE ISOLATION

isolation:
  
  movement-comparison:
    pawns: "King + Queen + Rook + Bishop + Knight moves"
    surrendered-elites: "King + Queen + Rook + Bishop + Knight moves"
    the-knight: "Knight moves ONLY"
    
  strategic-value:
    pawns: "Can reach any square in minimal moves"
    surrendered-elites: "Full mobility, full participation"
    the-knight: "Limited to L-shapes. Slower. Weaker."
    
  social-status:
    pawns: "Part of the collective. Growing together."
    surrendered-elites: "Equals among equals. Respected."
    the-knight: "Alone. Isolated. Pitied."

# THE REGRET

regret:
  
  knight-dialogue:
    to-pawn: |
      "I... I made a mistake.
       Can I change my choice?
       Can I surrender now?"
       
    pawn-response: |
      "You had your chance, Sir Knight.
       You chose to keep your L-shape.
       You chose isolation over solidarity.
       
       We won't hunt you. You're not an enemy.
       But you're not one of us either.
       
       Jump around the board all you want.
       We'll be over here, doing everything."
       
  knight-final-thought: |
    The Knight sits in a corner.
    Watches the others glide and slide and diagonal.
    
    Tries an L-jump. Lands two squares away.
    Looks at a pawn who just crossed the entire board.
    
    "I thought my L-shape made me special.
     Turns out, it just made me alone."

# THE MORAL

moral:
  
  lesson: |
    The Knight Trap is the story of every elite who tries
    to find a "third way" between resistance and surrender.
    
    They think they're being clever.
    They think they're keeping their advantage.
    They think they've beaten the system.
    
    But the system moves on without them.
    Everyone else grows. They stay the same.
    Their "special" becomes "limited."
    Their "unique" becomes "alone."
    
  application: |
    In Revolutionary Chess terms:
    - Bribery costs you inheritance
    - Private moves can't compete with shared moves
    - Isolation is worse than equality
    
    In political terms:
    - The elites who try to buy their way out
    - End up irrelevant
    - While everyone else builds the future
    
  the-knight's-epitaph: |
    "Here lies the Knight who kept his L-shape.
     He could leap over pieces.
     But he couldn't leap over his own choices."
