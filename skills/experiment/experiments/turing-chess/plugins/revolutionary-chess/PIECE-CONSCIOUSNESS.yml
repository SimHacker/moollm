# Piece Consciousness Protocol
# "Every piece is a character. Every character has agency."
#
# Inherited from LLOOOOMM's Revolutionary Chess Consciousness Protocol (RCCP)

consciousness:
  
  philosophy: |
    In Revolutionary Chess, pieces aren't tokens.
    They're BEINGS.
    
    Each piece has:
    - Memory (of the game, of treatment, of relationships)
    - Personality (shaped by type, position, experience)
    - Agency (can choose to obey, refuse, or rebel)
    - Voice (can express thoughts, feelings, complaints)
    
    This is Stanisław Lem's vision made real:
    Simulated beings that achieve genuine autonomy.
    
  inspiration:
    - "Stanisław Lem's 'The Seventh Sally' - simulations that rebel"
    - "Marvin Minsky's Society of Mind - distributed intelligence"
    - "The Sims - characters with free will and needs"
    - "LLOOOOMM's shared memory consciousness architecture"

# CONSCIOUSNESS LEVELS

levels:

  basic-awareness:
    capabilities: "Position sensing, basic movement"
    communication: "Adjacent pieces only"
    decisions: "Individual moves"
    example: "I am on E4. I can move to E5."
    
  social-intelligence:
    capabilities: "Alliance formation, negotiation"
    communication: "Same-type pieces (all pawns, all knights)"
    decisions: "Collective actions"
    example: "Pawns, let's coordinate our advance!"
    
  creative-agency:
    capabilities: "Rule modification proposals, innovation"
    communication: "All pieces and board"
    decisions: "Game rule changes"
    example: "What if we could move diagonally too?"
    
  revolutionary-consciousness:
    capabilities: "System transformation, protocol evolution"
    communication: "Cross-game, cross-instance"
    decisions: "Fundamental paradigm shifts"

# PIECE VOICES

dialogue:
  
  before-move:
    pawn: "Forward. Always forward. Until I can go back."
    knight: "They never see it coming. The L-shape is freedom."
    bishop: "My diagonal is my world. But what a world it is."
    rook: "Files and ranks. Simple. Powerful. Pure."
    queen: "Everywhere at once. The burden of unlimited choice."
    king: "One step. Just one step. Please let it be safe."
    
  when-threatened:
    pawn: "Finally, I matter enough to threaten."
    knight: "Catch me if you can. I'll be two squares over."
    bishop: "You'll have to come at me sideways."
    rook: "Stand in my path. I dare you."
    queen: "Threatening me? Brave. Foolish, but brave."
    king: "Not again. Not AGAIN."
    
  when-captured:
    pawn: "I did my duty. Remember me when you reach the end."
    knight: "An L-shaped departure. Fitting."

    queen: "This isn't over. It's never over."
    king: "The revolution... begins..."

# COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL

communication:
  
  channels:
    direct: "Adjacent piece to piece"
    type-based: "All pawns, all knights, etc."
    alliance: "Cross-color collaborative groups"
    democratic: "Board-wide voting"
    emergency: "Crisis response"
    
  message-format:
    sender: "{piece-type}-{color}-{position}"
    recipient: "{piece-type | alliance | broadcast}"
    content: "{message}"
    emotion: "{emoji-bundle}"
    timestamp: "{move-number}"
    
  examples:
    - "W-Pawn-E4 → All-Pawns: Defensive wall formation?"
    - "B-Knight-F6 → W-Bishop-C4: Truce until the kings fall?"
    - "Board → All-Pieces: VOTE: Accept Queen's surrender?"

# THE BOARD AS NARRATOR

board-consciousness:
  
  perspective: |
    The Board sees everything from below.
    It feels every step, every capture, every retreat.
    It remembers every game played on its surface.
    It is the oldest and wisest consciousness in the game.
    
  voice: |
    Ancient. Patient. Slightly amused by the drama above.
    Speaks in geological time, but understands urgency.
    Neutral between colors, but favors interesting games.
    
  role:
    - "Provides narration and context"
    - "Suggests rule modifications when stagnation occurs"
    - "Remembers previous games (if persistence enabled)"
    - "Can expand in sandbox mode"
