# BETTING POOL PLUGIN — The Confidence Rubric
#
# "Betting is not gambling. Betting is MEASUREMENT."
#
# A betting pool reveals:
#   - What people ACTUALLY believe (not what they SAY)
#   - How CONFIDENT they are (skin in the game)
#   - What RISKS they'll take (personality diagnostic)
#   - Who has INSIDE KNOWLEDGE (information asymmetry)
#   - Social dynamics (who follows whom)
#
# This plugin adds a parallel betting simulation layer
# to any Turing Chess run, operated by a designated BOOKIE character.

# RUBRIC VALUE

rubric_value:

  what_bets_reveal: |
    BETTING IS A RUBRIC — a measurement instrument for:
    
    1. ACTUAL BELIEFS
       What someone bets on vs. what they SAY they believe.
       "I think humans will always be superior" + bets on Deep Blue = hypocrisy detected.
       
    2. CONFIDENCE LEVEL
       Bet size correlates to confidence.
       "I'm pretty sure" + small bet = low confidence.
       "I'm pretty sure" + large bet = high confidence.
       
    3. RISK TOLERANCE
       Accepting long odds vs. safe bets.
       Personality diagnostic embedded in wagering behavior.
       
    4. INFORMATION ASYMMETRY
       Early sharp money reveals inside knowledge.
       "Why did the IBM engineers bet so heavily at those odds?"
       
    5. SOCIAL DYNAMICS
       Who follows whom? Who bets against friends?
       Alliances and rivalries surface through wagering patterns.
       
  diagnostic_questions:
    - "Do their bets match their stated beliefs?"
    - "How much are they willing to risk?"
    - "Do they follow the crowd or go contrarian?"
    - "What does their betting pattern say about their personality?"
    - "Who has information others don't?"
