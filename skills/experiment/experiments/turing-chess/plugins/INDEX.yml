# PLANNED PLUGINS

planned:

  chess-fluxx:
    name: "Chess Fluxx"
    concept: |
      Combine Fluxx cards with chess rules.
      Draw cards, play actions that change the rules mid-game.
      "New Rule: Knights can jump over pieces AND capture them."
      
  audience-democracy:
    name: "Audience Democracy"
    concept: |
      The audience votes on moves for one (or both) players.
      Twitch Plays Chess, but dramatized.
      
  time-travel:
    name: "Time Travel Chess"
    concept: |
      Extension points for UNDO, REDO, BRANCH.
      "What if I hadn't moved that pawn?"
      Alternative timelines, parallel games.
      
  ghost-pieces:
    name: "Ghost Pieces"
    concept: |
      Captured pieces remain on the board as ghosts.
      They can't be captured again, but they remember.
      They haunt the squares where they died.
      
  piece-consciousness:
    name: "The Autonomous 32"
    concept: |
      Full implementation of LLOOOOMM's democratic chess.
      Every piece has a voice. Every piece votes.
      The game ends when the game chooses.
