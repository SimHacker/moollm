PHOTO H11b: "The Universe Remembered"

SETTING: Gezelligheid Grotto underground pub. Late session, dramatic moment. Stone walls, candlelight creating strong shadows.

THE TURN CARD: 4 of Hearts just dealt — completing the wheel

THE BOARD: 7 of Clubs, 5 of Diamonds, 3 of Spades, 4 of Hearts
(A-2-3-4-5 straight now possible)

PALM'S REVEALED CARDS: Ace of Hearts, 2 of Hearts — THE WHEEL

PALM'S STATE — FIRST REAL SMILE:
- Silver tabby fur RIPPLING visibly
- Whiskers angled FORWARD
- ACTUAL SMILE forming (extremely rare)
- Gold eyes bright with joy
- Tail uncurling then curling happily
- Expression: quiet joy, cosmic justice
- "The universe remembered."

BUMBLEWICK'S REVEALED CARDS: King of Diamonds, King of Clubs — DOOMED

BUMBLEWICK'S STATE — PROCESSING:
- Staring at the 4 of Hearts
- Large eyes tracking the board
- Mouth slightly open in shock
- NOT YET CRYING (important)
- Expression: beginning to process, not yet acceptance
- "What's... what's a wheel?"

OBSERVERS:

DON — cheese knife lowered gently, expression sympathetic for Bumblewick. Soft concerned eyes.

DONNA — hand over mouth, eyes moving between board and Bumblewick. Watching how he'll react.

TABLE: All-in pot going to Palm. The dealt turn card (4♥) prominent. Both hands revealed face-up.

LIGHTING: Revelation lighting — dramatic, highlighting the fateful card.

MOOD: The turn of fortune. Justice for Palm's earlier bad beats. The moment before Bumblewick's response.
