PHOTO H07: "Donna Showed Me the Trap"

SETTING: Gezelligheid Grotto underground pub. Deep into the session — intimate lighting, comfortable atmosphere. Stone walls, candle glow.

CAMERA: Over-the-shoulder behind Bumblewick, showing his confident posture. His cards tucked but visible to camera. Don in focus across table.

SUBJECT: BUMBLEWICK — young goblin on booster seat, pale green skin, oversized vest.

BUMBLEWICK'S TRANSFORMED STATE:
- Hands STEADY (not trembling!)
- Ears LEVEL (not drooped!)
- Direct eye contact with Don across table
- Shoulders back, posture improved
- Chips being pushed forward confidently
- Small jaw set with determination
- Expression: confident pride, executing learned strategy

HIS CARDS (tucked, visible to camera): Ace of Diamonds, Ace of Spades

THE BOARD: Ace of Clubs, 7 of Spades, 4 of Diamonds, Jack of Diamonds
(Bumblewick flopped a SET, has been trapping)

TARGET — DON HOPKINS across table:
- Stocky 60s human, gray wild hair, cardigan
- Cheese knife SET DOWN (acknowledging seriousness)
- Head tilted, evaluating the raise
- Small smile forming — recognition and respect
- Expression: "You have the ace. Well played, little one."

OBSERVERS (soft focus):

DONNA TOADSTOOL — slight nod, watching her student execute. Pride in large toad eyes. Her slowplay being mirrored.

PALM — silver cat on cushion, whisker twitch of approval, impressed fur posture.

TABLE: Large pot building. Bumblewick's cheese wedge UNTOUCHED on table beside him (he's focusing). Don's stack diminishing.

LIGHTING: Tension lighting but with warmth — the student proving himself.

MOOD: The student becomes dangerous. Bumblewick executing the trap Donna taught him.

DIALOGUE MOMENT: Bumblewick says "Raise. Six hundred." — firm voice, no wobble.

STYLE: Warm painterly illustration, coming-of-age moment, fantasy poker scene, mentor-student dynamic.
