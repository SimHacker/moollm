PHOTO H05: "Set"

SETTING: Gezelligheid Grotto underground pub. Post-pardon warmth — brighter candles, air of reconciliation. Stone walls, wooden table worn smooth.

CAMERA: Face close-up on Donna, shot from across table. Her face and cards in sharp focus, others soft.

SUBJECT: DONNA TOADSTOOL — squat toad/humanoid in formal blazer with pearls. Mottled brown-green bumpy skin.

DONNA'S STATE:
- FIRST GENUINE SMILE since returning to the game
- Wide toad mouth curved upward
- Large eyes SOFTENED (not bulging)
- Chin raised slightly with pride
- Cards being turned over with deliberate grace
- Shoulders relaxed, no tension
- Expression: quiet triumph, "I'm back"

HER CARDS REVEALED: Queen of Diamonds, Queen of Clubs — turning them face up

THE BOARD visible: Queen of Spades, 7 of Hearts, 2 of Diamonds, 3 of Clubs
(She flopped a SET of Queens)

OBSERVERS (soft focus):

BUMBLEWICK — ears PERKING UP (not drooping!), eyes wide with admiration, small goblin mouth open in realization. His folded cards nearby. Expression: "That's what I did to Palm!"

DON HOPKINS — slight approving nod, cheese wedge in hand, crinkled eyes warm. Respect in expression.

PALM — silver cat giving slow blink (highest cat approval), whiskers neutral, fur smooth.

TABLE: Pot being pulled to Donna. Bumblewick's chips still large (he folded correctly). Cheese being passed around the table.

LIGHTING: Relief lighting — warmer, more even glow. Post-tension release.

MOOD: The return of a competitor. Donna's first real poker success since being pardoned.

DIALOGUE MOMENT: She's saying "Set." — one word, controlled, powerful.

STYLE: Warm painterly illustration, triumph lighting, fantasy poker scene, character redemption moment.
