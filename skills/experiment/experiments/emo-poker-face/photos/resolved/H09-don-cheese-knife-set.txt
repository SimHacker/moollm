PHOTO H09: "The Smuggler Provides"

=== COHERENCE CONTEXT (from SCENE.yml and series) ===

This is photo 5 of 8 in the "Emotional Poker Face" series.
Maintain these constants across ALL photos:

GROTTO: Underground pub, rough-hewn stone walls with moss, low vaulted ceiling, candle sconces, worn flagstone floor with sawdust. Dutch "gezellig" aesthetic.

TABLE: Round dark oak pie table ~5ft diameter, worn smooth. Clay chips (white/red/blue/black). Worn playing cards. Large wooden cheese board with sharp cheddar wheel and ornate silver knife.

CHARACTERS (consistent appearance):
- DON HOPKINS: Human male 60s, stocky, gray wild hair, comfortable cardigan rolled sleeves, warm weathered features
- PALM: Silver tabby cat, large, on elevated cushion, luminescent fur, gold ancient eyes, long expressive whiskers
- BUMBLEWICK: Young goblin, pale green mottled skin, large expressive ears, oversized vest too many pockets, on booster seat
- DONNA TOADSTOOL: Toad/humanoid, squat, formal blazer with pearls, mottled brown-green bumpy skin, large prominent eyes

Timeline: POST-CHEESE CEREMONY — Don has "owned" being the cheese smuggler. Abundance of cheese. Generous atmosphere. Table feels like family now.

CHEESE STATE: Being actively sliced and distributed. This is the peak of Don's hospitality — AND he has a monster hand.

The SAME ornate silver cheese knife from earlier photos, but now ACTIVE in Don's hand.

=== END COHERENCE CONTEXT ===

SETTING: Gezelligheid Grotto underground pub. Post-cheese-ceremony warmth — bright candles, generous atmosphere. The tension about cheese smuggling has been broken into camaraderie.

CAMERA: Low angle hands detail shot, focusing on Don's hands. One hand pushing chips, other holding cheese knife mid-slice. Face visible but soft.

SUBJECT: DON HOPKINS — stocky human male, 60s, gray wild hair, comfortable cardigan with rolled sleeves.

DON'S STATE — THE CHEESE KNIFE TELL:
- LEFT HAND pushing 200 chips forward (betting)
- RIGHT HAND holding ornate silver cheese knife MID-SLICE
- Sharp cheddar wheel being cut simultaneously
- Relaxed shoulders, casual posture
- Crinkled eyes with soft smile
- Humming softly (audible contentment)
- MULTITASKING confidence — hosting while holding a monster

HIS CARDS (peeking from table edge): 5 of Clubs, 5 of Diamonds

THE BOARD: 5 of Hearts, King of Diamonds, 3 of Spades
(Don has flopped a SET OF FIVES while slicing cheese)

CHEESE BOARD: Large wooden board, sharp cheddar wheel being actively sliced. Wedges ready to distribute. The "smuggled" cheese everyone now enjoys openly.

OPPONENTS (soft focus):

DONNA — leaning forward, interested, has top pair (King). About to raise into his set. Unaware.

PALM — silver cat accepting offered cheese wedge, content, missed the flop.

BUMBLEWICK — munching cheese happily, mouth full, watching with joy.

TABLE: Growing pot. Chips being pushed casually with one hand. General abundance of cheese.

LIGHTING: Camaraderie lighting — soft, inclusive warmth. Post-tension hospitality.

MOOD: Hospitality hiding a monster. The cheese knife is the tell nobody expected.

DIALOGUE MOMENT: "I'll bet. 200. And does anyone want more cheddar?"

STYLE: Warm painterly illustration, cozy pub atmosphere, fantasy poker scene, focus on hands and cheese knife.
