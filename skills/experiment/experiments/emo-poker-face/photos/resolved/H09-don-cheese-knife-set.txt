PHOTO H09: "The Smuggler Provides"

SETTING: Gezelligheid Grotto underground pub. Post-cheese-ceremony warmth — bright candles, generous atmosphere. The tension about cheese smuggling has been broken into camaraderie.

CAMERA: Low angle hands detail shot, focusing on Don's hands. One hand pushing chips, other holding cheese knife mid-slice. Face visible but soft.

SUBJECT: DON HOPKINS — stocky human male, 60s, gray wild hair, comfortable cardigan with rolled sleeves.

DON'S STATE — THE CHEESE KNIFE TELL:
- LEFT HAND pushing 200 chips forward (betting)
- RIGHT HAND holding ornate silver cheese knife MID-SLICE
- Sharp cheddar wheel being cut simultaneously
- Relaxed shoulders, casual posture
- Crinkled eyes with soft smile
- Humming softly (audible contentment)
- MULTITASKING confidence — hosting while holding a monster

HIS CARDS (peeking from table edge): 5 of Clubs, 5 of Diamonds

THE BOARD: 5 of Hearts, King of Diamonds, 3 of Spades
(Don has flopped a SET OF FIVES while slicing cheese)

CHEESE BOARD: Large wooden board, sharp cheddar wheel being actively sliced. Wedges ready to distribute. The "smuggled" cheese everyone now enjoys openly.

OPPONENTS (soft focus):

DONNA — leaning forward, interested, has top pair (King). About to raise into his set. Unaware.

PALM — silver cat accepting offered cheese wedge, content, missed the flop.

BUMBLEWICK — munching cheese happily, mouth full, watching with joy.

TABLE: Growing pot. Chips being pushed casually with one hand. General abundance of cheese.

LIGHTING: Camaraderie lighting — soft, inclusive warmth. Post-tension hospitality.

MOOD: Hospitality hiding a monster. The cheese knife is the tell nobody expected.

DIALOGUE MOMENT: "I'll bet. 200. And does anyone want more cheddar?"

STYLE: Warm painterly illustration, cozy pub atmosphere, fantasy poker scene, focus on hands and cheese knife.
