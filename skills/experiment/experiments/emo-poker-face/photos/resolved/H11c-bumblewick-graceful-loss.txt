PHOTO H11c: "That's Poker"

SETTING: Gezelligheid Grotto underground pub. Late session, warm aftermath. Stone walls, candles creating intimate glow. The most important moment of the night.

CAMERA: Face close-up on Bumblewick, eye level, intimate. Sharp focus on his expression and the hand reaching for cheese. Others soft but visible.

SUBJECT: BUMBLEWICK — young goblin on booster seat, pale green mottled skin, large ears, oversized vest.

BUMBLEWICK'S STATE — ARC COMPLETION:
- NO TEARS on his face (critical detail)
- Eyes DRY and CLEAR
- Small SMILE forming
- Ears LEVEL, not drooped
- Deep breath, shoulders relaxed
- Hand REACHING FOR cheese wedge
- Expression: mature acceptance, peace
- He has GROWN UP in this moment

ACTION: His small green hand picking up the cheese wedge, bringing it toward his mouth. The act of eating = acceptance.

DIALOGUE: "Good hand, Palm. That's poker."

HIS LOST CARDS: King of Diamonds, King of Clubs — lost but not defeated

OBSERVERS' REACTIONS:

DON HOPKINS — eyes slightly shining with emotion. Cutting an EXTRA LARGE wedge of cheese for Bumblewick. Expression: profound pride and respect. "THAT is how you handle a bad beat."

DONNA TOADSTOOL — ACTUAL TEARS visible on her toad cheeks. Hand at chest. Large eyes watering. Expression: overwhelming pride. "He didn't cry. HE didn't cry."

PALM — warm respect visible in gold ancient eyes. Slow blink (highest approval). Pushing the pot aside as secondary to this moment. "The wheel gave justice. This gives more."

TABLE: Pot going to Palm but visually unimportant. Bumblewick's cheese wedge being lifted. Don's extra wedge being offered.

LIGHTING: Camaraderie lighting — warm, embracing, celebratory of growth not victory.

MOOD: The completion of a character arc. Bumblewick becoming a poker player. The others witnessing transformation.

THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PHOTO. It captures the moment Bumblewick went from terrified beginner (H01) to graceful competitor.

STYLE: Warm painterly illustration, emotional climax, fantasy poker scene, character transformation, intimate portrait of growth.
