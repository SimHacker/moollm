PHOTO H11a: "Serious Mode"

SETTING: Gezelligheid Grotto underground pub. Late session — intimate atmosphere, comfortable familiarity among players. Stone walls, warm candlelight.

CAMERA: Face close-up on Bumblewick, slightly below eye level looking up at him. Focus on his face and the hand setting down cheese.

SUBJECT: BUMBLEWICK — young goblin on booster seat, pale green mottled skin, large expressive ears, oversized vest.

BUMBLEWICK'S STATE — THE CHEESE PUT DOWN TELL:
- Hand DELIBERATELY SETTING DOWN cheese wedge on table
- NOT eating — this is intentional
- Deep breath visible (chest expanding)
- Ears LEVEL (not drooped, not over-perked)
- Eyes focused, clear, NOT watery
- Small jaw set with determination
- Expression: focused resolve, "I know how to play kings now"

HIS CARDS (just peeked at): King of Diamonds, King of Clubs

THE CHEESE WEDGE being set down beside his chip stack — a deliberate action that signals "serious mode" to those watching.

OBSERVERS' REACTIONS:

DONNA — eyebrows raised, noting the cheese. She recognizes the tell. "He put down the cheese."

DON — his own cheese knife paused in mid-air. Understanding in his eyes. "The cheese knife is on the table."

PALM — silver cat calculating, short stack considering options. Whiskers thoughtful.

TABLE: Large stack in front of Bumblewick, 500 chips being pushed forward. Various states of cheese consumption around the table — but Bumblewick's wedge is set ASIDE.

LIGHTING: Tension lighting — dramatic shadows, focus on the decision moment.

MOOD: The tell everyone reads correctly. Donna and Don both folding because of the cheese.

DIALOGUE MOMENT: Bumblewick says "Raise. 500." — firm voice, no wobble.

STYLE: Warm painterly illustration, decisive moment, fantasy poker scene, focus on the cheese being deliberately set down.
