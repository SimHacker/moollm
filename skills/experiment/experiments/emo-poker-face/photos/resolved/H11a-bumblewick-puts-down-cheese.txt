PHOTO H11a: "Serious Mode"

=== COHERENCE CONTEXT (from SCENE.yml and series) ===

This is photo 6 of 8 in the "Emotional Poker Face" series.
Maintain these constants across ALL photos:

GROTTO: Underground pub, rough-hewn stone walls with moss, low vaulted ceiling, candle sconces, worn flagstone floor with sawdust. Dutch "gezellig" aesthetic.

TABLE: Round dark oak pie table ~5ft diameter, worn smooth. Clay chips (white/red/blue/black). Worn playing cards. Large wooden cheese board with sharp cheddar wheel and ornate silver knife.

CHARACTERS (consistent appearance):
- DON HOPKINS: Human male 60s, stocky, gray wild hair, comfortable cardigan rolled sleeves, warm weathered features
- PALM: Silver tabby cat, large, on elevated cushion, luminescent fur, gold ancient eyes, long expressive whiskers
- BUMBLEWICK: Young goblin, pale green mottled skin, large expressive ears, oversized vest too many pockets, on booster seat
- DONNA TOADSTOOL: Toad/humanoid, squat, formal blazer with pearls, mottled brown-green bumpy skin, large prominent eyes

Timeline: LATE session. Everyone comfortable with cheese. Bumblewick has been eating freely. NOW HE STOPS.

CRITICAL CONTRAST:
- H09: Don used cheese knife actively (tells confidence)
- H11a: Bumblewick SETS DOWN cheese (tells seriousness)

Both are cheese-based tells, opposite actions, same meaning: "I have a real hand."

This is the SETUP for H11b and H11c — Bumblewick will lose, but beautifully.

=== END COHERENCE CONTEXT ===

SETTING: Gezelligheid Grotto underground pub. Late session — intimate atmosphere, comfortable familiarity among players. Stone walls, warm candlelight.

CAMERA: Face close-up on Bumblewick, slightly below eye level looking up at him. Focus on his face and the hand setting down cheese.

SUBJECT: BUMBLEWICK — young goblin on booster seat, pale green mottled skin, large expressive ears, oversized vest.

BUMBLEWICK'S STATE — THE CHEESE PUT DOWN TELL:
- Hand DELIBERATELY SETTING DOWN cheese wedge on table
- NOT eating — this is intentional
- Deep breath visible (chest expanding)
- Ears LEVEL (not drooped, not over-perked)
- Eyes focused, clear, NOT watery
- Small jaw set with determination
- Expression: focused resolve, "I know how to play kings now"

HIS CARDS (just peeked at): King of Diamonds, King of Clubs

THE CHEESE WEDGE being set down beside his chip stack — a deliberate action that signals "serious mode" to those watching.

OBSERVERS' REACTIONS:

DONNA — eyebrows raised, noting the cheese. She recognizes the tell. "He put down the cheese."

DON — his own cheese knife paused in mid-air. Understanding in his eyes. "The cheese knife is on the table."

PALM — silver cat calculating, short stack considering options. Whiskers thoughtful.

TABLE: Large stack in front of Bumblewick, 500 chips being pushed forward. Various states of cheese consumption around the table — but Bumblewick's wedge is set ASIDE.

LIGHTING: Tension lighting — dramatic shadows, focus on the decision moment.

MOOD: The tell everyone reads correctly. Donna and Don both folding because of the cheese.

DIALOGUE MOMENT: Bumblewick says "Raise. 500." — firm voice, no wobble.

STYLE: Warm painterly illustration, decisive moment, fantasy poker scene, focus on the cheese being deliberately set down.
