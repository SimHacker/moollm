SETTING: Gezelligheid Grotto underground pub. Stone walls, low vaulted ceiling, candle sconces. Later evening — some candles burning lower. Warm amber light with dramatic side shadows.

THE SHOWDOWN:

DONNA TOADSTOOL (losing) — squat toad/humanoid in formal blazer with pearls. Her cards face up: King of Clubs, King of Hearts. 

DONNA'S STATE:
- NOT standing (she learned control)
- Eyes closed briefly, deep breath visible
- Hands flat on table, accepting
- Wide mouth set in dignified line
- Throat pouch NOT inflating (controlled)
- Expression: graceful acceptance of defeat

PALM (winning) — silver tabby cat on cushion. Cards face up: Ace of Clubs, Ace of Diamonds.

PALM'S STATE:
- Fur slightly shimmering with satisfaction
- Whiskers neutral, not gloating
- Tail curled contentedly
- Gold eyes gentle
- Expression: quiet dignity in victory

LARGE POT of chips about to go to Palm.

OBSERVERS:

DON HOPKINS — stocky 60s human, gray hair, cardigan. Expression respectful, watching Donna. Cheese knife lowered, giving the moment space. Warm concerned eyes.

BUMBLEWICK — young green goblin on booster seat. Ears drooped with sympathy, large watery eyes looking at Donna with concern. Small hands clasped.

TABLE: Donna's side empty of chips — eliminated. Palm's stack about to double. Cheese board half consumed, knife resting.

LIGHTING: Revelation lighting — dramatic side lighting on Donna's face as she accepts defeat.

MOOD: The dignity in defeat. Donna losing with grace, saying "Good hand."

STYLE: Warm painterly illustration, dramatic chiaroscuro, fantasy poker scene, intimate moment of sportsmanship.
