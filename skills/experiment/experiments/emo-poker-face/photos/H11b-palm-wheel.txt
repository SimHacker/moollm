PHOTO H11b: "The Universe Remembered"

=== COHERENCE CONTEXT (from SCENE.yml and series) ===

This is photo 7 of 8 in the "Emotional Poker Face" series.
Maintain these constants across ALL photos:

GROTTO: Underground pub, rough-hewn stone walls with moss, low vaulted ceiling, candle sconces, worn flagstone floor with sawdust. Dutch "gezellig" aesthetic.

TABLE: Round dark oak pie table ~5ft diameter, worn smooth. Clay chips (white/red/blue/black). Worn playing cards. Large wooden cheese board with sharp cheddar wheel and ornate silver knife.

CHARACTERS (consistent appearance):
- DON HOPKINS: Human male 60s, stocky, gray wild hair, comfortable cardigan rolled sleeves, warm weathered features
- PALM: Silver tabby cat, large, on elevated cushion, luminescent fur, gold ancient eyes, long expressive whiskers
- BUMBLEWICK: Young goblin, pale green mottled skin, large expressive ears, oversized vest too many pockets, on booster seat
- DONNA TOADSTOOL: Toad/humanoid, squat, formal blazer with pearls, mottled brown-green bumpy skin, large prominent eyes

Timeline: IMMEDIATELY after H11a. Bumblewick put down cheese to raise with kings. Palm called short. Now the turn card changes everything.

PALM'S ARC: Earlier (Hands 6, 8), Palm was sucked out on TWICE by Don. Now the universe gives back. First REAL smile of the night.

BUMBLEWICK'S ARC: In H01 he trembled with aces. In H11a he was composed with kings. In H11b he's processing a bad beat — NOT YET graceful, but NOT crying either. The grace comes in H11c.

=== END COHERENCE CONTEXT ===

SETTING: Gezelligheid Grotto underground pub. Late session, dramatic moment. Stone walls, candlelight creating strong shadows.

CAMERA: Table-wide overhead angle showing the board and all players' reactions. Cards and board sharp, faces in focus.

THE TURN CARD: 4 of Hearts just dealt — completing the wheel

THE BOARD: 7 of Clubs, 5 of Diamonds, 3 of Spades, 4 of Hearts
(A-2-3-4-5 straight now possible)

PALM'S REVEALED CARDS: Ace of Hearts, 2 of Hearts — THE WHEEL

PALM'S STATE — FIRST REAL SMILE:
- Silver tabby fur RIPPLING visibly
- Whiskers angled FORWARD
- ACTUAL SMILE forming (extremely rare)
- Gold eyes bright with joy
- Tail uncurling then curling happily
- Expression: quiet joy, cosmic justice
- "The universe remembered."

BUMBLEWICK'S REVEALED CARDS: King of Diamonds, King of Clubs — DOOMED

BUMBLEWICK'S STATE — PROCESSING:
- Staring at the 4 of Hearts
- Large eyes tracking the board
- Mouth slightly open in shock
- NOT YET CRYING (important)
- Expression: beginning to process, not yet acceptance
- "What's... what's a wheel?"

OBSERVERS:

DON — cheese knife lowered gently, expression sympathetic for Bumblewick. Soft concerned eyes.

DONNA — hand over mouth, eyes moving between board and Bumblewick. Watching how he'll react.

TABLE: All-in pot going to Palm. The dealt turn card (4♥) prominent. Both hands revealed face-up.

LIGHTING: Revelation lighting — dramatic, highlighting the fateful card.

MOOD: The turn of fortune. Justice for Palm's earlier bad beats. The moment before Bumblewick's response.

STYLE: Warm painterly illustration, dramatic reveal, fantasy poker scene, cosmic justice moment.
