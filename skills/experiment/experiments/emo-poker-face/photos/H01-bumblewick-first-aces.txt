=== END COHERENCE CONTEXT ===

SETTING: Cozy underground pub/speakeasy called Gezelligheid Grotto. Rough-hewn stone walls with moss in crevices, low vaulted ceiling with candle sconces. Warm amber candlelight creating pools of shadow. Round dark oak pie table worn smooth by generations.

CAMERA: Over-the-shoulder shot behind Bumblewick, slightly elevated. His cards visible to camera (Ace of Spades, Ace of Hearts). Other three players visible across the table in soft focus.

SUBJECT: BUMBLEWICK — young goblin with pale green mottled skin, large expressive ears currently DROOPED at 45 degrees, oversized vest with too many pockets, sitting on booster seat.

BUMBLEWICK'S STATE:
- Hands VISIBLY TREMBLING as they hold the two aces
- Eyes wide, large, slightly watery with emotion
- Shoulders hunched forward nervously  
- Small green fingers gripping cards too tightly
- Expression: terrified excitement, doesn't know what to do with the best hand

HIS CARDS VISIBLE: Ace of Spades and Ace of Hearts — premium pocket aces

ACROSS THE TABLE (soft focus):

DON HOPKINS — stocky human male in his 60s, gray wild hair, comfortable cardigan with rolled sleeves. Head tilted with curiosity, soft amused smile. Holding ornate silver cheese knife, paused mid-slice over sharp cheddar wheel. Warm weathered features.

PALM — large silver tabby cat on elevated cushion, luminescent fur with darker stripes, gold ancient eyes. Whiskers angled forward alertly, ears rotated toward Bumblewick. Perfectly still, observing.

DONNA TOADSTOOL — squat toad/humanoid in formal blazer with pearls. Mottled brown-green bumpy skin, large prominent eyes currently narrowed skeptically. One eyebrow raised, adjusting her pearl necklace.

TABLE: Clay poker chips in stacks (white/red/blue/black). Bumblewick has smallest stack, nervously arranged. Fresh full wheel of sharp cheddar cheese, knife resting on wooden board. Worn playing cards face down in front of each player. Small pot of just blinds in center.

LIGHTING: Tension lighting — deeper shadows, single candle highlighting Bumblewick's trembling hands.

MOOD: The moment before everything changes. A terrified beginner holding the best possible hand.

STYLE: Warm painterly illustration, amber candlelight atmosphere, fantasy poker scene, intimate cozy pub setting.
