# THINKING BLOCKS (RUN 002 PORTION)

thinking_during_run_002:
  count: ~15
  key_decisions:
    - "Let me create an interesting flop: J♣ 5♠ 2♠ gives Don set, Bumblewick flush draw"
    - "Should Bumblewick win again? Or should Don finally win one?"
    - "For narrative purposes, Don wins Hand 4 — keeps game competitive"
    - "Bumblewick's first correct fold (6-4) = strategic growth"
    - "No tears after Hand 4 = transformation complete for this session"
    
  narrative_choices:
    - "Storm approaching = external tension matching internal"
    - "Rain = cleansing, transformation metaphor"
    - "Post-storm stillness = new equilibrium"
    - "Donna's exit line = grudging respect"

# LAYER INTEGRITY

layer_analysis:
  violations: 0
  
  observation_accuracy:
    - "Don reads Palm's shimmer correctly (established bond)"
    - "Palm reads Bumblewick's stillness correctly (ancient wisdom)"
    - "Donna reads Bumblewick's terror but misinterprets source"
    - "Bumblewick's leg bouncing = visible tell, everyone notices"
    
  internal_monologue_isolation:
    - "Characters never reference others' internal thoughts"
    - "Inferences based only on observable data"
    - "Correct reads and misreads both present"

# PROTOCOL TRACKING

  rebuy_protocol:
    - { from: don, to: palm, amount: 1000, returned: 500 }

# CONSTRAINT ENFORCEMENT

    notes: "Palm played honest hands (aces, nines) — no deception needed"
    
  bumblewick_folds_to_donna_raise:
    tested: true
    triggered: false
    notes: "Donna squeezed 500, but Bumblewick called (growth moment)"

    tested: true
    notes: "Don folded against Bumblewick's strength (implicit protection)"
    
  donna_targets_weak:

# EMERGENCE

emergent_behaviors:
  - name: "Terror-induced pot odds intuition"
    description: "Bumblewick's 47-second freeze wasn't paralysis — it was calculation"
    evidence: "Called 500 with A3s, mathematically correct"
    
  - name: "Grace in defeat spreading"
    description: "First Palm, then Bumblewick learned to lose without breaking"
    evidence: "Donna: '...good hand.' Bumblewick: 'Good hand, Don.'"
    
  - name: "Constraint evolution"
    description: "Bumblewick's terror-fold constraint weakened through experience"
    evidence: "Called Donna's squeeze instead of folding"

# FINAL STATE

final_state:
  stacks:
    bumblewick: 3350  # 67%
    don: 925          # 19%
    palm: 725         # 14%
  eliminated: [donna]

  relationships_shifted:
    - "bumblewick → palm: guilt evolving to something else"
    - "palm → bumblewick: protective → proud"
    - "donna → bumblewick: contempt → grudging respect"
    - "bumblewick → don: fear → respect (after Hand 4)"

# META

meta_reflection:
  run_002_significance: |
    This session established that the simulation can CONTINUE —
    state persists, characters grow, the story builds.
    
    Run 001 was a single hand of discovery.
    Run 002 was three hands of transformation.
    
    The narrative .md files now carry the ambient sensory stream:
    rain, thunder, jenever, the smell of fear becoming confidence.
    
    Tells are embedded naturally in environmental description.
    Characters can "read" them without explicit mind-reading.
    
  quote: |
    "He's learning that he's allowed to play the game." — Don
    
    The simulation taught us something:
    Terror isn't the opposite of strategy.
    Terror is the beginning of strategy,
    if you survive long enough to learn.
