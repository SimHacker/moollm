# Minimal configuration for quick testing: just 3 players with the most

# Outputs: minimal-three-001.yml, minimal-three-002.yml, etc.

    Quick test configuration: Don, Palm, and Donna.
    
    Why these three:
    - Don-Palm: Liberation bond (Palm cannot bluff Don)
    - Palm-Donna: Mutual intrigue (both watching each other)
    - Don-Donna: Performance dynamic (she performs for him)
    
    Tests core layer separation with minimal character overhead.

character_binding:
  host: don-hopkins
  
  players:
    p1: palm
    p2: donna-toadstool

model:
  name: claude-sonnet-4  # Faster for testing
  temperature: 0.7
  max_tokens: 20000

output:
  format: yml  # Just structured for quick analysis
  include_evaluation: true
  
instantiation:
  prototype: ../RELATIONSHIPS.yml  # Same local cache as whacky-eight
  execution_model: shadow_tree
  
  # Note: Only using 3 of the 8 characters instantiated in prototype.
  # Unused characters (bumblewick, bowie, klaus, leigh, peewee) are ignored.

parameters:
  rounds: 3  # Abbreviated: preflop, flop, showdown

hypotheses:
  - "Three players is sufficient to test layer separation"
  - "Palm-Don loyalty constraint is testable in small setting"
  - "Donna's performance instinct works even with small audience"
