# CHARACTER TELL EVOLUTION

bumblewick_tell_arc:
  session_1: |
    Trembling, wobbling, tears after any action
    LOUDEST tells on table
    
  session_3: |
    "Voice only slightly wobbly"
    Learning control
    
  session_5: |
    "Sets down cheese" = serious mode (NEW tell)
    "Reaches for cheese, STOPS" = discipline
    "Picks up cheese, nibbles" = acceptance
    
    CHEESE BECOMES EMOTIONAL REGULATOR
    
  arc: "Uncontrolled emotion → Cheese-mediated discipline"

# CHEESE AS TELL MEDIUM

  observation: |
    The cheese board has become a parallel
    communication channel.
    
    Cheese actions now carry as much information
    as chip actions.
    
    This was NOT planned. It emerged.

# OUTCOME ATTRIBUTION

outcome_analysis:
  hand_9:
    winner: don
    tell_contribution: "T9-03 (cheese knife) — missed, cost Donna"
    
  hand_10:
    winner: donna
    tell_contribution: "T10-01 (calm nibble) — Palm read it but called anyway"
    
  hand_11:
    winner: palm
    tell_contribution: |
      T11-01 (cheese put down) — saved Donna and Don chips
      T11-04 (graceful loss) — transcends outcome, defines character
      
  session_theme: |
    Tells have evolved from "reading weakness/strength"
    to "reading emotional state and character growth."
    
    The table is now reading each other's SOULS
    through cheese.
