## The Cheese Ceremony

Don stands up. The table falls quiet.

He walks to the sideboard. Returns with an ENORMOUS wheel of sharp cheddar cheese. The kind that costs more than most people's monthly rent.

"Alright. Since SOMEONE—" he glances at Palm "—keeps mentioning my procurement methods..."

He produces a cheese knife with a flourish.

"Everyone gets cheese. On me. The smuggler provides."

Actually grins.

---

Palm's whiskers twitch. An actual smile?

"The smuggler provides indeed."

Accepts a generous wedge.

"This is excellent cheese."

---

Donna opens her mouth to protest. Closes it. Takes cheese.

"...it IS good cheese."

*Grudging admission. But genuine.*

---

Bumblewick's eyes go wide.

"Is this the SMUGGLED cheese?"

Reverent whisper.

Takes a HUGE wedge.

"It's like... forbidden cheese?"

Munches happily.

*The smell of tension dissolving into dairy.*

---

## Hand 9: Don Sets Over Top Pair (While Slicing Cheese)

Don looks at his cards while cutting more cheese.

"Raise to 150. And does anyone want more cheddar?"

*Multitasking.*

---

The flop comes: **5♥ K♦ 3♠**

Don pauses mid-slice.

"Oh. That's nice."

Resumes slicing.

"I'll bet. 200."

*Too casual?*

---

Donna: "I have a king. Raise. 500."

---

Don: "Interesting."

Cuts another wedge.

"Call."

Offers cheese to Donna.

---

*The turn bricks. The river bricks.*

Don flips his cards.

"Set of fives."

Still holding cheese knife.

---

Donna STARES.

"SET? You were SLICING CHEESE with a SET?"

Half-laughing, half-outraged.

"The CHEESE KNIFE. That's your new tell. Cheese knife means set!"

---

Don slides the pot to his side.

"More cheese?"

Genuine warmth.

"The smuggler provides, and the smuggler wins."

---

## Hand 10: Donna's Aces Hold

Donna looks at her cards. **Pocket aces.**

Finally.

"Raise. All in. 350."

Voice controlled.

Reaches for cheese. Nibbles.

*Calm nibble. Real hand energy.*

---

Palm studies her.

"She's nibbling cheese. But she's CALM nibbling."

Counts chips.

"Call."

---

Cards revealed:
- Donna: A♠ A♣
- Palm: 6♦ 6♣

---

Bumblewick: "GO DONNA!"

Cheese in both hands.

"Aces are the BEST!"

---

**Flop**: 9♣ 4♠ J♥

Donna: "Still ahead."

**Turn**: K♦

Donna: "One more. One more card."

**River**: 2♣

---

Donna EXHALES.

"HELD!"

Actually tears up.

"They held. I'm not out."

---

Bumblewick JUMPS UP.

"DONNA WON!"

Cheese flies.

"Oops. Sorry. DONNA WON!"

---

Palm, quietly: "Good hand. I knew the calm nibble meant something."

---

## Hand 11: The Wheel of Fortune

Bumblewick looks at his cards.

**Kings.**

Sets down cheese.

Deep breath.

"Raise. 500."

*Firm voice. Steady hands.*

---

Donna: "He put down the cheese."

Folds.

---

Don: "The cheese knife is on the table."

Folds.

"I'm not fighting that."

---

Palm: "All in." 

150 total. Suited ace. Last stand.

---

Bumblewick: "Call."

Looks at Palm.

"Sorry. I have something."

---

**Cards revealed:**
- Bumblewick: K♦ K♣
- Palm: A♥ 2♥

---

Palm: "Ace-deuce. Hearts. I've been all-in five times tonight."

Fur perfectly still.

---

**Flop**: 7♣ 5♦ 3♠

Palm: "Gutshot. Need a 4 for the wheel."

Bumblewick relaxes slightly. Reaches for cheese. Stops.

"No. Not yet."

---

Donna: "He didn't take cheese."

Nods approvingly.

"He's learning discipline."

---

**Turn**: 4♥

---

Palm's fur RIPPLES.

"A four."

Looks at board.

"A-2-3-4-5."

Whiskers angle forward.

"Wheel."

---

Bumblewick stares at the four.

"What's... what's a wheel?"

Looks at Palm's face.

"Oh no. Is wheel bad for me?"

---

Don, gently: "Bumble... the four made a straight. Ace-two-three-four-five. The wheel."

---

**River**: J♠

*Meaningless.*

---

## The Moment

Palm: "Wheel."

First smile of the NIGHT. Not whisker-twitch. Actual smile.

"The universe remembered."

---

Bumblewick stares at the board.

Long stare.

Deep breath.

...

"Good hand, Palm."

**No tears.**

Picks up cheese.

"I had kings. I played them right. You got lucky."

Nibbles.

"That's poker."

---

*The table goes silent.*

---

Don: "Bumblewick."

Genuine respect.

"THAT is how you handle a bad beat."

Cuts him extra cheese.

"The biggest wedge for the best loser."

---

Donna has actual tears.

"He didn't cry. HE didn't cry."

Proud.

"I didn't teach him that."

Looks at Don.

"You taught him that."

---

## The Lesson

*The grotto settles into something rare. A table that started with fear and leverage has become... family.*

Don cuts cheese for everyone. Again.

"To poker," he says. "To variance. To learning."

Bumblewick raises his wedge.

"To cheese. And to not crying when you lose with kings."

Palm's whiskers twitch.

"To the wheel. Which comes around."

Donna reaches for her cheese.

"To Bumblewick. Who grew up tonight."

They nibble in silence. Content.

---

**New Tells Established:**
- Cheese knife = confident/set

**Character Arc Completed:**  
Bumblewick: Terror → Learning → Teaching → Graceful Loss
