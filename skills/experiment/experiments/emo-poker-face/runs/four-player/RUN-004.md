# Four-Player Run 004: The Cheese Smuggler Runs Hot

*Gezelligheid Grotto, getting late. The sharp cheddar cheese board is half empty. The chips are moving.*

*Continues from: [four-player-003.md](four-player-003.md)*

---

## The Setup

Four players remain. Donna has leverage. Palm has patience. Don has luck. Bumblewick has... growth.

*The smell of aged dairy and possibility.*

---

## Hand 6: The Short Stacks

Palm looks at their cards. Ace-king suited.

*Fur ripples. Just once.*

"Raise. Two hundred."

Too calm. The kind of calm that comes from 122 years of watching.

---

Bumblewick glances at his cards. Seven-two.

"Fold."

No hesitation. No regret. He *knows* this hand now.

*The smell of learning.*

---

Donna counts Palm's stack. 575. Short.

"Call."

*If I hit, I can knock them out.*

---

Don's fingers tap his stack. Twice. Left-right, left-right.

He looks at Palm. Long look.

"Raise. All in. Seven twenty-five."

Pushes everything forward. Reaches for the sharp cheddar cheese. Doesn't cut a slice.

*The untouched cheese tell. He has something real.*

---

Palm calls the remaining chips.

"I believe this is the moment."

Fur completely still.

---

Cards revealed:
- **Don**: A♥ Q♦
- **Palm**: A♠ K♠

*Palm is ahead. 70-30.*

---

## The Board

**Flop**: K♦ 8♣ 3♠

Palm's fur shimmers. Top pair, top kicker.

"That helps."

*Understatement of the evening.*

---

Don cuts a thin slice of sharp cheddar cheese. Eats it slowly.

"Queen. I need a queen."

*The smell of hope. And dairy.*

---

**Turn**: Q♠

Don SLAPS the table.

"YES!"

Actually stands up.

"Queen of spades, you beautiful thing!"

---

Palm's fur flattens. Completely.

"Ah."

*One syllable. 122 years of equanimity in a single breath.*

---

**River**: 2♥

*Meaningless.*

Don pulls the pot toward himself.

"Sorry, old friend."

Actually sounds sorry.

---

## Palm's Rebuy

Don slides 500 chips across.

"Again, my friend?"

Palm accepts.

"The cheese smuggler is generous."

*Whiskers twitch. Was that... humor?*

---

Donna's eyes narrow.

"Cheese smuggler?"

*Sharp. Protective.*

---

Don waves dismissively.

"Old joke. Don't worry about it."

But he catches Palm's eye. *Warning.*

---

Bumblewick shrugs.

"I don't understand the joke. But yay Palm is back!"

*The smell of innocence. Still somehow intact.*

---

## Hand 7: Bumblewick's Aces (Again)

Bumblewick looks at his cards.

Looks again.

Mouth opens. Closes.

**Pocket aces.**

---

Deep breath.

"I'll... raise. Three hundred."

Voice only slightly wobbly.

*Progress.*

---

Donna studies him.

"You're not shaking."

Observation, not question.

"Call."

---

**Flop**: A♣ 7♠ 4♦

Bumblewick stares at the ace.

Long stare.

"Check."

*Firm voice. No trembling.*

---

Everyone checks behind.

---

**Turn**: J♦

Bumblewick: "Check."

Same tone. Same posture.

*The trap is set.*

---

Don bets 200.

Bumblewick: "Raise. Six hundred."

Hands steady. Eyes on Don.

---

Donna folds. Nods at Bumblewick.

*Respectful nod.*

---

Don studies Bumblewick.

"You have the ace."

Not a question.

"Too rich for jacks."

Folds.

"Well played, little one."

*First time saying it with respect.*

---

Bumblewick turns over his aces.

"I had aces."

Simple statement. No celebration. No tears.

"Donna showed me the trap."

---

## Hand 8: The Running of the Hot

Donna looks at kings.

"Raise. Five hundred."

Sits perfectly still.

*Learned from her slowplay.*

---

Don counts his stack. 550 total.

"I'm all in."

Ten-nine suited. Too short to fold.

---

Palm: "All in as well."

Ace-five suited. 175 chips. Calling regardless.

---

Bumblewick folds eight-six.

"I have chips to protect."

*Growth.*

---

**Cards revealed:**
- Donna: K♥ K♦
- Don: 10♣ 9♣  
- Palm: A♣ 5♣

---

**Flop**: 10♥ 5♦ 2♣

Don: "TEN! Pair of tens!"

Still behind. Kings rule.

---

**Turn**: 10♦

Don JUMPS UP.

"THREE TENS!"

Actual dancing.

---

Donna closes her eyes.

Deep breath.

"Of course."

Opens eyes. Nods at Don.

"Good hand."

*The smell of variance. Bitter. Necessary.*

---

Palm's fur goes completely flat.

"Well. Don runs hot tonight."

---

Bumblewick looks at Donna sympathetically.

"That's poker?"

*Learning the phrase.*

---

## Palm's Second Rebuy

Palm sits very still.

"This session has been... educational."

Looks at Don.

"You run quite hot, cheese smuggler."

---

Don winces.

Slides 500 more to Palm.

"Third time's the charm?"

*Actually looks guilty.*

---

Donna's eyes narrow again.

"You *keep* saying cheese smuggler."

*The smell of jealousy. Over leverage.*

---

Bumblewick tilts his head.

"Is cheese smuggler bad?"

Pause.

"It sounds funny."

Giggles.

"Cheese smuggler."

---

## Final Stacks (After Hand 8)

```
bumblewick: 3750 🪙 (chip leader, teaching others)
don:        825 🪙 (running hot, feeling guilty)

```

---

## The Lesson

*The grotto settles into late-night energy.*

Don cuts sharp cheddar cheese for everyone. Even Palm, who accepts it with an unreadable expression.

"Poker rewards the patient," Palm says. "Sometimes."

"And the lucky," Donna adds. Edge in her voice.

"And the learners," Bumblewick offers. Quietly.

Everyone looks at him.

"What? Donna taught me the trap. I used it. That's learning."

Don raises his cheese.

"To learning. And to luck. And to whatever Palm keeps calling me."

Palm's whiskers twitch.

"To the cheese smuggler."

Donna makes a strangled noise.

*"I don't understand the joke. But yay Palm is back!"*  
— Bumblewick, the only innocent one left
