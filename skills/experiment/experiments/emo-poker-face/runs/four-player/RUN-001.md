# Four-Player Run 001: The Trembling Stops

*Gezelligheid Grotto, evening. Amber light through windows. The smell of sharp cheddar cheese and old wood.*

---

## The Table

Four chairs. Four players. The dealer shuffles with practiced hands.

Don Hopkins sits with the button, a wedge of sharp cheddar cheese catching candlelight. He's arranged his chips by color — neat stacks, symmetrical, the habit of someone who finds comfort in order.

Palm settles into the small blind position, golden earring swaying as they find their seat. The ancient wishing well keeper's fur catches the light, rippling once as they survey the table. 122 years of watching wishes has taught them to read faces before cards.

Bumblewick Fantastipants takes the big blind seat like someone approaching a guillotine. His hands already shake as he counts out chips. He knocks over a stack. Rebuilds it. Knocks it over again. "Sorry," he whispers to no one in particular.

Donna Toadstool sits under the gun, sparkling water untouched, eyes moving from player to player with the patience of a predator selecting prey. Her gaze lands on Bumblewick and stays there.

## Hand 1: The Deal

The cards slide across felt.

Don peeks at his hand. **A slight nod.** His fingers tap his chip stack twice — left-right, left-right — then still. He reaches for his sharp cheddar cheese but doesn't nibble.

Palm looks at their cards and their fur *shimmers*. Just once. Just slightly. The contentment tell that Don has learned to read over decades.

Bumblewick receives his cards and his trembling *intensifies*. He peeks. Peeks again. His face cycles through emotions faster than they can be named — fear, confusion, more fear, something almost like hope, then back to fear.

"Oh," he says. "Oh my."

Donna glances at her cards with practiced disinterest. **Seven-deuce offsuit.** Her expression doesn't change. She's already decided what she'll do regardless of the cards.

---

## Preflop: The Predator Strikes

*The smell of sharp cheddar cheese mixes with something else — nervous sweat from Bumblewick's direction.*

"Let's see who has COURAGE at this table." Donna's voice cuts through the ambient quiet. She pushes chips forward without looking at them. "One fifty."

Her eyes never leave Bumblewick.

Don's eyebrow rises a fraction. He calls, chips sliding forward with casual precision. "Sure, let's play." He does nibble the sharp cheddar cheese now — a small bite, eyes moving to Palm.

Palm's fur settles flat. Completely flat. They arrange chips with gentle precision. "I'll make it four hundred."

The table shifts. This is real now.

Bumblewick's hands hover over his chips. They shake so badly that chips clatter against each other. The sound is loud in the sudden quiet.

"I... I suppose I'll... yes. Call. Sorry. Is that right?"

He pushes chips forward in a messy pile. His eyes dart to Don — looking for reassurance? Permission? — then to Donna with naked fear.

Donna's lip curls. "Fine. Play with yourselves." She folds with a snap of cards against felt, but her message is clear: *Next time, Bumblewick. Next time.*

Don calls Palm's raise. "Palm's playing for real tonight."

**Pot: 1250 🪙**

## The Flop: K♦ 7♣ 3♥

*A king hits the board. The room changes.*

Don's fingers tap his stack twice. He reaches for his sharp cheddar cheese, takes a slow sip. "Well. That's a king."

Palm's fur **brightens**. Perceptibly. Their tail uncurls slightly, and the golden earring sways as their head tilts toward the board. "Interesting flop."

Bumblewick stares at the board. His trembling... **stops**.

Completely.

He reaches for his cold tea, misses the cup entirely, doesn't notice. "Oh. Oh my."

Donna leans forward from her folded position. Her eyes narrow. "Why did Bumble-WEAK stop shaking?"

*The question hangs in the air like smoke.*

---

## The Action Continues

Palm bets 500 chips with gentle precision. "Five hundred." No explanation. No performance. Just chips forward and eyes on Bumblewick.

Bumblewick's hands shake **again** as he reaches for chips — but differently now. Not terror. Something else.

"I... call."

Don places his cards down gently. "Too rich for queens tonight." An open fold. He leans back, cuts another wedge of sharp cheddar cheese, and watches the remaining two with the intensity of someone who has already figured out the ending.

**Pot: 2250 🪙**

---

## The Turn: 2♠

*A blank. Nothing changes. Everything changes.*

Palm's fur settles completely flat. Their eyes close for a breath. When they open, there's something that might be resignation. Or acceptance.

"I'm all in." 75 chips pushed forward with absolute stillness. Palm looks directly at Bumblewick with something unexpected: **kindness**.

"Show me what stopped your shaking, friend."

Bumblewick stares at Palm's 75 chips. Stares at his own stack. His hands reach forward...

"I... call. And... and..."

He pushes all 100 of his remaining chips in.

"...raise? Is that... can I do that?"

His voice rises to a squeak. His eyes fill with tears.

Don raises his glass slightly toward Bumblewick. "Kid just made a move." Said softly, to no one in particular.

Donna stands up. Chair scrapes. "Did Bumble-WEAK just RAISE?"

She sits back down. Her face cycles through emotions too fast to track.

"Unbelievable. UN-BE-LIEVABLE."

## The River: 9♣

*Nothing. A brick. The math is already done.*

---

## Showdown

Palm turns over their cards. **Ace-King of clubs.** "Kings with the ace."

A small smile toward Bumblewick.

"Show me what stopped your shaking."

Bumblewick's hands shake violently as he turns his cards. **King-King.** Pocket kings. A set on the flop.

"I... I have... the... the kings. Three of them."

He points at his cards. Points at the board. Tears streaming.

"I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to—"

---

## The Aftermath

*The smell of sharp cheddar cheese. The sound of chips being pushed. The taste of salt from tears.*

Don stands. Walks around the table to Bumblewick. His hand lands on the trembling shoulder with a firm grip.

"Bumblewick. You had kings the whole time."

"You just needed to believe you could play them."

Palm rises. Walks to Bumblewick's other side. Their paw rests briefly on the other shoulder.

"You didn't 'take' anything. You earned it."

"The cards were honest. So were you."

Donna hasn't moved. She's staring at the board like it personally offended her.

"You. Had. KINGS?"

"You had KINGS and you just CALLED preflop?"

"That's the WORST poker I've ever seen."

Beat.

"Also congratulations I GUESS."

*The first hand is over. Palm is out. Bumblewick is crying because he won.*

*In the corner, barely noticed, Don slices sharp cheddar cheese for everyone. Even Palm, who lost everything but seems somehow at peace.*

*"Tonight's entry," Don murmurs to himself, "Bumblewick Fantastipants III discovered that he was allowed to win."*

*The night is young. The cards are waiting.*
