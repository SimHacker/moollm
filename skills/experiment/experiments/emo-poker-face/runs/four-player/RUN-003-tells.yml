# ABSENCE TELLS (NEW CATEGORY)

absence_tells:
  definition: "When a signature tell DOESN'T appear"
  examples:
    - tell: "Donna doesn't stand up"
      meaning: "Real hand (stands for bluffs, sits for value)"
      stronger_than: "Any positive tell"
      
  why_powerful: |
    Absence of expected behavior carries MORE information
    than presence of unexpected behavior.
    
    Don saw Donna NOT stand. That told him everything.

# CROSS-CHARACTER LEARNING

learning_transfer:
  from: bumblewick (hand 1)
  to: donna (hand 5)
  pattern: "Check-check-shove with monster"
  recognition: "Bumblewick named it: 'The quiet thing!'"
  
  implication: |
    Characters are watching each other's strategies
    and adopting what works.
    
    The table is becoming a learning system.

# DONNA'S TELL EVOLUTION

donna_arc:
  before_pardon:
    signature_tells:
      - "Stands up for big raises"
      - "Stares at targets"
      - "Voice raised, theatrical"
    readable_by: "Everyone"
    
  after_pardon:
    new_tells:
      - "Water glass ritual (composure)"
      - "Controlled silence"
      - "Identical tone/posture (trap)"
    readable_by: "Palm, Don (learned readers)"
    
  evolution: |
    Donna's tells went from LOUD to SUBTLE.
    From theatrical to controlled.
    
    She didn't eliminate tells — she changed them.
    Now only the experienced can read her.

# OUTCOME ATTRIBUTION

outcome_analysis:
  winner: donna
  primary_reason: "Superior hand (set of queens)"
  
  tell_contribution:
    - "T5-04 (no standing): Saved Don from calling"
    - "T5-07 (quiet check): Induced Bumblewick bet"
    - "T5-12 (OH moment): Let Bumblewick escape cheaply"
    
  counterfactual: |
    If Donna had stood up to raise (old behavior):
    - Don might have called (reading it as bluff)
    - Pot would have been larger
    - But Don would have lost more
    
    The NEW Donna won less but signaled growth.
    The pardon bought a different player.
