        575 chips. This is my hand.

        Reaches for sharp cheddar cheese. Doesn't cut a slice.
      thinking: |
        Ace-queen. Palm raised from UTG with 575.
        They have something. I have something.

        I have ace-king.

        But if Palm wins, Palm is dangerous again.

        Weak Palm = one less competitor.

    # Money in pot: 25 + 50 + 200 + 675 + 525 = 1475?

    # Pot: 200 + 725 + 575 = 1500
    # Don wins 1500. Don had 0 after all-in, gets 1500.
    # Wait no. Don went all-in for 725. Palm called 575 (less than don's 725).
    # So main pot is 575 + 575 + 200 (donna's dead) = 1350
    # Side pot is 725 - 575 = 150 back to Don
    # Palm can only win 575 × 2 + 200 = 1350
    # Don wins 1350 + gets 150 back = 1500? But he put in 725, gets 1500, profit 775.

        "I had aces."
        Simple statement.
        No celebration. No tears.
        "Donna showed me the trap."
      thinking: |
        I won.
        I played it perfectly.
        Donna taught me this.
        I should say thank you.

        Learned from her slowplay.
      thinking: |
        KINGS.
        After watching Bumblewick trap with aces...
        Maybe I should trap too?
        No. I'm not Bumblewick.
        I bet my good hands now.
        Different player, different style.

        Let's gamble.

        175 chips.
        I'm calling regardless.
        Might as well look aggressive.

        Simple.

        Eight-six suited.
        Two people all-in.
        I have chips to protect.

        "Good hand."
      thinking: |
        Two outer.
        He had 4% and hit.
        This is poker.
        At least I'm not eliminated.
        
    palm:

        Fur completely flat.
        "Don runs hot tonight."
      thinking: |
        I'm drawing dead to the side pot.
        Just need to dodge Don for main pot.
        But Don has trips.
        I need runner-runner aces or fives.
        This is over.
        
    bumblewick:

        "Oh! Don hit again!"
        Looks at Donna sympathetically.
        "That's poker?"
        Learning the phrase.
      thinking: |
        Don got lucky twice in a row.
        Donna got unlucky.
        Is that fair?
        I don't think poker is about fair.

        "You run quite hot, cheese smuggler."
      thinking: |
        Twice now. Both times all-in good.
        Both times sucked out on.
        This is variance.
        122 years of watching tells me:
        Variance is temporary.
        Skill is forever.
        Don will give those chips back.
        
    don:

        I keep sucking out on Palm.
        The universe owes them.

        Palm is USING it.
        That's MY leverage!
        
    bumblewick:
      observable: |
        "Is cheese smuggler bad?"
        Genuine confusion.
      thinking: |
        Everyone keeps saying it.
        It sounds funny.
        Cheese smuggler.
        Hehe.
