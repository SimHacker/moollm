# CHEESE SMUGGLER TELL EVOLUTION

cheese_smuggler_dynamic:
  first_use:
    who: palm
    when: "Rebuy 1"
    context: "Accepting Don's stake"
    
  effect_on_donna:
    initial: "Sharp look — 'Cheese smuggler?'"
    escalation: "'You KEEP saying cheese smuggler'"
    meaning: "Leverage anxiety"
    
  effect_on_don:
    initial: "Warning look to Palm"
    later: "Winces, actually looks guilty"
    meaning: "Secret becoming shared knowledge"
    
  bumblewick_response:
    confusion: '"Is cheese smuggler bad?"'
    resolution: '"It sounds funny. Hehe."'
    meaning: "Comic innocence preserves table lightness"
    
  analysis: |
    Palm weaponized information without revealing details.
    Just saying "cheese smuggler" accomplishes:
    1. Reminds Don that Palm knows
    2. Makes Donna anxious about losing exclusive leverage
    3. Creates ongoing social tension
    4. Bumblewick's innocence defuses the tension
    
    Information is currency. Palm is spending it slowly.

    When variance is extreme, tells don't matter.
    But social tells (cheese smuggler) matter more.
    The game within the game.
