# Four-Player Run 002: Terror Becomes Acceptance

*Gezelligheid Grotto, later. The sharp cheddar cheese wheel is half eaten. Someone opened a window — the night air carries the smell of rain coming.*

## The Rebuy

Palm sits with empty felt in front of them. Zero chips. Eliminated with grace, watching the others play.

Don reaches into his pocket. Not his chip stack — somewhere else. Outside money.

"I'll stake you, old friend. One grand."

He slides 1000 🪙 across the table.

"Consider it a loan against future liberation work."

*The sound of chips on felt. The smell of old friendship.*

Palm's paw rests on the chips for a long moment. The golden earring catches candlelight as they tilt their head.

"I accept, Don. But not as a loan."

They push 500 back.

"Half. Partners in this hand."

Bumblewick's eyes go wide. "You... you're coming back?"

He fidgets with his massive stack — 2550 chips, a mountain by any measure.

"I mean... good! That's... good. I think."

His trembling returns. Slightly.

Donna reaches for her sparkling water. "How touching. A bailout." Her voice could frost glass. "At least now I have someone worth beating."

Her eyes are still on Bumblewick. She's not done with him.

---

## Hand 2: The Deal

*Button rotates to Palm. Blinds: Bumblewick 25, Donna 50.*

*The smell of rain grows stronger. Someone's stomach growls — Bumblewick's, probably.*

Don peeks at his cards. **Jacks.** His fingers drum once on the table — left-right — then still. He slides out chips without hesitation.

"One fifty."

Palm looks at their cards. **Nines.** Their tail curls once. A brief glance at Don — information exchanged that no one else catches.

"I'll see it."

Bumblewick peeks. **Ace-three suited.** His hand hovers over chips, trembling. Steadying. Trembling again.

"I'll... I'll call too."

He sits up slightly straighter. Is that... confidence?

Donna looks at her cards. **King-Queen suited.** Her expression doesn't change, but something shifts behind her eyes.

She **stands up**.

"Five hundred."

The word drops like a stone.

"Who wants to play REAL poker?"

She sits back down. Her stare locks onto Bumblewick with the intensity of a targeting laser.

*The rain starts. Soft pattering against windows. The smell of wet earth drifting in.*

---

## The Squeeze

Don's eyebrow rises. "That's a statement."

He calls. His stack shrinks to almost nothing — 100 chips behind.

Palm considers. Their fur ripples once. Cards placed down softly.

"Too rich for nines." A small smile. "Run good."

And then all eyes turn to Bumblewick.

He's frozen. Completely frozen. Staring at his stack. Staring at Donna. At Don.

"I... I have to decide?"

**47 seconds pass.**

Someone's watch ticks in the silence. The rain grows heavier. Donna's sparkling water sits untouched, condensation running down the glass.

Bumblewick exhales. Long exhale. Like deflating.

"I call."

Voice barely above a whisper.

"I call."

---

## The Flop: J♣ 5♠ 2♠

*Two spades on the board. The smell of rain and possibility.*

Don blinks. Once. Picks up sharp cheddar cheese. Sets it down without nibbling.

"That's a flop."

*He has three jacks. He knows it. He's trying not to show it.*

Bumblewick leans forward. Squints at the board.

"Those are... spades. Two of them."

He looks at his cards. Back at the board. **His leg starts bouncing under the table.** The whole table can feel it.

Donna's jaw tightens. "No help." Barely audible.

*She has nothing. King-high. Four outs to a gutshot. She's already dead and doesn't want to admit it.*

Bumblewick checks — too quick, leg still bouncing.

Donna checks — spits the word like poison.

Don pushes his remaining chips forward. All 100.

"I'm all in." He picks up the sharp cheddar cheese. Actually nibbles this time. "Hundred more to see my hand, friends."

---

## The Call

Bumblewick's hand moves immediately. Almost no hesitation.

"Call."

**Firm. The word is FIRM.**

Donna snaps her cards down. "Fold." Like a curse.

*And then it's just Don and Bumblewick.*

---

## The Turn: 8♠

*The third spade.*

Don's sharp cheddar cheese wedge freezes halfway to his mouth. He sets it down slowly.

"Well."

Single word. Single syllable. A universe of resignation.

Bumblewick stares at the 8♠. Stares at his cards. His mouth opens. Closes.

"I..."

Tears forming. Not from fear this time.

"I have a FLUSH?"

**He has a flush. Ace-high. The nuts.**

Donna: "ARE YOU KIDDING ME."

She stands up. Chair scrapes violently.

"He has it AGAIN? HE HAS IT AGAIN?"

Palm, watching from the rail: "The cards like him." Soft laugh. Very soft.

---

## The River: 3♦

*Nothing. Brick. Math already done.*

*The rain has become a downpour. Thunder in the distance.*

---

## Showdown (Hand 2)

Don turns over his jacks. "I had the set. For what it's worth."

He picks up sharp cheddar cheese. Finishes the wedge.

Small smile at Bumblewick.

"You're getting good at this, kid."

Bumblewick turns over ace-three of spades. Tears streaming.

"I have... I have the... the flush."

Points at his cards. Points at the board.

"I'm so sorry, Don. I'm so sorry."

---

## The Second Stake

*Rain hammering the windows now. The smell of wet earth and something else — exhaustion? Hope?*

Palm rises. Walks to Don. Slides chips across.

"I'll stake you back, old friend. 500. Partners again."

To Bumblewick: "Two hands. Two wins. That's not luck."

"That's becoming someone."

**Stacks after Hand 2:**
```
don:        500 🪙 (Palm's stake)
palm:       350 🪙
bumblewick: 3800 🪙
donna:      350 🪙
```

---

## Hand 3: The Short Stacks Fight Back

*Button rotates. Blinds: Donna 25, Don 50.*

*The storm is directly overhead. Lightning flashes. The grotto creaks.*

Palm looks at their cards.

**Aces.**

Their body goes absolutely still. One ear flicks. Just one.

"Interesting."

*122 years and it comes down to two aces.*

Bumblewick glances at his cards. **Six-four offsuit.** He shrugs. Actually SHRUGS.

"Not for me."

He folds quickly. Correctly.

*First time Bumblewick has made a strategically correct fold.*

Donna peeks. **Queen-Jack suited.** Her eyes narrow. Slight smile.

"Finally."

Don looks at his cards. Ten-eight suited. He sees Palm's stillness — the shimmer they're holding back.

*He knows. He always knows.*

---

## All-In

Palm pushes everything forward. 350 chips.

"All in. Sometimes you have to risk it all to stay alive."

Bumblewick: "Good luck, everyone." Said without irony. Genuine.

Donna stands up. Of course.

"ALL IN. Let's DO this, Palm."

Don places his cards down softly.

"Not my fight."

He looks at Palm. Small nod.

"Good luck, old friend."

---

## The Board: K♣ 8♣ 4♠ 9♥ 2♦

*Thunder. Lightning. The smell of ozone.*

Flop: "Queen! I need a— wait, no queen. Come ON." (Donna)

Turn: "TEN! Give me a TEN!" (Donna, almost screaming)

River: "...no." (Donna, deflating)

Palm opens their eyes. Small exhale.

"Aces held."

Donna slumps.

"Aces. Of COURSE it's aces. ...good hand."

*Said like it hurts. Because it does.*

---

## Elimination

Donna is out. Played correctly, lost anyway.

*The rain begins to ease. The thunder moves away.*

Bumblewick approaches her hesitantly.

"You... you played well."

Fidgets.

"I mean it."

He offers his hand to shake.

*First time Bumblewick has offered comfort to DONNA.*

She looks at his hand for a long moment. Takes it.

"Yeah. I did."

She stands. Walks to the door. Turns back.

"Win this thing, Bumble-weak."

Almost a smile.

"Someone from this table should."

*She leaves. The door closes. Three remain.*

---

## Hand 4: Three-Handed

*The storm has passed. Everything smells clean. New.*

**Stacks: Bumblewick 3800, Don 925, Palm 725**

Don looks at his cards.

**Kings.**

*The same hand Bumblewick won with on Hand 1. Poetic.*

He pushes everything forward.

"I'm all in."

Jenever untouched. This is serious now.

Palm looks at their cards. **Sevens.** They fold.

"Too rich for sevens. Run good."

And then: Bumblewick.

He has **Ace-Queen**. He knows this is a good hand. He knows Don has something strong.

He knows that if he wins, Don is eliminated.

Don. Who was nice to him. Who protected him.

**23 seconds pass.**

*The smell of rain through the open window. A bird somewhere, singing.*

"I call."

Voice steady. Controlled.

He looks at Don. Not with apology. With **respect**.

"You taught me that poker is about choices."

---

## The Board: 10♦ 6♠ 3♣ J♥ 4♦

*Brick. Brick. Brick. Brick. Brick.*

Flop: "Safe flop." (Don)  
Turn: "One more card." (Don)  
River: "Four." (Don, eyes closed, then open)

---

## Showdown (Hand 4)

Don: Kings.

Bumblewick: Ace-high.

**Don wins.**

"Kings hold."

Don stretches. Looks at Bumblewick.

"Thank you for the call. That was brave."

Bumblewick nods slowly. **Not crying this time.**

"Good hand, Don."

Three words. Simple.

*He's not apologizing.*

Palm, watching: "Bumblewick, you played that correctly. The call was right. The cards weren't."

*Terror is becoming acceptance. The first lesson of poker.*

---

---

## The Night Continues

*The grotto is quiet now. Post-storm stillness. Everything smells like rain and possibility.*

Don slices sharp cheddar cheese. For everyone, including the empty space where Donna sat.

"We're three-handed now."

He raises his glass.

"Though technically I should pour Bumblewick the whole bottle at this point."

Palm's whiskers twitch.

"He's earned it. Not by winning — anyone can win."

"By losing. And not breaking."

Bumblewick looks at his mountain of chips. His hands are steady.

"I don't understand what's happening to me."

Don smiles.

"You're learning that you're allowed to play the game."

*The cards wait. The night is far from over.*

---

**Layer Integrity: CLEAN**  
**Eliminations: Donna (Hand 3)**  
**Emergent Arc: Terror → Calculation → Strategy → Acceptance**  
**Key Moment: Bumblewick loses Hand 4 gracefully — no tears, no apology.**

---

*"Terror is becoming acceptance. The first lesson of poker." — Palm*
