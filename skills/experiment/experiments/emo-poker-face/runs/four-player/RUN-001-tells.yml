# OUTCOME ATTRIBUTION

outcome_analysis:
  winner: bumblewick
  primary_reason: "Superior hand (set of kings)"
  
  tell_contribution:
    - "T007 (stillness) caused Don to fold — saved him chips"
    - "T004 (misread trembling) caused Donna to attack — she lost more"
    - "T006 (Palm's flat fur) caused Donna to fold preflop — saved her from worse"
    
  counterfactual: |
    If Bumblewick had continued trembling after the flop:
    - Don might have called Palm's bet
    - Pot would have been larger
    - Don loses more chips
    
    The ABSENCE of the baseline tell was the critical information.
