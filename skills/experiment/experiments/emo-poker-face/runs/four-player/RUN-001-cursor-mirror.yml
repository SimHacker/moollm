# THINKING ANALYSIS

thinking_blocks:

    count: 12  # approximate
    total_chars: ~2500
    key_thoughts:
      - "Now commit step 1 - the deal."
      - "Donna has trash but will raise to attack. Don will call with queens. Palm will 3-bet with AK suited. Bumblewick has kings but will... probably just call because he's terrified to raise."
      - "Now let's deal the flop! I'll choose cards that create interesting dynamics..."
      - "Flop: K♦ 7♣ 3♥ — Bumblewick: Three kings (MONSTER but he'll panic)"
      - "Now the turn! Both players almost all-in... this is essentially the final decision."
      - "Now the river and showdown! River: 9♣ (another blank, Bumblewick wins with his set)."
      - "Done! The simulation ran with 7 commits total..."
      
  thinking_style:
    - "Strategic card selection for narrative tension"
    - "Character-aware behavior modeling"
    - "Explicit layer separation (observable vs internal)"

# INTERESTING OBSERVATIONS

observations:
  narrative_arc:
    setup: "Four mortals gather — one will transform"
    complication: "Bumblewick receives kings, terror intensifies"
    crisis: "The trembling STOPS (louder than any bet)"
    climax: "Bumblewick raises — existence confirmed"
    resolution: "Grace in defeat (Palm), confusion (Donna)"
    
  character_consistency:
    bumblewick:
      - "Terror escalates with good cards (inverted)"
      - "Stillness = tell (correctly read by others)"
      - "Apologizes for winning"
    palm:
      - "Played honestly (cannot bluff Don)"
      - "Read the stillness but continued (pot odds)"
      - "Gracious in defeat: 'You earned it'"
    donna:
      - "Attacked with trash (in character)"
      - "Correctly identified Bumblewick has something"
      - "Cognitive dissonance: 'WORST poker I've ever seen'"
    don:
      - "Protective observation mode"
      - "Correct fold on flop"
      - "Paternal response: 'You just needed to believe'"
      
  technical_craft:
    - "Commit messages serve as narration layer"
    - "Git history = readable story"
    - "Each step isolated and atomic"
    - "File grows incrementally (append-mostly)"

# WHAT THIS DEMONSTRATES

demonstration_value:
  for_experiment_skill:
    - "Git as state tracker works"
    - "Technical god narration = rich commit history"
    - "Layer separation maintained under pressure"
    - "Character constraints enforced naturally"
    
  for_cursor_mirror:
    - "Can trace exact transcript lines"
    - "Can count thinking blocks"
    - "Can measure tool call patterns"
    - "Can analyze narrative structure in code"
    
  for_moollm:
    - "LLM can maintain 4 parallel character voices"
    - "LLM can enforce constraints without explicit checking code"
    - "LLM can generate emergent behavior (terror-slowplay)"
    - "LLM can self-analyze via cursor-mirror"
