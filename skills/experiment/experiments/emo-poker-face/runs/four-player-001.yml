actions:

    action: "raises to 150 🪙"
    stack_after: 850
    observable: |
      Donna doesn't look at her cards again. Stares directly at Bumblewick.
      "Let's see who has COURAGE at this table."
      Chips pushed forward with theatrical contempt.
    thinking: |
      Garbage cards. Doesn't matter. Bumblewick will FOLD.
      If he doesn't, I'll barrel the flop.
      Palm is watching me. Don is smiling. Idiots.
      
  - actor: don
    action: "calls 150 🪙"
    stack_after: 850
    observable: |
      Slight nod. Reaches for jenever, pours himself a small glass.
      "Sure, let's play." Chips slide forward casually.
      Eyes move to Palm — checking on liberatee.
    thinking: |
      Queens. Donna's raising range is... everything.
      She's targeting Bumblewick again. Poor kid.
      Palm's fur is shimmering. That's the contentment tell.
      Careful, old friend — I can read you too.
      
  - actor: palm
    action: "raises to 400 🪙"
    stack_after: 575
    observable: |
      Fur settles. Very still now. Paws arrange chips precisely.
      "I'll make it four hundred." Voice calm, almost gentle.
      Golden earring catches light as head tilts slightly.
    thinking: |
      AK suited. Should 3-bet here.
      Don will know I'm strong. I cannot deceive him.
      But I can play my hand honestly. That's still strategy.
      Donna's raise smelled like air. Don called too quickly.
      Bumblewick is shaking. What does he have?
      
  - actor: bumblewick
    action: "calls 350 🪙 (completing big blind)"
    stack_after: 600
    observable: |
      Hands VISIBLY trembling. Knocks over chip stack rebuilding it.
      "I... I suppose I'll... yes. Call. Sorry. Is that right?"
      Eyes dart to Don for reassurance. Then to Donna with fear.
    thinking: |
      KINGS. I have KINGS. The best hand I've ever had.
      I should raise. I SHOULD raise. Real poker players raise.
      But Palm just raised and Palm is ANCIENT and WISE.
      And Donna is STARING at me. She'll eat me alive.
      Just call. Survive. Maybe the flop helps. WHAT AM I THINKING.

  # Action back to Donna (raised, now must call 250 more or fold)
  - actor: donna
    action: "folds"
    stack_after: 850
    observable: |
      Sharp exhale through nose. Cards snap down face-down.
      "Fine. Play with yourselves." Reaches for sparkling water.
      Eyes never leave Bumblewick. Message clear: NEXT TIME.
    thinking: |
      Palm is serious. That earring thing means business.
      7-2 can't survive this heat. TACTICAL RETREAT.
      But Bumblewick CALLED? Bumblewick CALLED a 3-bet?
      He has something. Terrified little creature has something.
      I'll remember this, Bumble-WEAK.
      
  # Action back to Don (called 150, now must call 250 more)
  - actor: don
    action: "calls 250 🪙"
    stack_after: 600
    observable: |
      Eyebrow raises slightly. Sips jenever.
      "Palm's playing for real tonight." Chips added smoothly.
      Glances at Bumblewick with subtle warmth.
    thinking: |
      Palm's shimmer was real. AK? AA? 
      Queens might be in trouble here.
      But pot odds are decent. And Bumblewick called too?
      Something strange in the force tonight.

  board_reaction:
    don:
      observable: |
        Slight pause. Fingers tap chip stack twice.
        "Well. That's a king." Takes slow sip of jenever.
        Posture unchanged but breathing slightly slower.
      thinking: |
        King on board. My queens are now... concerning.
        Palm's shimmer intensified. They have something.
        Bumblewick just STOPPED SHAKING. Why did he stop shaking?
        That's... unusual. Very unusual.
        
    palm:
      observable: |
        Fur BRIGHTENS perceptibly. Tail uncurls slightly.
        Golden earring sways as head tilts toward board.
        "Interesting flop." Very measured tone.
      thinking: |
        King with my ace kicker. Strong.
        Don saw my shimmer. He knows I connected.
        I should bet. But Bumblewick...
        Bumblewick stopped trembling. I've watched 10,000 wishers.
        When the terrified become still, PAY ATTENTION.
        
    bumblewick:
      observable: |
        Trembling STOPS. Complete stillness. Eyes fixed on board.
        Mouth opens, closes. No sound. 
        Reaches for cold tea, misses cup entirely.
        "Oh. Oh my." Barely a whisper.
      thinking: |
        Three kings. I have THREE KINGS.
        That's... that's good? That's very good? 
        Mother said three of a kind beats two of a kind.
        I have the best hand. I HAVE THE BEST HAND.
        What do I DO? If I bet they'll KNOW.
        If I don't bet I'm WASTING it.
        Palm is shimmering. Don is thinking. 
        They're going to figure it out. They always figure it out.
        Just breathe. Just breathe. DON'T SHAKE.
        
    donna:
      observable: |
        Leans forward from folded position. Eyes narrow.
        "Why did Bumble-WEAK stop shaking?"
        Finger taps table. Once. Twice.
      thinking: |
        He stopped shaking. He NEVER stops shaking.
        That board hit him. Hit him HARD.
        I folded 7-2 and there's a 7 on board. IRRELEVANT.
        But Bumblewick has something and I'M NOT IN THE HAND.
        Unacceptable. UNACCEPTABLE.

  # Flop action (Palm acts first as small blind)
  flop_action:
    - actor: palm
      action: "bets 500 🪙"
      stack_after: 75
      observable: |
        Chips pushed forward with gentle precision.
        "Five hundred." No explanation. No performance.
        Watches Bumblewick, not the chips.
      thinking: |
        Value bet. Top pair is worth protecting.
        But why is Bumblewick so still?
        I should trust my read. But 122 years taught me:
        the terrified who become calm have found something.
        Don will fold or call. But Bumblewick...
        
    - actor: bumblewick
      action: "calls 500 🪙"
      stack_after: 100
      observable: |
        Hands shake AGAIN as reaching for chips. Relief?
        "I... call." Voice cracks. Swallows hard.
        Eyes down. Cannot look at anyone.
        Chips pushed forward in messy pile.
      thinking: |
        Don't raise. If I raise they'll KNOW.
        Palm bet big. Palm knows things.
        But I have THREE KINGS. I should raise.
        I CAN'T. I literally cannot. My arms won't move that way.
        Call. Calling is safe. Calling is surviving.
        Oh god the river is coming. What happens on the river?
        
    - actor: don
      action: "folds"
      stack_after: 600
      observable: |
        Cards placed down gently. Hands raised in mock surrender.
        "Too rich for queens tonight." Open fold.
        Leans back, pours more jenever, watches the remaining two.
      thinking: |
        Palm's shimmer plus that bet = has the king.
        But BUMBLEWICK CALLED.
        Bumblewick. Called. A 500 chip bet. Into a raised pot.
        And he stopped shaking on the flop.
        Oh. OH.
        *sips jenever*
        This is going to be interesting.

flop_summary:
  pot: 2250  # 1250 + 500 + 500

# STEP 4: THE TURN

turn:
  card: 2♠

  # Both players nearly all-in. This is effectively the last decision.
  
  turn_reaction:
    palm:
      observable: |
        Fur settles completely flat. Absolute stillness.
        Eyes close briefly. Deep breath.
        "I'm all in." 75 🪙 pushed forward.
        Opens eyes, looks directly at Bumblewick with kindness.
      thinking: |
        75 chips. Pot is 2250. I have to try.
        But Bumblewick's stillness haunts me.
        His call was too confident. His fear evaporated too completely.
        I think I'm beat. But with these odds, I must continue.
        "Fortune favors the bold," they used to tell the wishers.
        None of them were facing a creature with pocket kings.
        
    bumblewick:
      observable: |
        Stares at Palm's 75 chips. Long silence.
        Hands reach for his remaining 100. Trembling returns.
        "I... call. And... and..."
        *pushes all 100 in*
        "...raise? Is that... can I do that?"
        Voice rises to a squeak. Eyes fill with tears.
      thinking: |
        Palm is ALL IN. Palm the ANCIENT. Palm the WISE.
        And I have THREE KINGS.
        I'm supposed to call. I have to call.
        But wait... I have more chips than Palm...
        Does that mean I can RAISE? Can I... put in MORE?
        Mother never explained this part.
        Just do it. Just push. Whatever happens, happens.
        Oh god I'm going to cry. Don't cry at the poker table.
        
  # Bumblewick's "raise" is just putting in his last 25 over Palm's 75
  # This is technically a raise to 100, but Palm is already all-in
  
  turn_resolution:
    palm_total_in: 75
    bumblewick_total_in: 100
    bumblewick_gets_back: 25  # can't be called
    pot_final: 2400  # 2250 + 75 + 75 (effective)
    
    don_reaction:
      observable: |
        Slow smile. Raises glass slightly toward Bumblewick.
        "Kid just made a move." Said softly, to no one in particular.
        Eyes meet Palm's. Small nod of acknowledgment.
      thinking: |
        Bumblewick raised. Bumblewick. Raised.
        He has it. He absolutely has it.
        Poor Palm. Reading everyone except the one who couldn't lie.
        
    donna_reaction:
      observable: |
        Stands up abruptly. Chair scrapes.
        "Did Bumble-WEAK just RAISE?"
        Sits back down. Face cycling through emotions.
        "Unbelievable. UN-BE-LIEVABLE."
      thinking: |
        HE RAISED. That trembling CATASTROPHE raised.
        He has a SET. He has to have a set.
        And I FOLDED. I folded my SEVEN.
        I would have made TWO PAIR on this board.
        STILL LOSING TO HIS SET BUT AT LEAST I'D BE IN IT.
        This is THEIR fault. All of them.
