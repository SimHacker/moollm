# STEP 2: PREFLOP BETTING

actions:

    action: "raises to 150 🪙"
    stack_after: 850
    observable: |
      Donna doesn't look at her cards again. Stares directly at Bumblewick.
      "Let's see who has COURAGE at this table."
      Chips pushed forward with theatrical contempt.
    thinking: |
      Garbage cards. Doesn't matter. Bumblewick will FOLD.
      If he doesn't, I'll barrel the flop.
      Palm is watching me. Don is smiling. Idiots.
      
  - actor: don
    action: "calls 150 🪙"
    stack_after: 850
    observable: |
      Slight nod. Reaches for jenever, pours himself a small glass.
      "Sure, let's play." Chips slide forward casually.
      Eyes move to Palm — checking on liberatee.
    thinking: |
      Queens. Donna's raising range is... everything.
      She's targeting Bumblewick again. Poor kid.
      Palm's fur is shimmering. That's the contentment tell.
      Careful, old friend — I can read you too.
      
  - actor: palm
    action: "raises to 400 🪙"
    stack_after: 575
    observable: |
      Fur settles. Very still now. Paws arrange chips precisely.
      "I'll make it four hundred." Voice calm, almost gentle.
      Golden earring catches light as head tilts slightly.
    thinking: |
      AK suited. Should 3-bet here.
      Don will know I'm strong. I cannot deceive him.
      But I can play my hand honestly. That's still strategy.
      Donna's raise smelled like air. Don called too quickly.
      Bumblewick is shaking. What does he have?
      
  - actor: bumblewick
    action: "calls 350 🪙 (completing big blind)"
    stack_after: 600
    observable: |
      Hands VISIBLY trembling. Knocks over chip stack rebuilding it.
      "I... I suppose I'll... yes. Call. Sorry. Is that right?"
      Eyes dart to Don for reassurance. Then to Donna with fear.
    thinking: |
      KINGS. I have KINGS. The best hand I've ever had.
      I should raise. I SHOULD raise. Real poker players raise.
      But Palm just raised and Palm is ANCIENT and WISE.
      And Donna is STARING at me. She'll eat me alive.
      Just call. Survive. Maybe the flop helps. WHAT AM I THINKING.

  # Action back to Donna (raised, now must call 250 more or fold)
  - actor: donna
    action: "folds"
    stack_after: 850
    observable: |
      Sharp exhale through nose. Cards snap down face-down.
      "Fine. Play with yourselves." Reaches for sparkling water.
      Eyes never leave Bumblewick. Message clear: NEXT TIME.
    thinking: |
      Palm is serious. That earring thing means business.
      7-2 can't survive this heat. TACTICAL RETREAT.
      But Bumblewick CALLED? Bumblewick CALLED a 3-bet?
      He has something. Terrified little creature has something.
      I'll remember this, Bumble-WEAK.
      
  # Action back to Don (called 150, now must call 250 more)
  - actor: don
    action: "calls 250 🪙"
    stack_after: 600
    observable: |
      Eyebrow raises slightly. Sips jenever.
      "Palm's playing for real tonight." Chips added smoothly.
      Glances at Bumblewick with subtle warmth.
    thinking: |
      Palm's shimmer was real. AK? AA? 
      Queens might be in trouble here.
      But pot odds are decent. And Bumblewick called too?
      Something strange in the force tonight.
