# Eight-Player Run 005 — The Final Stand

*The candles have been replaced three times. The night is old. The stories
are nearly told.*

## Hand 12: The Goblin Stands

Bumblewick looks at Ace-King suited. 775 chips left.

He thinks of everything he's learned tonight:
- Don showed him to play through fear.
- Donna showed him the trap.
- Palm showed him graceful loss.
- Leigh showed him he can win.

"All in."

His voice doesn't shake. His hands don't tremble. His eyes are clear.

Peewee calls with eights. "MATCHING!"

Palm calls with jacks.

The flop: King-Jack-Five. Palm has a set. Bumblewick has top pair.

Turn: Ace. Two pair for Bumblewick.

River: King. *KINGS FULL*.

The table erupts. Bumblewick stands — he's *never* stood during a hand.

"Thank you," he says. "All of you. For teaching me."

Klaus's hands move slightly. It might be applause. No one can be sure.

## Hand 13: Art Finds a Way

The London Triangle makes its final play.

Bowie raises. Klaus calls. Leigh squeezes.

Bowie, Ziggy fully present now, shoves all-in. "Let's dance, darlings."

Klaus calls. Leigh calls. Three-way all-in.

Flop: Ten-Seven-Deuce with two spades. Klaus has set of tens.

Turn: Three. Blank.

River: King of spades. Leigh makes the flush.

"Art always finds a way," Leigh grins.

Klaus's eyes close. Just for a moment. First visible emotion of the night.

Bowie stands, collects what's left of his dignity. "I think that's enough
for me tonight. Well played, all."

He doesn't rebuy. He leaves.

## Hand 14: The Ancient vs The Alien

Final hand. Palm and Klaus.

Palm raises with aces. Klaus three-bets with kings.

"...Six." Klaus's sixth word.

Palm four-bets. Klaus shoves all-in.

"'All.' Seventh word. Final word."

Palm calls. Shows the aces.

The board runs out: Nine-Five-Deuce-Eight-Four. No help for kings.

Aces hold. Palm wins.

Klaus stands. Says something unprecedented:

"...Good game."

Nine words total. More than anyone has ever heard him speak.

## Closing Scene

The cheese wheel is on its second wheel. Don has been smuggling all night.

Bumblewick is still standing. He hasn't stopped since his full house.

Bowie is gone, all three personas finally unified in exhaustion.

Klaus, reduced to 600 chips, has used nine words. They were enough.

Palm sits behind her mountain of chips, 122 years of patience rewarded.

Leigh grins at the prosciutto she's been stealing all night.

Donna hasn't stood up with a bad hand in three hours.

Peewee is trying to explain "matching cards" to anyone who will listen.

"Same time next week?" Donna asks.

"NEXT WEEK! HA HA!" Peewee confirms.

Don passes out cheese to everyone. The smuggler provides.
