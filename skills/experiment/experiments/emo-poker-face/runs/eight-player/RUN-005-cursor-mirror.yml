# eight-player-005 Cursor Mirror Analysis
# Final run — session summary focus

run_metadata:
  config: eight-player
  run_number: 5
  final_run: true

context_stats:
  total_files_written_session: 20
    # 5 runs × 4 files each (yml, md, cursor-mirror, tells)
  total_lines_written: ~3000

generation_stats:
  hands_simulated: 3
  arcs_completed: 2 (Bumblewick, Bowie)
  player_departure: 1 (Bowie)
  
chip_tracking:
  final_pool: ~18000
  total_rebuys: 7 (Bowie ×4, Donna ×2, Don ×1)
  # Note: Bowie's departure removes his last stack from play

  set_over_set: 4 occurrences (extremely high variance)

constraint_coverage_session:
  highly_triggered:
    - donna_targets_weak: 5
    - bowie_persona_shift: 4
    - klaus_stillness_reads: 3
    
  moderately_triggered:
    - palm_cannot_bluff_don: 0 (never came up!)
    - leigh_donna_enmity: 3
    - bumblewick_folds_to_donna: 1 (early, before growth)
    
  noted_but_not_designed:
    - klaus_word_count_tell: Emerged organically
    - don_cheese_tells: Evolved during play
    - peewee_honest_announces: Ignored by all

interesting_patterns:
  - "Klaus's word count became primary tell — 7 words total"
  - "Bumblewick's arc completed: terror → triumph → standing"
  - "Bowie's multiple rebuys ended in graceful departure"
  - "Cheese became parallel communication channel"
  - "London Triangle coordination visible but not decisive"

comparison_across_runs:
  run_001: "Setup — Bowie fracture, Klaus emergence"
  run_002: "Vendettas — Donna/Leigh explodes"
  run_003: "Klaus dominance — 46% of chips"
  run_004: "Klaus humbled — Palm three-bets words"
  run_005: "Resolution — arcs complete, AA vs KK finale"

meta_observations:
  - "8-player complexity 4× harder than 4-player"
  - "Chip tracking consistently problematic"
  - "Character consistency maintained across 14 hands"
  - "Emergence: unexpected tells (word count, cheese)"
