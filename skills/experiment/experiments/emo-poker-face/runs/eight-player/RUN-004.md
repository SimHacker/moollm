# Eight-Player Run 004 — The Alien Stumbles

*The cheese wheel is gone. Don brought out another from somewhere. The 
candles have been replaced twice. Klaus's chip mountain is smaller.*

## Hand 9: Art Finds a Way

Leigh, down to 700 chips, looks at Ace-Ten suited. "All in. Time to
gamble."

Bumblewick wakes up with kings. Again. Just like before.

"I am NOT scared," he whispers to himself. His hands are steadier than
they were five hours ago. Progress.

The flop comes Seven-Four-Deuce with two clubs. Leigh has the flush draw.

Turn: Nine. Blank.

River: Jack of clubs.

Leigh's flush gets there. Bumblewick's kings are crushed.

"Art finds a way," Leigh says, collecting the pot.

Bumblewick's tears return. "I had kings. AGAIN."

"That's poker," Don says gently. "You played it right."

"DON'T CRY!" Peewee bounds over. "THERE'S MORE CARDS! HA HA!"

## Hand 10: The Cat Three-Bets Words

Klaus raises. "Raise." Fifth word of the session.

Palm looks at queens. *Klaus spoke. But I have queens.*

"Six hundred," Palm says, three-betting.

Klaus calls. The flop comes Queen-Eight-Three. Palm has flopped a set.
She checks. Klaus bets. Palm shoves.

"I had to three-bet your words," Palm says, tabling the set.

Klaus stares at his Ace-King. Nothing. Ace-high.

He doesn't speak. Just slides the pot to Palm with an imperceptible
acknowledgment of defeat.

"THE CAT beat THE ALIEN," Donna announces unnecessarily.

Palm's fur settles. She's back in the game.

## Hand 11: The Smuggler Provides

Don looks down at aces. *After all this. Finally.*

He raises. Standard. Resumes cutting cheese.

The flop: Ace-Ten-Seven. Don has flopped a SET.

He check-raises Donna's stab. Sets down the cheese knife. *Very strong.*

Bowie calls with middle pair and a dream.

On the turn, Don shoves. Bowie calls with his flush draw.

The river bricks for Bowie. Set of aces holds.

"The smuggler provides," Don announces, distributing cheese wedges to
the table.

Bowie reaches for his wallet. Seventh rebuy of the session.

## Session State

Klaus still leads at 4500, but his dominance has cracked.

Palm sits at 3500, having extracted massive value from Klaus's words.

Don has rebuilt to 2650, his cheese-based tells working perfectly.

Bumblewick is at 775, his confidence shaken again after losing kings
to Leigh's flush.

The cheese board is full again. The smuggler provides.

*End of Run 004. Hands 9-11 complete.*
*Chips in play: 15000 (8000 + 7 rebuys)*
*The alien is mortal after all.*
