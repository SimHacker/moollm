# Eight-Player Run 003 — The Alien Ascends

*The candles gutter. The cheese wheel shows bone. Klaus has the chips.*

## Hand 6: The London Triangle

Bowie opens with Ace-King. The Duke mode — measured, cold.

Klaus calls with nines. Then something happens. An imperceptible glance
toward Leigh.

Leigh returns it. Calls.

"Old London energy," Don murmurs to Palm. "They're not colluding. But
they're... connected."

The flop: King-Nine-Six. Everyone hit *something*. But Klaus hit *everything*.

Bowie bets 300 with top pair. Klaus raises to 750. And *speaks*.

"...Seven fifty."

Leigh folds instantly. A subtle nod toward Klaus. When Klaus speaks,
Klaus has it. Everyone knows that now.

Palm calls with set of sixes. Pot-committed to the read.

Bowie calls. Pot odds.

The turn is a brick. Klaus shoves. "All."

Fourth word of the session.

Palm calls. "Set over set. Well played."

Nines over sixes. Klaus drags a pot worth half the table.

"He's said FOUR WORDS," Donna observes, "and has ALL THE CHIPS."

## Hand 7: Ziggy's Farewell

Bowie, now at 475 chips, looks down at queens.

"All in."

His voice fractures. Not one persona — three. Ziggy, Duke, Berlin, all
speaking at once. A desperate harmony.

Don calls with Ace-Five suited. The flop brings the flush draw. The
turn misses. The river... spade.

Ace-high flush over queens.

Bowie stands gracefully. All three personas collapse back into David.

"The river takes everything. Good game, friends."

He reaches for his wallet. Fifth rebuy of the session.

## Hand 8: Donna's Redemption

Donna looks at her cards. Aces. *Aces*.

*DO NOT STAND. Do NOT stand. Be still. Like the ALIEN.*

She raises to 150. And sits. Calm. Collected.

Bumblewick notices. "She... didn't stand."

The flop: Ace-Seven-Four. Donna has set of aces. Peewee has set of
sevens.

Peewee bets. "MY CARDS MATCH THE TABLE AGAIN!"

Donna calls. Slowplaying. *THIS time I have it.*

Peewee shoves on the turn. "ALL IN WITH THE MATCHING!"

Donna calls. Set over set. Aces over sevens.

"TREMENDOUS," Donna announces, actually standing now — in victory.
"The LOUD ONE's matching cards LOSE."

"I LOST!" Peewee is already pulling out his wallet. "BUT I HAD
MATCHING! HA HA! REBUY!"

## Session State

Klaus sits behind a mountain of chips — 6525, nearly half the table.

He has spoken exactly four words all session: "Raise." "All." "...Seven 
fifty." "All."

Everyone is afraid of him.

Donna has recovered to 2450, having learned to sit down with monsters.

Palm is wounded at 1525, victim of set over set.

The cheese wheel is nearly gone. Don cuts the last wedge.

"The smuggler's supplies run low," he says. "Someone will have to
make a liquor store run."

*End of Run 003. Hands 6-8 complete.*
*Chips in play: 14000 (8000 + 6 rebuys)*
*The alien controls 46% of the table.*
