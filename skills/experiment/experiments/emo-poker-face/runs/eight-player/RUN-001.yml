    # CORRECTION: Let me recalculate
    # Starting: 8000 total
    # Bowie lost 1000, rebuys 1000 = 8000 still in play
    # But winner got chips FROM other players...
    # 
    # Hand 1 investments:
    # - Don: 150 + 400 + 400 = 950 invested, folded turn
    # - Palm: 25 + 125 + 800 + 1000 + 1500 + 2000 = 5450... no wait
    # 
    # Let me redo this properly:
    
    # Preflop: Each caller put in 150. 7 callers = 1050
    # Flop: Donna 400, Bowie 400, Leigh fold, Peewee 400, Don 400
    #       Palm raises to 800, so +400 more for those who call
    #       Bumblewick fold, Donna fold, Bowie +400, Peewee fold, Don +400
    #       So Bowie and Don each put in 800 total on flop
    #       Palm's flop investment: 800
    #       Pot after flop: 1050 + 400(donna) + 800(bowie) + 400(peewee) + 800(don) + 800(palm) = 4250
    #       Wait, Donna bet 400, Bowie called 400, then Palm raised to 800
    #       So Bowie pays 400 to call Donna, then 400 more to call Palm = 800
    #       Don pays 400 to call Donna, then 400 more to call Palm = 800
    #
    # Turn: Palm 1000, Don fold, Bowie call 1000
    # River: Palm 1500, Bowie all-in (had 1000 - 150 - 800 - 1000 = ... negative)
    #
    # I'm getting confused. Let me simplify:

chip_recalc:
  # Each player started with 1000
  # Bowie put in: 150 (pre) + 800 (flop) + 1000 (turn) = 1950, but only had 1000
  # So Bowie was all-in on turn for his remaining chips
