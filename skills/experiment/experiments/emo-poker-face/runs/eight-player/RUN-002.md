# Eight-Player Run 002 — Vendettas and Miracles

*Continuation of the chaos. The candles are lower now. The cheese wheel
is half-consumed. The olives are a memory.*

## Hand 3: The Charcuterie War

Everyone saw this coming. Donna and Leigh, finally in a pot together.

Leigh opens for 150, looking directly at Donna's charcuterie board. The
prosciutto is arranged in perfect rosettes. The salami forms a spiral.
It is, objectively, a work of art.

Donna's eyes narrow. She has ace-king. But more importantly, she has
*rage*.

"Five hundred." She stands. She *points* at Leigh. "FIVE. HUNDRED."

Palm's whiskers twitch. *Emotion is about to cost someone dearly.*

Leigh grins. "Call." They reach toward the board.

"DON'T."

"Wasn't going to."

The flop comes Queen-Seven-Deuce. Leigh has top pair. Donna has... 
ace high. And fury.

"ALL IN." Donna shoves her remaining 475. "The THIEF gets NOTHING."

"Thank you for the chips," Leigh says, calling instantly. "And the
charcuterie."

The turn and river brick out. Leigh's queens hold. Donna is eliminated
— for the second time this session.

As Donna storms toward the rebuy line, Leigh reaches over and takes
a single slice of prosciutto.

"For my trouble."

## Hand 4: The Matching Cards

Peewee, down to 350 chips, looks at his hole cards.

Two aces.

"ALL IN! HA HA! MY CARDS MATCH!"

Palm pauses. "He just... announced..."

Klaus calls anyway, AJ suited. Palm calls with eights. The flop comes
Ace-Seven-Three.

Peewee has set over everyone.

"I WON! THE MATCHING CARDS WON! HA HA!"

Don is laughing so hard he nearly chokes on his cheese. "He *literally*
said they match. We called anyway."

"Chaos has its own logic," Bowie observes.

Klaus's eyebrow moves. Imperceptibly. This may be the closest he's
ever come to expressing surprise.

## Hand 5: The Bitterballen Revenge

Bumblewick. Kings.

*Oh dear. Oh no. Kings.*

Leigh opens. Leigh is *looking* at him. The same Leigh who took his
bitterballen. The same Leigh who makes him want to hide under the table.

*Raise*, the voice says. *Like Don taught you.*

But the hands won't stop trembling. "Call," Bumblewick manages.

The flop: King-Nine-Four.

*SET. I have a SET.*

*DON'T SHAKE. Be like Klaus.*

The shaking intensifies. His eyes water.

Leigh bets. "All your chips."

Somewhere in Bumblewick's memory, a voice echoes: *"Good hand, Palm.
That's poker."* That was him. Losing gracefully to Palm's wheel.

But now HE has the hand.

"I... I call."

The river changes nothing. Bumblewick tables kings full of nothing.

"I won?" His voice cracks. "I WON. Against *HIM*."

Leigh actually smiles. Not a predator smile. Something almost like
respect. "Well played, little one. The bitterballen... I underestimated
you."

"YAY BUMBLEWICK! YOU'RE THE BEST!" Peewee rushes over to hug him.

Klaus does something unprecedented: a micro-nod. Visible only to those
who know to look.

Donna, back from her rebuy, watches the goblin triumph. "The GOBLIN
beat the ART THIEF. TREMENDOUS."

## Session State

The chip stacks have shifted dramatically:

- **Palm**: 3775 (still leading, but the gap closed)
- **Klaus**: 2675 (silent, dangerous)
- **Bumblewick**: 1625 (RISING — defeated his tormentor!)
- **Peewee**: 1125 (tripled with "matching cards")
- **Leigh**: 1025 (humbled by a goblin)
- **Donna**: 1000 (fresh rebuy, seething)
- **Bowie**: 925 (quiet session)
- **Don**: 850 (short but surviving)

The charcuterie board is missing one slice of prosciutto.

Bumblewick is still trembling, but now it might be joy.

*End of Run 002. Hands 3-5 complete.*
*Chips in play: 12000 (8000 + 4 rebuys)*
*The goblin rises.*
