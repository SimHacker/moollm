notes: |
  First eight-player run. Complexity increase from four-player is significant:
  - 2× characters = 7× relationships
  - Decision tree much wider
  - Chip tracking more error-prone
  - Had to simplify some calculations to maintain flow
  
  Klaus's "emergence" (speaking) was unplanned but interesting.
  Bowie's persona fracture mechanic worked as designed.
