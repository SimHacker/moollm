  total_tells_tracked: 47
  verbal_tells: 12
  physical_tells: 15
  posture_tells: 8
  object_tells: 7 (cheese-related)
  behavioral_tells: 5
  
  most_reliable_tells:
    - "Klaus word count (100% = premium)"
    - "Don cheese knife (cut = strong, down = monster)"
    - "Bumblewick trembling (present = weak, absent = DANGER)"
    
  most_unreliable_tells:
    - "Donna standing (used both weak and strong)"
    - "Bowie persona (noise overwhelms signal)"
    - "Peewee announcements (100% accurate, 0% believed)"

emergence_session:
  - "Klaus's words became most-watched tell in poker"
  - "Cheese tells evolved to include knife placement"
  - "Absence tells (Bumblewick NOT trembling, Donna NOT standing)"
  - "Triangle coordination via micro-glances"
  - "Peewee's honesty as meta-deception"

arc_completions:
  bumblewick:
    start: "Pure terror, constant trembling"
    end: "Standing ovation, no tears, thanking table"
    key_tells: "Trembling stopped being reliable — now cuts both ways"
    
  klaus:
    start: "Zero words, perfect stillness"
    end: "Nine words, eyes closed briefly, said 'good game'"
    key_tells: "Word count became exploitable"
    
  bowie:
    start: "Three personas shifting randomly"
    end: "All three collapsed into David, graceful exit"
    key_tells: "Fracture became predictable under pressure"

final_observation: |
  The eight-player experiment demonstrated that tell complexity
  scales non-linearly with players. Emergent tells (Klaus's word count,
  cheese knife position) became more valuable than designed tells.
  
  Most important finding: The ABSENCE of a tell is often the strongest
  signal (Bumblewick's trembling stopping, Donna not standing, Klaus 
  saying 'good game').
