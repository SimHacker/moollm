key_finding: |
  The "matching cards" tell demonstrates that explicit information 
  can be dismissed as noise when the source lacks credibility.
  Peewee's announcement was 100% accurate but treated as chaos.

emergence:
  - "Bumblewick's trembling now cuts both ways — hard to read"
  - "Donna's vendetta-tells are pure signal (always emotional)"
  - "Peewee's honesty is ironically deceptive (no one believes him)"
