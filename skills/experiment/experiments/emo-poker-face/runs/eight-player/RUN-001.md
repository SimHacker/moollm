# Eight-Player Run 001 — The London Arrival

*The Gezelligheid Grotto, 9:00 PM. The regulars — Don, Palm, Bumblewick, Donna — 
have settled into their seats. The cheese wheel is fresh. The candles are bright.
Then the door opens.*

## Hand 1: Welcome to MY Table

The London contingent arrives in a wave of scent and sound. Bowie enters first,
shifting between three personas before he even sits down. Klaus follows — or
rather, Klaus is suddenly *there*, having moved without apparent locomotion.
Leigh sweeps in wearing something that might be a coat or might be a sculpture.
Pee-wee bounces through last, already pointing at things.

"CARDS!" Pee-wee announces. "THERE'S GOING TO BE CARDS!"

Donna's eyes narrow the moment Leigh sits down. The Charcuterie Incident has
not been forgotten. The prosciutto she brought tonight was arranged *just so*.

"Welcome to MY table," Donna says, raising to 150 before she's even looked
at her cards.

Palm's whiskers angle forward. *New players. New energies. This will be 
interesting.*

Don slices cheese. "Jenever for the newcomers? Or—" He catches himself.
"Sharp cheddar. The smuggler provides."

---

The flop comes King-Seven-Deuce. Donna fires 400. "FOUR HUNDRED."

Bowie, in Thin White Duke mode, calls without expression. Leigh folds — but 
not before reaching toward Donna's charcuterie board.

"Don't," Donna hisses.

"I wasn't going to," Leigh says, taking an olive.

Palm raises to 800. The fur is *too* still.

Don pauses mid-slice. *Palm has it. Palm definitely has it.* But he calls
anyway — he needs to see.

On the turn, a blank three. Palm bets 1000. Don finally releases, tipping
his cheese knife toward Palm in acknowledgment.

Bowie, shifting into Berlin mode, calls with the clinical detachment of a
scientist dissecting something.

---

The river: Ace of clubs.

Palm bets 1500. And then — *fracture*. Bowie's careful stillness shatters.
Ziggy Stardust erupts from Berlin's corpse.

"ALL IN, DARLING!" Ziggy pushes everything forward.

Palm sighs. "I call. I'm sorry, David."

Two pair — aces and kings. A beautiful hand.

Against a set of sevens.

"Well played, cat," Bowie says, Berlin returning already, the fracture 
healing. "The river giveth."

"WOW! KITTY WON! YAY KITTY!" Pee-wee applauds.

Klaus does not move. But somehow, an impression of a nod occurs.

---

## Hand 2: The Alien Speaks

Bowie rebuys smoothly, 1000 MOOLA appearing from somewhere inside his
third persona.

The button moves. Don, now critically short at 100 chips, watches Klaus
open for 150.

"Raise," Klaus says.

Seven heads turn. Klaus *spoke*.

"He talks?" Bumblewick whispers to Don.

"Apparently."

Don looks down at Ace-Queen suited. One hundred chips left. "All in," he
says. "The cheese smuggler gambles."

Donna wakes up in the big blind with jacks. "FOUR HUNDRED."

Klaus calls. Silently. *Of course silently. The speaking was an anomaly.*

The flop: Queen-Eight-Four. Donna's jacks are suddenly feeling very small.
She bets anyway, standing, projecting power.

Klaus calls. His stillness has become somehow *more* still. A stillness
singularity.

The turn: Ace. Don makes a pair! But—

"All," Klaus says.

Second word of the session. 

"He said 'all,'" Leigh observes, stealing the last olive.

Donna is pot-committed. "Fine. Show me."

Queens. Set of queens. Klaus had queens the whole time, and his stillness
revealed absolutely nothing.

Don's aces lose to the set. Donna's jacks never had a chance.

Two rebuys. The alien collects in silence.

---

## Session State

Palm holds the chip lead at 4275, her set of sevens having crushed Bowie's
dramatic shove.

Klaus sits at 3025, having spoken exactly twice and eliminated two players.

Don and Donna have both rebought, 1000 each, their stacks fresh and their
pride wounded.

Bumblewick hasn't played a significant pot yet. He's watching Leigh with
the expression of a mouse who just noticed a second cat.

Pee-wee is down to 400 chips and doesn't seem to have noticed.

The cheese wheel is half-eaten. The olives are gone.

And somewhere in Klaus's vicinity, an imperceptible satisfaction radiates
into the smoky air.

---

*End of Run 001. Hands 1-2 complete.*
*Chips in play: 11000 (8000 original + 3 rebuys)*
*Chip leader: Palm (4275)*
*The alien has awakened.*
