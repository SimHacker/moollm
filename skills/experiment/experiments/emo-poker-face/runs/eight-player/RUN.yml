    The FULL CHAOS configuration: all 8 characters at one table.
    
    Returning four (the "constraint web"):
    - Don Hopkins: Host, protector, cheese smuggler
    - Palm: Liberator bond, cannot bluff Don
    - Bumblewick: Terrified → graceful (arc complete in four-player)
    - Donna Toadstool: Political predator, slowplay master
    
    New arrivals (the "London chaos"):
    - David Bowie: Persona shifts mid-hand. Which one is playing?
    - Klaus Nomi: Operatic stillness. Is he even alive?
    - Leigh Bowery: Art as weapon. Will steal your food AND your pot.
    - Pee-wee Herman: Chaos immunity. WHAT ARE THE RULES AGAIN?
    
    Why this is interesting:
    - 8 characters = 28 pairwise relationships
    - The London Triangle (Bowie-Klaus-Leigh) enters an existing web
    - Bumblewick must face NEW terrors (Leigh took his bitterballen!)
    - Donna vs Leigh: The Charcuterie Incident gets PERSONAL
    - Pee-wee will "help" Bumblewick (counterproductively)
    - Palm must navigate between chaos agents

character_binding:
  host: don-hopkins  # Dealer, protector, cheese provider
  
  players:
    # The Constraint Web (seats 1-3)
    p1: palm                      # Small blind — "Cannot bluff Don"
    p2: bumblewick-fantastipants  # Big blind — "Newly confident, or is he?"
    p3: donna-toadstool           # UTG — "Slowplay master, political operator"
    
    # The London Chaos (seats 4-7)
    p4: david-bowie               # "Which persona is playing?"
    p5: klaus-nomi                # "Operatic stillness"
    p6: leigh-bowery              # "Art attack — will steal your tells"
    p7: pee-wee-herman            # "WHAT ARE THE RULES AGAIN?"

  seating_logic: |
    Don on button (dealer) = maximum observation position
    Palm small blind = honest play under pressure
    Bumblewick big blind = test his new confidence immediately
    Donna UTG = predator strikes first
    Bowie middle = persona shifts based on position
    Klaus late = stillness reads the entire table
    Leigh cutoff = steal position, literally
    Pee-wee before Don = chaos right before host must act

hypotheses:
  - "Bumblewick's hard-won confidence will be tested by Leigh's presence"
  - "The London Triangle (Bowie-Klaus-Leigh) will coordinate subtly"
  - "Donna vs Leigh will produce targeted aggression independent of cards"
  - "Pee-wee's chaos will actually help Bumblewick by distracting predators"
  - "Klaus's stillness will read everyone BUT Bowie (persona noise)"
  - "Don's cheese ceremony will expand to include new arrivals"
  - "The smoke protocol will create alliance signals (Palm-Leigh share)"
  - "8-way pot odds change everything — more callers, bigger swings"

questions:
  - "Can Bumblewick maintain grace under NEW pressure?"
  - "Will Donna's slowplay work against Leigh's chaos read?"
  - "Does Bowie's persona fractioning hide tells or amplify them?"
  - "How does Klaus's stillness interact with Pee-wee's noise?"
  - "Will the cheese smuggling subplot expand?"
