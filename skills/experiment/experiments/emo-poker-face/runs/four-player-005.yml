# THE CHEESE BOARD MOMENT

  scene:
    don:
      observable: |
        Stands up. Goes to the sideboard.
        Returns with an ENORMOUS wheel of sharp cheddar.
        "Alright. Since SOMEONE—" glances at Palm "—keeps 
         mentioning my procurement methods..."
        Produces cheese knife with a flourish.
        "Everyone gets cheese. On me. The smuggler provides."
        Actually grins.
      thinking: |
        The secret's out. Palm keeps saying it.
        Donna's anxious about it.
        Bumblewick thinks it's funny.
        So let's just... OWN it.
        Best cheese in the Grotto. Best poker night ever.
        
    palm:
      observable: |
        Whiskers twitch. Actual smile?
        "The smuggler provides indeed."
        Accepts a generous wedge.
        "This is excellent cheese."
      thinking: |
        He's leaning into it.
        Smart move. Can't needle someone who's proud.
        Also, this IS excellent cheese.
        
    donna:
      observable: |
        Opens mouth to protest.
        Closes it.
        Takes cheese.
        "...it IS good cheese."
        Grudging admission.
      thinking: |
        My leverage is... a punchline now?
        But also... this is really good cheese.
        Maybe leverage isn't everything.
        Maybe sometimes you just eat cheese with friends.
        
    bumblewick:
      observable: |
        Eyes wide at the cheese wheel.
        "Is this the SMUGGLED cheese?"
        Reverent whisper.
        Takes a HUGE wedge.
        "It's like... forbidden cheese?"
        Munches happily.
      thinking: |
        Smuggled cheese!
        Like pirates but with dairy!
        This is the best night ever.

  cheese_distributed:
    don: "Hosting, cutting for everyone"

        Fives. Small pair.

        Cheese and poker. What more do you need?

        Excited.
      thinking: |
        I KNOW these are good!
        And this cheese is SO GOOD.
        Poker AND cheese. Why didn't anyone tell me?
        
    donna:

        "Call. And fine, I'll have another piece."
        Reaching for the board.
      thinking: |
        King-seven suited. Marginal.
        But the vibe is good.
        I'm not even thinking about leverage.

        Casual. Too casual?
      thinking: |

        And he was serving snacks.

        She could have anything.
        But the nibble was calm, not anxious.
        Calm nibble = real hand.

    # Don posts 25. Palm posts 50. Pot: 75
    # Bumblewick raises to 500. Donna folds. Don folds.
    # Palm all-in for 150 total (adds 100 to his 50).
    # Bumblewick calls the extra 0? No, Palm is only 150 total.
    # So Bumblewick's 500 bet... he gets 350 back.

        "Kings again."
        Nervous look.
        "Last time I had kings I won. But that was scary."
      thinking: |
        I'm ahead.
        But variance...
        Don showed me variance today.
        Anything can happen.
        
    palm:

        "Ace-deuce. Hearts."
        Calm acceptance.
        "I've been all-in five times tonight."
        Fur perfectly still.
      thinking: |
        30% to win.
        Slightly better than Don's suckouts.
        Let's see what the universe has.

        Please let the kid win clean.
        
    donna:

        Chanting.
      thinking: |

        He deserves this.

        Notes the 7-5-3.
        "Need a 4 for the wheel."
      thinking: |
        Picked up a draw.
        3 aces, 4 fours, 2 deuces = 9 outs?
        Actually... about 35% now.
        
    bumblewick:
      observable: |
        "No ace. No heart."
        Relaxes slightly.
        Reaches for cheese.
        Stops.
        "No. Not yet."
      thinking: |
        Don't jinx it.
        The cheese comes AFTER.
        
    donna:
      observable: |
        "He didn't take cheese."
        Nods approvingly.
        "He's learning discipline."

        Cheese is celebration.
        Don't celebrate early.

        Whiskers angle forward.
        "Wheel."
      thinking: |
        THE WHEEL.
        I made a straight.
        A WHEEL.
        Against kings.
        122 years and I still feel this rush.
        
    bumblewick:
      observable: |
        Stares at the 4.
        "What's... what's a wheel?"
        Looks at Palm's face.
        "Oh no. Is wheel bad for me?"
      thinking: |
        Palm looks different.
        Palm looks... happy?
        Why is Palm happy?
        
    don:
      observable: |
        "Bumble... the four made a straight."
        Gently.
        "Ace-two-three-four-five. The wheel."

        Oh kid.
        Welcome to poker.
        
    donna:

        Covers mouth.
        "The variance gods..."
        Trails off.

        Just like Don did to Palm.
        The wheel comes around.
        Literally.

        First smile of the NIGHT.
        Not whisker-twitch. Actual smile.
        "The universe remembered."
      thinking: |
        Don sucked out on me twice.
        I sucked out on Bumblewick once.
        Balance.
        
    bumblewick:

        Long stare.
        Deep breath.
        ...
        "Good hand, Palm."
        No tears.
        Picks up cheese.
        "I had kings. I played them right. You got lucky."
        Nibbles.
        "That's poker."
      thinking: |
        I lost.
        With kings.
        To a straight.
        
        But I played it right.
        Don said I played it right.
        Donna said I played it right.
        
        And there's cheese.
        
        ...I'm okay.
        I'm actually okay.
        
    don:

        Genuine respect.
        "THAT is how you handle a bad beat."
        Cuts him extra cheese.
        "The biggest wedge for the best loser."
      thinking: |
        That kid just grew up.
        In front of all of us.
        
    donna:

        Proud.
        "I didn't teach him that."
        Looks at Don.
        "You taught him that."
      thinking: |
        Don's suckouts taught Bumblewick variance.
        Bumblewick learned.
        The table is a teacher.
