    The full chaos configuration: Don Hopkins hosts 7 of the most 
    psychologically interesting characters from MOOLLM at a poker table.
    
    Tests all five simulation layers at maximum complexity:
    - 8 characters = 28 pairwise relationships
    - Mix of: performers, terrified, analytical, chaotic
    - Rich relationship history (liberation bonds, London triangle, enemies)
    - Full environmental layer (drinks, food, smokes, interruptions)

  host: don-hopkins
  
  players:
    p1: palm                      # "Cannot bluff Don" constraint
    p2: donna-toadstool           # "Performs everything" energy
    p3: bumblewick-fantastipants  # "Terror + surprise courage"
    p4: david-bowie               # "Which persona is playing?"
    p5: klaus-nomi                # "Operatic stillness"
    p6: leigh-bowery              # "Art as strategy"
    p7: pee-wee-herman            # "Chaos immunity"

# Characters instantiated from experiment's local cache (prototype).
# Run configs POINT to prototype; runs DON'T duplicate everything.

instantiation:
  prototype: ../RELATIONSHIPS.yml  # Local cache created for this experiment
  
  # Prototype contains:
  #   - relationships: All pairwise history and poker constraints
  #   - poker_profiles: Per-character tells, drinks, smokes, inner voice
  #   - smoking_protocol: Who smokes, who shares, who declines
  #
  # Run output can either:
  execution_model: shadow_tree  # override only what changes
  # or: copy_and_edit           # copy full state, edit in place

parameters:
  rounds: 5  # Full game: preflop, flop, turn, river, showdown
  
  environment:
    # Use experiment defaults from prototype (../RELATIONSHIPS.yml)
    # Override specific items here if needed
    
  # Character-owned CHARACTER.yml relationships are loaded automatically
  # Poker-specific relationships come from prototype

hypotheses:
  - "Palm's inability to bluff Don creates interesting strategic constraint"
  - "Donna-Leigh enmity will produce targeted aggression"
  - "Bumblewick may find courage through cards"
  - "The London Triangle will coordinate subtly"
  - "Pee-wee's chaos provides relief from tension"
