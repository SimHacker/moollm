      The Pardon: Don frames rebuy as mutual blackmail.
      - Donna returns via political arrangement
      - Hand 5: Donna slowplays queens (NEW skill)
      - Bumblewick recognizes trap, folds correctly

    notes: |
      Don sucks out twice (both on turn).
      Palm busted twice, played perfectly both times.
      Bumblewick traps with aces: "Donna showed me the trap."
      Palm uses "cheese smuggler" as social needle.
      Emergence: Information as weapon; teaching cascade

    notes: |
      THE CHEESE CEREMONY: Don owns smuggler identity.
      "The smuggler provides."
      Hand 9: Don sets while slicing cheese — new tell.
      Hand 10: Donna aces hold — "calm nibble" tell.
      Hand 11: Palm wheels Bumblewick's kings.
      Bumblewick: "Good hand, Palm. That's poker." NO TEARS.
      Emergence: Cheese as parallel communication channel
