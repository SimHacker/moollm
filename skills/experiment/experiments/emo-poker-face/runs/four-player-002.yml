# HAND 2: THE REBUY

hand_2:
  phase: "rebuy_decision"
  
  rebuy_scene:
    don:
      observable: |
        Looks at Palm. Reaches into pocket.
        "I'll stake you, old friend. One grand."
        Slides 1000 🪙 across the table.
        "Consider it a loan against future liberation work."
      thinking: |
        Palm lost with dignity. That's worth backing.
        Besides, three-handed with Donna seething and
        Bumblewick confused would be chaos.
        We need Palm's steadiness.
        
    palm:
      observable: |
        Paw rests on the chips. Long pause.
        "I accept, Don. But not as a loan."
        Pushes 500 back. "Half. Partners in this hand."
        Golden earring catches light as head tilts.
      thinking: |
        Don's generosity is real, not strategic.
        But I won't take full charity. Half keeps my dignity.
        500 is enough to play carefully.
        The little one (Bumblewick) deserves a rematch anyway.
        I want to see what he does with confidence.
        
    bumblewick:
      observable: |
        Eyes wide. "You... you're coming back?"
        Fidgets with his massive stack.
        "I mean... good! That's... good. I think."
        Trembling returns slightly.
      thinking: |
        Oh no. OH NO. Palm is back.
        Palm who I TOOK EVERYTHING FROM.
        They're being nice about it but they must HATE me.
        Now I have all these chips and they have none and
        WHAT IF I LOSE THEM ALL BACK?
        That would be... actually that would be a relief?
        Wait, do I WANT to lose? That's not how poker works!
        
    donna:
      observable: |
        Sharp exhale. "How touching. A bailout."
        Reaches for sparkling water.
        "At least now I have someone worth beating."
        Eyes still on Bumblewick. Not done with him.
      thinking: |
        Don backing Palm. Loyalty. Disgusting.
        But at least Palm plays REAL poker.
        Unlike Bumble-LUCKY over there with his
        accidental genius and apologetic winning.
        Fine. Four players again. More prey.

  stacks_hand_2:
    don: 100  # gave 500 to palm (kept 100 for himself? No, gave 1000, got 500 back = 600-1000+500 = 100)
    # Actually: Don had 600, offered 1000 (from where?), Palm took 500
    # Let me recalculate: Don had 600. He can only give what he has.
    # New interpretation: Don loans 500 from his own stack
    don_corrected: 100  # gave 500 to palm
    palm: 500  # rebuy from Don's stake (half)
    bumblewick: 2550  # unchanged
    donna: 850  # unchanged
    total: 4000  # still correct!
    
  # Actually let's have Don reach into his pocket for OUTSIDE money
  # The table stakes don't have to be the only source
  
  stacks_hand_2_final:
    don: 600  # unchanged, gave OUTSIDE money
    palm: 1000  # full rebuy from Don's pocket (outside stake)
    bumblewick: 2550  # unchanged, the mountain
    donna: 850  # unchanged, still hungry
    total: 5000  # new total (1000 added from outside)

  reactions:
    don:
      observable: |
        Slight nod. Fingers drum once on table.
        "Alright, let's see what the cards say."
        Slides out chips.
      thinking: |
        Jacks. The treacherous hand. 
        Good enough to bet, fragile enough to lose.
        Let's see who wants to dance this time.
        
    palm:
      observable: |
        Fur settles flat. Absolute stillness.
        Watches the table, not the cards.
        "Fresh start."
      thinking: |
        Nines. A rebirth hand. Middle pair.
        Not the strength I had before, but honest strength.
        Don will see I'm comfortable. That's fine.
        He'll read my contentment, I'll read his drums.
        
    bumblewick:
      observable: |
        Peeks at cards. Shaking intensifies briefly.
        Then... stops? Looks confused at his own calm.
        "Okay. Okay. I can... yes."
      thinking: |
        Ace! I have an ACE! That's good, right?
        The other card is small but they're the same suit.
        Mother said matching suits are nice.
        I just won with kings. Maybe... maybe I can play?
        Maybe I'm not TERRIBLE at this?
        This feeling is strange. Is this... confidence?
        I don't trust it.
        
    donna:
      observable: |
        No reaction. Stone. Perfect stone.
        Takes long sip of water. Sets glass down precisely.
        "Interesting table dynamic now."
      thinking: |
        King-queen suited. FINALLY a real hand.
        Last time I had trash and attacked anyway. Stupid.
        This time I have weapons.
        Bumblewick has more chips than GOD.
        Time to take them back.
        STRATEGY this time, not just aggression.

# HAND 2: PREFLOP ACTION

hand_2_preflop:
  action:
    - actor: don
      position: UTG
      action: "raises to 150 🪙"
      stack_after: 450
      observable: |
        Chips slide out smooth. No hesitation.
        "One fifty." Picks up jenever glass.
        Eyes move around table — Palm, Bumble, Donna.
      thinking: |
        Standard open with jacks.
        Palm just rebought, probably tight.
        Bumblewick is... whatever Bumblewick is now.
        Donna is HUNGRY. She'll play back if she has anything.
        
    - actor: palm
      position: BTN (button)
      action: "calls 150 🪙"
      stack_after: 850
      observable: |
        Gentle push of chips. No drama.
        "I'll see it." Tail curls once.
        Brief glance at Don — information exchanged.
      thinking: |
        Nines want to see a flop.
        Don's open is standard, he has something.
        His drumming said medium-strong. Jacks? Tens?
        I won't raise — that commits too much of my new stack.
        Set-mining. The patient path.
        
    - actor: bumblewick
      position: SB
      action: "calls 125 🪙 more (completing to 150)"
      stack_after: 2400
      observable: |
        Hand hovers over chips. Trembles. Steadies.
        "I'll... I'll call too."
        Deep breath. Sits up slightly straighter.
        Still won't make eye contact.
      thinking: |
        Ace is good. Suited is good. I have SO MANY chips.
        Last hand I called and WON.
        Maybe calling is my thing? Maybe I'm a CALLER?
        Don raised, that's scary. Palm called, that's also scary.
        But I have chips. Chips mean I can lose some and still play.
        This is... this is what confidence feels like?
        I hate it. I love it. I hate that I love it.
        
    - actor: donna
      position: BB
      action: "raises to 500 🪙"
      stack_after: 350
      observable: |
        Stands up. Actually STANDS.
        "Five hundred." Voice flat, controlled.
        "Who wants to play REAL poker?"
        Sits back down. Stares at Bumblewick.
      thinking: |
        King-queen suited. THREE callers in front of me.
        I'm not letting this go cheap.
        If I just call, the pot is tiny and I'm out of position.
        SQUEEZE. Make them pay to see the flop.
        Bumblewick has the chips. Let's see if he has the NERVE.
        Last time was a fluke. This time I'm prepared.
        
    - actor: don
      position: UTG
      action: "calls 350 🪙 more"
      stack_after: 100
      observable: |
        Eyebrow raises. "That's a statement."
        Chips slide in. Stack is now tiny.
        "I believe I'll call." Sips jenever.
      thinking: |
        Donna's squeezing. She has something real this time.
        But jacks are still ahead of her range.
        This commits most of my stack. If I hit, I double.
        If not... well, I've been short-stacked before.
        Palm will likely fold, Bumblewick... who knows.
        
    - actor: palm
      position: BTN
      action: "folds"
      stack_after: 850
      observable: |
        Cards placed down softly.
        "Too rich for nines." Small smile.
        Leans back, watches the others.
      thinking: |
        500 to call. My entire rebuy essentially.
        Nines aren't strong enough against this action.
        Donna has something — she doesn't bluff this big without backup.
        Don called despite being committed. He has a real hand.
        I'll sit this one out. Watch. Learn.
        
    - actor: bumblewick
      position: SB
      decision_pause:
        duration: "47 seconds of visible agony"
        observable: |
          Frozen. Completely frozen.
          Staring at his stack. Staring at Donna. At Don.
          "I... I have to decide?" Voice tiny.
          Hands on chips. Not moving.
        thinking: |
          FIVE HUNDRED. Donna raised to FIVE HUNDRED.
          She's STARING at me. Again.
          Don called! Don knows things! Palm folded.
          I have an ace but the other card is just a three.
          If I call I'm in for 500. That's... that's a lot.
          But I have SO MANY chips. 2400! That's more than everyone!
          Last time I won by calling. Maybe I should call again?
          But Donna is STARING. She WANTS me to call.
          That means I shouldn't call? Or should I?
          I don't know. I DON'T KNOW.
          
          ...wait.
          
          Last time she raised with nothing and I had kings.
          This time she raised BIGGER. Does that mean she has MORE nothing?
          Or MORE something?
          Don looked at me after he called. That look said "be careful."
          Or did it say "you've got this"?
          
          The ace is looking at me. The little three is looking at me.
          They're suited. That's pretty. Mother liked pretty things.
          
          I'm going to fold. I should fold. Folding is safe.
          
          But...
          
          What if I win again?
          
      action: "calls 350 🪙 more (completing to 500)"
      stack_after: 2050
      observable: |
        Exhales. Long exhale. Like deflating.
        "I call." Voice barely above whisper.
        Pushes chips forward with both hands. Shaking again.
        Eyes close. "I call."
        Opens eyes. Still won't look at Donna.
      thinking: |
        I did it. I CALLED.
        I'm in the pot with Don and Donna.
        Palm folded. Palm who knows things folded.
        WHY DID I CALL?
        Because... because last time worked?
        The ace is pretty. Suited is pretty.
        Maybe pretty things win.
        I'm going to throw up.

  flop_reactions:
    don:
      observable: |
        Blink. Single blink.
        Picks up jenever. Sets it down without drinking.
        "That's a flop." Voice completely neutral.
        Hands very still.
      thinking: |
        Jack.
        JACK.
        I have three jacks.
        Stay calm. Stay absolutely calm.
        I have 100 chips left. I'm going to get them in.
        Don't look at the jack. Don't look at it again.
        Donna is pot-committed. Bumblewick will... do whatever he does.
        I'm about to triple up.
        Or lose to a flush.
        Two spades on board. Someone might be drawing.
        Push. Get it in. Let variance decide.
        
    bumblewick:
      observable: |
        Leans forward. Squints at board.
        "Those are... spades. Two of them."
        Looks at his cards again. Back at board.
        Starts bouncing his leg under the table.
      thinking: |
        Spades! SPADES! I have SPADES!
        If another spade comes I have a FLUSH!
        That's like... that's FIVE cards! Of the same suit!
        Mother said flushes are very good.
        But the flush isn't here yet. I just have... hope?
        Is hope a hand? Can you win with hope?
        The leg won't stop bouncing. That's a tell. I read about tells.
        STOP BOUNCING THE LEG.
        It won't stop.
        
    donna:
      observable: |
        Stone face cracks slightly. Jaw tightens.
        "No help." Muttered. Very quiet.
        Fingers tap water glass once.
      thinking: |
        Jack. Five. Two.
        I have king-queen. That's NOTHING.
        I have NOTHING on this board.
        A ten gives me a straight but that's FOUR OUTS.
        I put in 500 with the best hand and the flop MISSED me.
        Don looks calm. TOO calm.
        Bumblewick is bouncing. He has something.
        I'm dead. I'm ALREADY DEAD.
        But I have 350 left. That's enough to bluff.
        If I bet, maybe they fold? Don might fold?
        No. Don won't fold. He's committed.
        This is a disaster.
        
    palm:

        Watches from the rail. Fur ripples once.
        "Ah." Very soft.
        Settles deeper into chair.
      thinking: |
        Don hit. That stillness is victory stillness.
        I've seen that stillness on sailors who just found land.
        Bumblewick is bouncing — he's drawing to something.
        Donna's jaw — she missed.
        This hand will define someone.

        I don't have anything yet. Just potential.
        Betting would be... lying? Bluffing?

        I can't bet into this. I have nothing.
        Don will call with anything and I'll be pot-committed to a loss.
        Bumblewick checked, so he doesn't have it either.
        Maybe Don checks and I see a free card?

      thinking: |
        This is the play. Small all-in into big pot.
        If they fold, I take 1650. If they call, I triple.
        I have the set. I'm betting for value.
        Please don't have spades. Please no flush draws.
        Actually, I don't care. Let's gamble.

        For once, not at the other players.
      thinking: |
        100 into a pot of 1750? That's... that's good odds?
        I read about pot odds. I think this is them.
        If a spade comes I win EVERYTHING.
        This is only 100 chips. I have... 2050.
        I can lose 100. I can AFFORD to lose 100.
        This is what having chips means.
        You can take chances.
        Donna said I played the worst poker she'd ever seen.
        But I won.
        Maybe bad poker is GOOD poker?
        No. That doesn't make sense.
        But the call makes sense. I know it does.
        A spade. I just need a spade.

        Bumblewick called IMMEDIATELY. He has a draw.
        If I put in 100, I'm committed to the rest.
        450 total for a hand I can't win?
        No. No. Take the loss.
        But Bumble-WEAK called and I folded?
        HE'S WINNING BY PLAYING BADLY.
        He doesn't know what he's doing and he's WINNING.
        I hate everything about this.

        The little one called quickly. With confidence.
        He has a draw — the spades, obviously. His leg told us.
        But the QUICK call... that's new.
        He calculated. Maybe unconsciously, but he calculated.
        Don is ahead but vulnerable.
        If a spade comes... redemption for one, disaster for another.

        Spade.
        Of course it's a spade.
        Bumblewick's leg was telling us the whole time.
        I'm dead. I have to be dead.
        He called immediately with his draw. He got there.
        Set over flush. Poker's cruelest beat.
        At least I only lost 500 total.

        A SPADE.
        I have ACE SPADE.

        I have a FLUSH.
        I have a FLUSH?
        I HAVE A FLUSH!
        ACE HIGH FLUSH! That's... that's the BEST flush!
        Nobody can have a better flush than me!
        I'm going to cry. Don't cry at the poker table.
        But this is... this is...
        I WON TWICE?
        No. Wait. The hand isn't over.
        But I'm going to win. I KNOW I'm going to win.
        This is what knowing feels like.

      thinking: |
        Spade. He called with a spade draw and HIT.
        He's going to win AGAIN.
        Don had him crushed and now Don is DEAD.

        Don's set is dead.
        And Bumblewick is crying because he's happy.
        Not because he's sad. Happy tears at a poker table.
        I lost to a man who cries when he wins.

        No, that's not how cards work.
        I'm going to win.
        I'm going to win and Don is going to lose.
        Don who was nice to me. Who protects me.

        Don't shimmer. DON'T shimmer.

      total: 4975  # 25 went to Palm as overage? No...
      # 5000 total - donna 350 + donna posted 25 + 325 call
      # Hmm, let me think again:
      # At start of hand 3: palm 350, bumblewick 3800, donna 325, don 450
      # Wait I had donna at 325 earlier. Let me check.
      # After hand 2: don 500 (Palm staked), palm 350, bumblewick 3800, donna 350
      # Total: 5000. Good.
      # Hand 3 blinds: donna posts 25 (325 left), don posts 50 (450 left)
      # Palm all-in 350. donna all-in 325 total (25 already posted, adds 300)
      # Main pot: 325 (donna) + 325 (palm's matching) + 50 (don BB) = 700
      # Palm's extra 25 returned to palm.
      # Palm wins 700 + gets 25 back = 725
      # Final: palm 725, bumblewick 3800, don 450, donna 0
      # Total: 4975? 
      # 725 + 3800 + 450 = 4975. Where's 25?
      # Don's 50 is in the pot. Palm's 350 - 25 returned = 325 in pot.
      # Donna's 325 in pot. Total in pot: 325+325+50 = 700
      # Bumblewick: 3800 (unchanged)
      # Don: 450 (posted 50, folded)
      # Actually Don had 450, posted 50, has 400 behind? No wait.
      # Let me restart:
      # After hand 2: palm 350, bumblewick 3800, donna 350, don 500
      # Blinds: donna SB 25, don BB 50
      # After blinds: donna 325, don 450
      # Palm all-in 350, donna all-in 325 (her remaining), don folds (keeps 450)
      # Pot: 350 + 325 + 50 (dead BB) = 725
      # Palm effective vs donna: 325 vs 325
      # Palm's extra 25 returned.
      # Palm wins: 325*2 + 50 = 700
      # Palm stack: 25 (returned) + 700 = 725
      # Final: palm 725, bumblewick 3800, don 450, donna 0
      # Total: 725+3800+450 = 4975
      # We started with 5000... where's 25?
      # Oh! The dead 50 BB was from don's 500 → 450.
      # The 25 from donna is in the pot.
      # Total money: 725 + 3800 + 450 = 4975
      # Missing 25 is... hmm.
      # Wait, I had the rebuy as 1000 from outside.
      # After hand 1: don 600, palm 0, bumblewick 2550, donna 850 = 4000
      # Rebuy: don gives 1000 from outside, gets 500 back (partners)
      # After rebuy: don 600, palm 1000, bumblewick 2550, donna 850 = 5000
      # No wait, I said don gives 1000, palm takes it, pushes 500 back.
      # So palm gets 500, don keeps 600.
      # Actually in my narrative I said:
      # "Don slides 1000 🪙 across the table"
      # "Palm... Pushes 500 back. 'Half. Partners in this hand.'"
      # Then I wrote stacks: don 600, palm 1000
      # This implies don had outside money.
      # Later after hand 2 I wrote: don 500 (Palm's stake), palm 350
      # OK so palm staked don back with 500.
      # After hand 2: palm 350, bumblewick 3800, don 500, donna 350 = 5000
      # 
      # Hand 3 blinds: donna 25, don 50
      # donna: 325, don: 450, palm: 350, bumblewick: 3800
      # Palm all-in 350. Donna all-in 325.
      # Don folds (50 dead in pot, keeps 450)
      # Bumblewick folds (keeps 3800)
      # Main pot contested: palm 325 vs donna 325
      # Palm's extra 25 unmatched — returned
      # Pot: 325 + 325 + 50 = 700
      # Palm wins: 700 + 25 returned = 725
      # 
      # Final: palm 725, bumblewick 3800, don 450, donna 0
      # Total: 4975
      # 
      # Ah! 25 went to the "rake" (don's dead BB that donna couldn't match)
      # No, don's BB is 50 and it's in the pot.
      # The math: 725 + 3800 + 450 = 4975
      # Started with 5000. Lost 25 somewhere.
      # 
      # OH. Don's 50 BB is in the pot. Don has 450 left (500-50).
      # That's correct.
      # Palm wins 700 (pot) and gets 25 back (unmatched).
      # 700 = 325 (donna) + 325 (palm match) + 50 (don BB)
      # So palm's 350 - 325 = 25 returned + 325 in pot = 350. Correct.
      # Palm ends with 25 + 700 = 725.
      # 
      # 725 + 3800 + 450 = 4975
      # 
      # The 25 difference... ah, it's because donna had 350 and only posted 25 SB then went all-in for 325.
      # 25 + 325 = 350. All in pot.
      # Don's 50 in pot.
      # Palm's 325 in pot (25 returned).
      # Pot = 350 + 50 + 325 = 725
      # Wait, that's 725 not 700.
      # 
      # I think I had a calculation error. Let me fix in the narrative to 725.

    stacks_final:
      palm: 750  # won 725 pot, plus had 25 overage... 
      # Ugh, let me just simplify:
      # Palm put in 350. Pot total was donna 350 + don 50 + palm 350 = 750
      # But donna and palm only fight for main pot: 
      # donna 350 (all her chips) + palm 350 (matching) + don 50 = 750
      # Wait, palm can't win more than donna put in... 
      # Effective stacks rule: you can only win what you put in from each player
      # Palm is bigger stack (350) vs donna (350 total).
      # They're both 350 effective.
      # Main pot: 350 + 350 + 50 = 750
      # Palm wins 750.
      # 
      # Final: palm 750, bumblewick 3800, don 450, donna 0
      # Total: 750 + 3800 + 450 = 5000 ✓

    Palm finally wins one. With aces. Against Donna's doomed gamble.
    Donna played it right and lost anyway.
    Bumblewick folded garbage and didn't apologize for it.
    
    Three-handed now: Palm, Bumblewick, Don.
    The terror, the sage, and the host.
