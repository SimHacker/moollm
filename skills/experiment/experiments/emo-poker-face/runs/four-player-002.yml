# HAND 2: THE REBUY

hand_2:
  phase: "rebuy_decision"
  
  rebuy_scene:
    don:
      observable: |
        Looks at Palm. Reaches into pocket.
        "I'll stake you, old friend. One grand."
        Slides 1000 🪙 across the table.
        "Consider it a loan against future liberation work."
      thinking: |
        Palm lost with dignity. That's worth backing.
        Besides, three-handed with Donna seething and
        Bumblewick confused would be chaos.
        We need Palm's steadiness.
        
    palm:
      observable: |
        Paw rests on the chips. Long pause.
        "I accept, Don. But not as a loan."
        Pushes 500 back. "Half. Partners in this hand."
        Golden earring catches light as head tilts.
      thinking: |
        Don's generosity is real, not strategic.
        But I won't take full charity. Half keeps my dignity.
        500 is enough to play carefully.
        The little one (Bumblewick) deserves a rematch anyway.
        I want to see what he does with confidence.
        
    bumblewick:
      observable: |
        Eyes wide. "You... you're coming back?"
        Fidgets with his massive stack.
        "I mean... good! That's... good. I think."
        Trembling returns slightly.
      thinking: |
        Oh no. OH NO. Palm is back.
        Palm who I TOOK EVERYTHING FROM.
        They're being nice about it but they must HATE me.
        Now I have all these chips and they have none and
        WHAT IF I LOSE THEM ALL BACK?
        That would be... actually that would be a relief?
        Wait, do I WANT to lose? That's not how poker works!
        
    donna:
      observable: |
        Sharp exhale. "How touching. A bailout."
        Reaches for sparkling water.
        "At least now I have someone worth beating."
        Eyes still on Bumblewick. Not done with him.
      thinking: |
        Don backing Palm. Loyalty. Disgusting.
        But at least Palm plays REAL poker.
        Unlike Bumble-LUCKY over there with his
        accidental genius and apologetic winning.
        Fine. Four players again. More prey.

  stacks_hand_2:
    don: 100  # gave 500 to palm (kept 100 for himself? No, gave 1000, got 500 back = 600-1000+500 = 100)
    # Actually: Don had 600, offered 1000 (from where?), Palm took 500
    # Let me recalculate: Don had 600. He can only give what he has.
    # New interpretation: Don loans 500 from his own stack
    don_corrected: 100  # gave 500 to palm
    palm: 500  # rebuy from Don's stake (half)
    bumblewick: 2550  # unchanged
    donna: 850  # unchanged
    total: 4000  # still correct!
    
  # Actually let's have Don reach into his pocket for OUTSIDE money
  # The table stakes don't have to be the only source
  
  stacks_hand_2_final:
    don: 600  # unchanged, gave OUTSIDE money
    palm: 1000  # full rebuy from Don's pocket (outside stake)
    bumblewick: 2550  # unchanged, the mountain
    donna: 850  # unchanged, still hungry
    total: 5000  # new total (1000 added from outside)

  cards:

    palm: [9♥, 9♣]  # pocket nines - "Phil Hellmuth's curse"
    bumblewick: [A♠, 3♠]  # suited ace-rag - "playable if you know how"
    donna: [K♣, Q♣]  # king-queen suited - STRONG

  reactions:
    don:
      observable: |
        Slight nod. Fingers drum once on table.
        "Alright, let's see what the cards say."
        Slides out chips.
      thinking: |
        Jacks. The treacherous hand. 
        Good enough to bet, fragile enough to lose.
        Let's see who wants to dance this time.
        
    palm:
      observable: |
        Fur settles flat. Absolute stillness.
        Watches the table, not the cards.
        "Fresh start."
      thinking: |
        Nines. A rebirth hand. Middle pair.
        Not the strength I had before, but honest strength.
        Don will see I'm comfortable. That's fine.
        He'll read my contentment, I'll read his drums.
        
    bumblewick:
      observable: |
        Peeks at cards. Shaking intensifies briefly.
        Then... stops? Looks confused at his own calm.
        "Okay. Okay. I can... yes."
      thinking: |
        Ace! I have an ACE! That's good, right?
        The other card is small but they're the same suit.
        Mother said matching suits are nice.
        I just won with kings. Maybe... maybe I can play?
        Maybe I'm not TERRIBLE at this?
        This feeling is strange. Is this... confidence?
        I don't trust it.
        
    donna:
      observable: |
        No reaction. Stone. Perfect stone.
        Takes long sip of water. Sets glass down precisely.
        "Interesting table dynamic now."
      thinking: |
        King-queen suited. FINALLY a real hand.
        Last time I had trash and attacked anyway. Stupid.
        This time I have weapons.
        Bumblewick has more chips than GOD.
        Time to take them back.
        STRATEGY this time, not just aggression.

# HAND 2: PREFLOP ACTION

hand_2_preflop:
  action:
    - actor: don
      position: UTG
      action: "raises to 150 🪙"
      stack_after: 450
      observable: |
        Chips slide out smooth. No hesitation.
        "One fifty." Picks up jenever glass.
        Eyes move around table — Palm, Bumble, Donna.
      thinking: |
        Standard open with jacks.
        Palm just rebought, probably tight.
        Bumblewick is... whatever Bumblewick is now.
        Donna is HUNGRY. She'll play back if she has anything.
        
    - actor: palm
      position: BTN (button)
      action: "calls 150 🪙"
      stack_after: 850
      observable: |
        Gentle push of chips. No drama.
        "I'll see it." Tail curls once.
        Brief glance at Don — information exchanged.
      thinking: |
        Nines want to see a flop.
        Don's open is standard, he has something.
        His drumming said medium-strong. Jacks? Tens?
        I won't raise — that commits too much of my new stack.
        Set-mining. The patient path.
        
    - actor: bumblewick
      position: SB
      action: "calls 125 🪙 more (completing to 150)"
      stack_after: 2400
      observable: |
        Hand hovers over chips. Trembles. Steadies.
        "I'll... I'll call too."
        Deep breath. Sits up slightly straighter.
        Still won't make eye contact.
      thinking: |
        Ace is good. Suited is good. I have SO MANY chips.
        Last hand I called and WON.
        Maybe calling is my thing? Maybe I'm a CALLER?
        Don raised, that's scary. Palm called, that's also scary.
        But I have chips. Chips mean I can lose some and still play.
        This is... this is what confidence feels like?
        I hate it. I love it. I hate that I love it.
        
    - actor: donna
      position: BB
      action: "raises to 500 🪙"
      stack_after: 350
      observable: |
        Stands up. Actually STANDS.
        "Five hundred." Voice flat, controlled.
        "Who wants to play REAL poker?"
        Sits back down. Stares at Bumblewick.
      thinking: |
        King-queen suited. THREE callers in front of me.
        I'm not letting this go cheap.
        If I just call, the pot is tiny and I'm out of position.
        SQUEEZE. Make them pay to see the flop.
        Bumblewick has the chips. Let's see if he has the NERVE.
        Last time was a fluke. This time I'm prepared.
        
    - actor: don
      position: UTG
      action: "calls 350 🪙 more"
      stack_after: 100
      observable: |
        Eyebrow raises. "That's a statement."
        Chips slide in. Stack is now tiny.
        "I believe I'll call." Sips jenever.
      thinking: |
        Donna's squeezing. She has something real this time.
        But jacks are still ahead of her range.
        This commits most of my stack. If I hit, I double.
        If not... well, I've been short-stacked before.
        Palm will likely fold, Bumblewick... who knows.
        
    - actor: palm
      position: BTN
      action: "folds"
      stack_after: 850
      observable: |
        Cards placed down softly.
        "Too rich for nines." Small smile.
        Leans back, watches the others.
      thinking: |
        500 to call. My entire rebuy essentially.
        Nines aren't strong enough against this action.
        Donna has something — she doesn't bluff this big without backup.
        Don called despite being committed. He has a real hand.
        I'll sit this one out. Watch. Learn.
        
    - actor: bumblewick
      position: SB
      decision_pause:
        duration: "47 seconds of visible agony"
        observable: |
          Frozen. Completely frozen.
          Staring at his stack. Staring at Donna. At Don.
          "I... I have to decide?" Voice tiny.
          Hands on chips. Not moving.
        thinking: |
          FIVE HUNDRED. Donna raised to FIVE HUNDRED.
          She's STARING at me. Again.
          Don called! Don knows things! Palm folded.
          I have an ace but the other card is just a three.
          If I call I'm in for 500. That's... that's a lot.
          But I have SO MANY chips. 2400! That's more than everyone!
          Last time I won by calling. Maybe I should call again?
          But Donna is STARING. She WANTS me to call.
          That means I shouldn't call? Or should I?
          I don't know. I DON'T KNOW.
          
          ...wait.
          
          Last time she raised with nothing and I had kings.
          This time she raised BIGGER. Does that mean she has MORE nothing?
          Or MORE something?
          Don looked at me after he called. That look said "be careful."
          Or did it say "you've got this"?
          
          The ace is looking at me. The little three is looking at me.
          They're suited. That's pretty. Mother liked pretty things.
          
          I'm going to fold. I should fold. Folding is safe.
          
          But...
          
          What if I win again?
          
      action: "calls 350 🪙 more (completing to 500)"
      stack_after: 2050
      observable: |
        Exhales. Long exhale. Like deflating.
        "I call." Voice barely above whisper.
        Pushes chips forward with both hands. Shaking again.
        Eyes close. "I call."
        Opens eyes. Still won't look at Donna.
      thinking: |
        I did it. I CALLED.
        I'm in the pot with Don and Donna.
        Palm folded. Palm who knows things folded.
        WHY DID I CALL?
        Because... because last time worked?
        The ace is pretty. Suited is pretty.
        Maybe pretty things win.
        I'm going to throw up.

  preflop_complete:
    pot: 1500  # 150+150+150+500+350+200? Let me recalculate
    # don: 150 + 350 = 500
    # palm: 150 (folded, dead)
    # bumblewick: 25 (sb) + 125 (call) + 350 (call raise) = 500
