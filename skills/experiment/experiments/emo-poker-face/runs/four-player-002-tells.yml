# BUMBLEWICK TELL EVOLUTION

bumblewick_arc:
  hand_1:
    baseline_tell: "Constant trembling"
    deviation: "Trembling STOPS when he has monster"
    read_by: "Everyone"
    outcome: "Told the table he had it"
    
  hand_2:
    tell_1: "47-second freeze before calling"
    interpretation: "Calculation, not paralysis"
    read_by: "Palm only"
    tell_2: "Leg bouncing = flush draw"
    interpretation: "Drawing to something"
    read_by: "Everyone"
    
  hand_3:
    tell: "Shrugs and hums with bad hand"
    interpretation: "Comfortable folding — GROWTH"
    read_by: "Palm"
    
  hand_4:
    tell_1: "Calls without apologizing"
    interpretation: "Agency, not fear"
    tell_2: "Loses without tears"
    interpretation: "Acceptance achieved"
    
  arc_summary: |
    Hand 1: Tells betray him (stillness = strength)
    Hand 2: Tells misread (freeze = calculation, not panic)
    Hand 3: Tells show growth (comfortable with bad cards)
    Hand 4: Tells show transformation (no tears, no apology)
    
    Bumblewick's tells evolved from involuntary exposure
    to authentic expression. The terror is still there,
    but it's becoming data, not destiny.
