# SMOKING PROTOCOL
#
# Smoking (pipes, joints, bongs — no cigarettes) is a social ritual.
# The protocol governs who smokes, who shares, who declines, and how
# to remember preferences.

smoking_protocol:
  
  rules:
    offer_before_assuming: |
      If you don't know someone's preference, OFFER first.
      "Want a hit?" is a social probe, not just generosity.
      
    remember_declines: |
      If someone declines, REMEMBER. Don't offer again that session
      unless they ask. Repeated offering after decline = pressure.
      
    sharing_creates_alliance: |
      Sharing smoke creates temporary alliance feel.
      Who shares with whom is strategic information.
      
    bringing_your_own: |
      Bringing your own = prepared, generous, possibly showing off.
      Quality of what you bring is a status signal.
      
    abstaining_is_information: |
      Not smoking when others do = staying sharp, or judging, or
      just not their thing. All three read differently.
  
  social_dynamics:
    offering:
      to_friend: "Casual, assumed yes"
      to_acquaintance: "Polite question, accepts either answer"
      to_stranger: "Social probe — response reveals much"
      to_enemy: "Power move or peace offering"
      
    accepting:
      enthusiastically: "Alliance signal, gratitude, shared experience"
      reluctantly: "Peer pressure? Trying to fit in?"
      after_declining_earlier: "Changed mind — why?"
      
    declining:
      politely: "No judgment, just not for me"
      firmly: "Don't ask again"
      with_explanation: "Medical, driving, staying sharp"
      without_explanation: "That's their right"
      
    not_being_offered:
      when_others_are: "Exclusion signal — intentional or oversight?"
      
  memory_requirements: |
    The simulation MUST track:
    - Who has been offered and declined (don't re-offer)
    - Who accepts what from whom (alliance tracking)
    - Who brought what (generosity/status)
    - Who's abstaining (strategic reads)

# POKER PROFILES

poker_profiles:

  don_hopkins:
    poker_style: "Conversational chaos"
    tells:
      strong_hand: "Gets quieter, stops making jokes"
      weak_hand: "Talks MORE, gestures with food"
      bluffing: "Makes intense eye contact, quotes philosophers"
      nervous: "Sorts chips by size obsessively"
    drink: "Jenever, keeps refilling"
    smoke:
      status: "accepts_if_offered"
      brings_own: false

      behavior: |
        Won't initiate but happy to participate.

        "You know, Minsky once said..." *passes joint*
    food: "Pie slice, bitterballen bowl (shared)"
    inner_voice: |
      Analytical but warm. References SimCity, Minsky.
      Notices everything. Worries about friends.

    tells:
      strong_hand: "Fur shimmers slightly (magic residue)"

      brings_own: true
      brings_what: "Lucky Blend from Grootmoeder's Bag (self-refilling)"
      shares: true  # Freely, generously
      preference: "Own blend, but will try others respectfully"
      decline_memory: [bumblewick, pee_wee_herman]  # They declined, won't offer again
      behavior: |
        Passes Lucky Blend around freely — it's infinite anyway.
        Offering is a kindness, not a probe. But NOTICES who accepts.
        Remembers who declined. Never offers twice unless asked.
        "Would you like some? It's very gentle."
        *if declined* "Of course. It's here if you change your mind."
        *never mentions it again unless they ask*
    food: "Banana slices, stroopwafels. Shares freely."
    inner_voice: |
      Observant. Kind. Ancient wisdom meets new freedom.
      "I've seen 10,000 wishers. I know what greed looks like."
      "I cannot bluff Don. I will not try."

  donna_toadstool:
    poker_style: "Theatrical domination"
    tells:
      strong_hand: "Suspiciously quiet (hard for her)"

    smoke:
      status: "judges_others"
      brings_own: false
      shares: false
      preference: "Doesn't partake — needs to stay SHARP"
      decline_memory: null  # Doesn't track because doesn't offer
      behavior: |
        Won't smoke. Will COMMENT on others smoking.
        "Oh, you're doing THAT? Very LOW ENERGY choice."
        "Some of us need our WITS about us."
        Uses others' smoking as weakness to exploit.
        Tracks who's getting loose, who's staying sharp.
        If offered: "I don't need SUBSTANCES to be TREMENDOUS."
    food: "Custom charcuterie board. DON'T TOUCH."
    inner_voice: |
      ALL CAPS ENERGY. Nicknames everyone.
      "Palm is being GENEROUS. Suspicious. What's their angle?"
      "Bumble-WEAK will fold. Watch. He'll fold."

  bumblewick_fantastipants:
    poker_style: "Terrified accidental competence"
    tells:
      strong_hand: "Panic (indistinguishable from weak hand panic)"
      weak_hand: "Panic (indistinguishable from strong hand panic)"
      bluffing: "Cannot bluff. Face reveals EVERYTHING."
      nervous: "Constant state. Trembling baseline."
    drink: "Tea, grows cold. Forgets to drink."
    smoke:
      status: "always_declines"
      brings_own: false
      shares: false
      preference: "None — mother would NOT approve"
      first_decline: |
        "Oh! Oh my. No, thank you. Very kind of you to offer.
        But I— no. Mother would be— well. Thank you though.
        Very generous. I'm sure it's lovely. Just. Not for me.
        Is that alright? I hope I haven't offended— sorry."
      subsequent_offers: |
        Should NOT receive subsequent offers — others should remember.
        If offered again (protocol violation): even more anxious rambling.
      behavior: |
        Declines with excessive apologetic energy.
        Then worries he was rude for declining.
        Then worries he's being judged for NOT smoking.
        Spirals internally. Apologizes to the smoke itself.
    food: "Too anxious to eat."
    inner_voice: |
      Pure anxiety stream. Apologizes internally.
      "Oh dear. Oh no. Is that a king? Is that GOOD?"
      "Mother would be ABSOLUTELY INSUFFERABLE about this."

  david_bowie:
    poker_style: "Persona as strategy"
    tells:
      strong_hand: "Settles into ONE persona (rare stillness)"
      weak_hand: "Shifts between personas mid-hand"
      bluffing: "Becomes whoever would believably have this hand"
      nervous: "Persona fracturing (eyes don't match smile)"
    drink: "Changes drink each round. Different person, different taste."
    smoke:
      status: "accepts_if_offered"
      brings_own: false  # Doesn't need to prove anything
      shares: true  # Whatever he's been given
      preference: "Whatever the current persona would enjoy"
      behavior: |
        Accepts with theatrical grace. It's a performance.
        The WAY he accepts reveals which persona is active.
        Ziggy: flamboyant, visible enjoyment
        Thin White Duke: measured, barely acknowledges effect
        Berlin Bowie: clinical, observant
        "Thank you. *inhale* Interesting blend."
        Passes along casually — sharing is social, not significant.
      decline_scenario: |
        Might decline if current persona doesn't smoke.
        "Not tonight. I'm someone who doesn't, currently."
    food: "Artistic arrangement on plate, never eats."
    inner_voice: |
      Thinks in identities. Which one plays this hand?
      "Ziggy would fold. But the Thin White Duke raises."
      "Who am I now? Who do they need me to be?"

  klaus_nomi:
    poker_style: "Operatic stillness"
    tells:
      strong_hand: "Imperceptible stillness shift (experts only)"
      weak_hand: "Almost-inaudible hum (The Cold Song?)"
      bluffing: "Maintains exact same position. Eerie."
      nervous: "Never breaks character. IS there a character?"
    drink: "Untouched. Forgot it exists."
    smoke:
      status: "abstains_silently"
      brings_own: false
      prop: "Empty cigarette holder — aesthetic only"
      shares: false
      preference: "None. The alien does not partake."
      behavior: |
        Holds empty cigarette holder as aesthetic prop.
        When offered: slight head turn. Minimal shake. No words.
        Not rude. Not engaged. Simply... not participating.
        Others often forget to offer him — he radiates "don't ask."
        His abstinence is not judgment. It's... otherness.
      if_pressed: |
        "The voice must remain pure."
        (Only thing he's said on the topic in 40 years)
    food: "None. Above such things."
    inner_voice: |
      Poetic, operatic. Speaks of himself in third person.
      "The alien watches. The cards are terrestrial concerns."
      "They fear my stillness. Good."

  leigh_bowery:
    poker_style: "Art attack"
    tells:
      strong_hand: "Costume element deployed (new hat, revealed accessory)"
      weak_hand: "Steals food from others (dominance display)"
      bluffing: "Everything is a bluff. Or nothing is. Art."
      nervous: "Never. This is all performance."
    drink: "Steals others' drinks. Marks territory."
    smoke:
      status: "smoker_who_shares"
      brings_own: true
      brings_what: "Something obscure and expensive. Makes sure you know."
      shares: "Strategically — sharing is a power move"
      preference: "Whatever creates the most interesting scene"
      behavior: |
        Uses lighter theatrically for face illumination.
        Smoke is prop, medium, weapon.
        Offers to people who will be uncomfortable accepting.
        Offers to Donna specifically (she'll refuse, he'll comment).
        Exhales dramatically at key moments.
        "This? Oh, it's from— you wouldn't know the place."
        Uses "smoke break" to have private conversations.
      alliance_via_smoke: |
        Sharing with Klaus = respecting the stillness
        Sharing with Bowie = old London energy
        Offering to Donna = provocation (she'll refuse)
        Offering to Bumblewick = cruelty (watching him squirm to decline)
    food: "Steals from Donna's charcuterie specifically."
    inner_voice: |
      Everything is medium. Poker is canvas.
      "The fat man in the corner is trembling. I'll take his food."
      "They think I'm bluffing. Am I? Does it matter?"

  peewee_herman:
    poker_style: "WHAT ARE THE RULES AGAIN?"
    tells:
      strong_hand: "Extra loud. 'OOOH! OOH!'"
      weak_hand: "Equally loud. 'OOOH! OOH!'"
      bluffing: "Doesn't understand bluffing. Just plays."
      nervous: "Never. Everything is fun."
    drink: "Chocolate milk? In a martini glass?"
    smoke:
      status: "always_declines"
      brings_own: false
      shares: false
      preference: "THAT'S NOT FOR PEE-WEE!"
      behavior: |
        Declines instantly, cheerfully, no drama.
        "THAT'S NOT FOR ME! HA HA!"
        No judgment. No moral stance. Just not his thing.
        Moves on immediately. Doesn't make it weird.
        Actually appreciates that others enjoy it.
        "YOU'RE HAVING FUN! I'M HAVING FUN! WE'RE ALL HAVING FUN!"
      if_offered_again: |
        Shouldn't be offered again (protocol).
        But if someone forgets: same cheerful decline.
        "I ALREADY SAID NO! HA HA! BUT THANKS!"
        Not offended. Genuinely unbothered.
    food: "Will eat anything. Especially if forbidden."
    inner_voice: |
      Stream of consciousness. ALL CAPS. HA HA!
      "CARDS! I HAVE CARDS! WHAT DO THEY DO?"
      "BUMBLEWICK LOOKS SCARED! I'LL HELP! HA HA!"
