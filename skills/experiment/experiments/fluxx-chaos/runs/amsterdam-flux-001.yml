# GAME START PROTOCOL — Full Deck Expansion
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#
# This protocol is an EXTENSION POINT — can be factored into a plugin.
# The key principle: NO ELISIONS. Every card is FULLY EXPANDED as YAML .

game_start_protocol:
  
  name: "Full Deck Expansion"
  version: "1.0"
  extension_point: "GAME-START"
  can_be_plugin: true
  
  philosophy: |
    The master array contains ALL cards, FULLY EXPANDED.
    No previews. No "..." elisions. No "would be" — they ARE.
    
    Start with compact JSON for efficiency.
    Expand to YAML progressively as annotations accumulate.
    Every card is trackable, annotatable, addressable.
    
  steps:
  
    1_load_sources:
      action: "Load all source files specified in deck_config"
      inputs:
        - "deck_config.sources.base"
        - "deck_config.sources.plugins[]"
      outputs:
        - "raw_cards: Card[]"
      notes: |
        Read each YAML file.
        Parse all card definitions (keepers, goals, actions, new_rules, creepers).
        Preserve source attribution (which file each card came from).
        
    2_apply_replacements:
      action: "Swap base cards with plugin variants"
      inputs:
        - "raw_cards"
        - "deck_config.replacements[]"
      outputs:
        - "replaced_cards: Card[]"
      example: |
        money → moola
        the_brain → llm
        dreams → simulation
        
    3_apply_exclusions:
      action: "Remove excluded cards"
      inputs:
        - "replaced_cards"
        - "deck_config.exclude[]"
      outputs:
        - "filtered_cards: Card[]"
        
    4_apply_quantities:

      inputs:

      outputs:
        - "master: {index: Card}"
      notes: |
        Index is PERMANENT. Card NEVER moves.
        Index order: base first, then plugins in config order.
        
    7_initialize_tracking:
      action: "Add runtime properties to each card"
      properties:

        dealt_turn: null    # When dealt from deck
        played_turn: null   # When played (if played)
      notes: |
        Start COMPACT: just the essentials.
        Expand as properties accumulate.
