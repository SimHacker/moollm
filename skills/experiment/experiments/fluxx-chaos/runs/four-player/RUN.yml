# The core group plays Fluxx. Character dynamics from poker carry over,

    The core MOOLLM group discovers Fluxx. 
    
    Why these four:
    - Don: Chaos-curious philosopher, will quote Minsky about rule changes
    - Palm: 122 years of pattern recognition vs. constant rule mutation
    - Bumblewick: Terror of Play All, Hand Limit 0
    - Donna: Will steal EVERYTHING. "Steal Something" is her favorite card.
    
    Dynamics from poker carry over:
    - Palm cannot deceive Don (but can steal from him!)
    - Donna terrorizes Bumblewick (will target his Keepers)
    - Don protects Bumblewick (may give him Keepers)
