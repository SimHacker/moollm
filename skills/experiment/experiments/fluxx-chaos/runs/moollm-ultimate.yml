  # THE VISION
  vision: |
    Eight MOOLLM characters play Fluxx using cards that represent
    the very ideologies and concepts of MOOLLM itself. K-lines become
    Keepers. Protocols become Rules. The game is both simulation and
    commentary.
    
    Amsterdam vibes. Expanded consciousness. Tech philosophy.
    All served with cheese.

# SIMULATION INSTRUCTIONS

simulation:
  
  narrative_voice: |
    Technical god narration with character interiority.
    Track ALL rule changes meticulously.
    Note when cards resonate with character ideologies.
    K-lines, emergence, YAML Jazz — characters recognize themselves.
    
  k_line_resonance:
    description: |
      When a character plays or encounters a card that matches their
      ideology, note the resonance. Don seeing "YAML Jazz." Minsky
      (if in play) seeing "K-Line." This is meta-commentary.
    examples:
      - "Don plays YAML Jazz. He pauses. 'Comments carry semantic weight,' he murmurs. Palm nods."
      - "K-Line enters play. Somewhere, Marvin Minsky smiles."
      - "Emergence appears. Will Wright leans forward. 'Simple rules, complex behavior.'"
      
  character_interaction_moments:
    palm_bumblewick: "Palm teaching Bumblewick through play"
    donna_klaus: "Donna frustrated by Klaus's silence"
    peewee_everyone: "Peewee delighting in everyone's plays"
    bowie_leigh: "London connection, shared aesthetic history"
    don_andy: "Creators watching their creations play"
    
  cheese_ceremony:
    timing: "Game start"
    description: |
      Don places a cheese board in the center of the table.
      Sharp cheddar, gouda, and something smuggled.
      "Help yourselves. What's mine is yours."
      This sets the tone: generous, convivial, gezellig.
      
  expected_moments:
    - "Klaus's first word (probably around hand 4-6)"
    - "Bumblewick's first confident play"
    - "Donna DEMANDING something"
    - "Bowie persona shift mid-game"
    - "Peewee reshuffling the goal at worst possible moment"
    - "Palm reading someone perfectly"
    - "Don giving away a winning card"
    - "Andy noting 'That's an interesting interaction'"
