# RUN-017: The Reckoning

*12 turns of FAFO chaos — Palm takes the lead, but the table burns*

---

## Game 7: The Mexican Standoff Resolves

### The Setup

Palm has Milk in hand. Bumblewick has Cookies as keeper. Don has "Let's Do That Again." The goal is Milk and Cookies. Someone's about to find out.

### Turn 8: Don's War Problem

Don draws — and gets **War** (creeper). War stays with him since nobody has Peace. He copies Steal a Keeper to grab Cookies from Bumblewick.

Now Don has Cookies + War. Can't win with a creeper.

Bumblewick is devastated: "My cookies... again..."

### Turn 9: Bumblewick's 4D Chess

Bumblewick draws Creeper Insurance — and uses it on **Don**, removing War.

> **Don**: "You... saved me?"
>
> **Bumblewick**: "If you can win, the game ends. You owe me now. Karma."

Bumblewick is playing the long game. Tournament karma matters.

### Turn 10: Donna's Chaos Play

Donna draws **Play All** and must use everything. She plays Moon, Rocket, and then...

**Steal a Keeper — takes Cookies from Don!**

> **Don**: "WHAT?! I JUST GOT THOSE BACK!"

Donna now has Moon, Rocket, Cookies. But she needs Milk.

### Turn 11: Palm's Perfect Sequence

Palm draws Exchange Keepers and executes the kill:

1. Plays Time, Sun, Love as keepers
2. Exchange Keepers with Donna — trades everything for Moon, Rocket, **Cookies**
3. Still has **Milk** in hand from earlier
4. **PLAYS MILK**

**PALM WINS GAME 7.**

> **Palm**: "Game."
>
> **Donna**: "I had Cookies! HOW?!"
>
> **Palm**: "Exchange Keepers. Elementary."

Bumblewick mutters: "I removed Don's War for nothing..."

## Tournament Standing After Game 7

| Player | Wins |
|--------|------|
| **Palm** | **2** ← LEADS! |
| Don | 1 |
| Donna | 1 |
| Bumblewick | 0 |

Palm needs **one more win** for the championship.

---

## Game 8: Everyone Versus Palm

### Turn 1: Death Comes for Palm

Palm, confident after taking the lead, draws first.

**Death** (creeper).

> **Palm**: "...Death."

Palm plays Sword and Castle but can't win with Death attached.

> **Dealer**: "The confident shall be humbled."

### Turn 2-4: The Keeper Race

Don plays "5 Keepers" as the goal. Now everyone needs 5 keepers to win.

The race begins:
- Don: Crown (1)
- Donna: Rainbow, Books (2)
- Bumblewick draws **FOUR KEEPERS** — plays Key, Bread (2 + 2 in hand!)

### Turn 5: Palm's Salvation

Palm draws **Creeper Cleanse** and removes Death. Back in the race with 3 keepers.

### Turns 6-8: The Arms Race Escalates

**Don** plays Unicorn, Dragon — now has 3 keepers with Moon, Rocket in hand.

**Donna** goes nuclear:
- Steals Dragon from Don
- Trades Hands with Don (takes Moon, Rocket, gives disruption cards)
- Now has **3 keepers + 2 in hand = 5 next turn!**

> **Don**: "SHE TRADED AWAY MY WINNING HAND!"

**Bumblewick** plays Milk and Cookies — now has **4 keepers + 4 in hand!**

## The Cliff

**End of Iteration State:**

| Player | Keepers | In Hand | Total Available |
|--------|---------|---------|-----------------|
| Palm | 3 | ? | 3+ |
| Don | 2 | Trash/Zap | 2 (disruption only) |
| **Donna** | 3 | Moon, Rocket | **5 — WINS IF SHE PLAYS!** |
| **Bumblewick** | 4 | Choc, Party, Sun, Time | **5+ — WINS IF HE PLAYS!** |

**Turn Order**: Palm → Don → **Donna** → Bumblewick

**THE PROBLEM:**
- Donna plays BEFORE Bumblewick
- If Donna plays Moon and Rocket, she wins with 5 keepers
- Bumblewick would never get his turn

**Don has disruption cards** (Trash a Keeper, Zap a Card). Can he stop Donna?

## FAFO Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Palm drew Death when confident | HUMBLED |
| Keepers stolen this game | 3 |
| Donna's power play | Steal + Trade Hands combo |
| Bumblewick almost-wins | Still 0 wins |
| Tension level | MAXIMUM |

*Next: RUN-018 — Does Donna win? Can Don disrupt? Will Bumblewick EVER get a championship win?*

**Bumblewick is 0-for-7 in championship games. SEVEN GAMES without a win.**

The universe watches...
