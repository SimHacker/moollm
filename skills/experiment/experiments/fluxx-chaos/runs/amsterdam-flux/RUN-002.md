- **Bumblewick** cursed with Impostor Syndrome, Ted Nelson on table
- **Donna** has Richard Bartle (used to spy on Don's hand)

## Round 2 — The Rules Change

### Turn 5 — Don Hopkins 🐰

**Draw Phase**

Don draws: **📜 Draw 3** (New Rule)

His ears perk up. "Oh. Oh, this changes everything."

*Don signs:*
> "The rules aren't just changing — they're accelerating. — DH 🐰"

**Play Phase**

Don has: Poor Bonus, Tool Use, Castle, Will Wright, Draw 3.

He looks at Will Wright. The simulation master. The man who taught him to think in systems.

"I could play Will and create a custom rule," Don muses. "But first..."

**Don plays: 📜 DRAW 3**

The new rule card slaps onto the table.

**RULES CHANGE: Draw 3 cards per turn!**

"Now we're playing Fluxx," Don says, grinning.

**Don's Hand After Turn:** Poor Bonus, Tool Use, Castle, Will Wright

---

### Turn 6 — Palm 🐵 

**Draw Phase (NOW DRAW 3!)**

Palm draws three cards:
- **🧾 TAXES** (CREEPER!) — attaches to MOOLA!
- **🔮 Hallucination** (Keeper)
- **🔬 Ada Lovelace** (Keeper)

The Taxes creeper LEAPS from Palm's hand and attaches to his MOOLA!

"Oh," Palm says flatly. "Oh no."

**🧾 TAXES attaches to 💰 MOOLA!**

*Palm cannot win while Taxes is attached to MOOLA.*

Palm stares at the creeper now contaminating his beautiful money.

"Nothing is certain but death and taxes," he reads. "How... apt."

*Palm signs Taxes:*
> "The universe has a sense of humor. It is not a kind sense of humor. — PLM"

**Play Phase**

Palm's hand: Forbidden Fortune (goal), Take Another Turn (action), The Moon (keeper), Hallucination (keeper), Ada Lovelace (keeper).

He has MOOLA (with Taxes attached). He has Forbidden Fortune goal (needs Crystal Ball + MOOLA). But he CAN'T WIN while Taxes is on his MOOLA.

He also now has **Hallucination**. 

Wait. Donna has the **Creative Hallucination** goal in her hand. It needs Hallucination + Creativity.

Palm makes a calculation.

**Palm plays: 🔄 TAKE ANOTHER TURN**

"Insurance policy," he says. "Cashing it in."

The action resolves. Palm will take another turn after this one.

**Palm takes a BONUS TURN!**

*Palm signs:*
> "Time cannot be borrowed. But it can be stolen. — P"

### Turn 6.5 — Palm's Bonus Turn 🐵

**Draw Phase**

Palm draws three more cards:
- **🔍 Semantic Search** (Action)
- **🥞 Stroopwafel** (Keeper) — Amsterdam classic!
- **🌌 Cosmic Awareness** (Keeper)

*Palm signs Stroopwafel:*
> "Put it on your coffee cup to warm it up. I prefer espresso, but the principle stands. — PLM"

**Play Phase**

Palm surveys his massive hand: Forbidden Fortune (goal), The Moon, Hallucination, Ada Lovelace, Semantic Search, Stroopwafel, Cosmic Awareness.

He has options. But he needs to deal with Taxes somehow.

Then he remembers: **Semantic Search** lets him search the deck for a concept.

**Palm plays: 🔍 SEMANTIC SEARCH**

"I name the concept: 'tax relief'," Palm announces.

The deck is searched. Cards fan out. The search reveals:

| Card Found | Type | Relevant? |
|------------|------|-----------|
| **🎴 Trash a Keeper** | Action | Could discard MOOLA (and Taxes with it) |
| **🎴 Steal a Keeper** | Action | Someone could steal his cursed MOOLA... |
| **🎯 Redistribution** | Goal | Requires Taxes + something |

"Interesting," Palm says. "The tax situation has... options."

He doesn't take any card (Semantic Search only reveals), but now everyone knows what's in the deck.

**Palm's Hand After Turn:** Forbidden Fortune, The Moon, Hallucination, Ada Lovelace, Stroopwafel, Cosmic Awareness

**Palm's Keepers:** 💰 MOOLA (with 🧾 Taxes attached!)

---

### Turn 7 — Bumblewick Fantastipants 🎩

**Draw Phase (Draw 3)**

Bumblewick draws with trembling paws:
- **🧀 Don Hopkins** (Keeper) — THE CARD VERSION OF DON!
- **🎯 Milk and Cookies** (Goal)
- **📜 Multi-turn** (New Rule)

Bumblewick stares at the Don Hopkins card.

"There's... there's a card of YOU?" he asks the actual Don.

Don grins, ears twitching. "International Sharp Cheddar Cheese smuggler. That's what the flavor text says."

*Bumblewick signs Don Hopkins card:*
> "I'm quite confused about whether I'm playing cards with Don or playing Don as a card. — B.F. 🎩"

**Play Phase**

Bumblewick's hand: Fate Reversal (action), The Circus (keeper), Don Hopkins (keeper), Milk and Cookies (goal), Multi-turn (new rule).

The Impostor Syndrome still glows in front of him.

He looks at the Milk and Cookies goal. He doesn't have Milk OR Cookies.

He looks at Multi-turn rule. "If you played an Action, you may play another."

He looks at Fate Reversal. An action.

Strategic insight blooms in Bumblewick's anxious mind.

**Bumblewick plays: 🧀 DON HOPKINS (Keeper)**

The card version of Don appears on Bumblewick's side of the table.

**Don Hopkins Keeper ability activates:** *Once per turn, give any player a card. Draw 1.*

"I, er, give Palm my Milk and Cookies goal," Bumblewick says. "And draw one card."

He draws: **🎁 The Gift** (Keeper)

Palm accepts the goal card, bemused. "Thank you?"

"You have Milk cards probably," Bumblewick explains. "I don't. Seemed efficient."

*Bumblewick signs The Gift:*
> "It's the thought that counts. The thought was panic. — B.F."

**Bumblewick's Keepers:** 🔗 Ted Nelson, 🧀 Don Hopkins  
**Bumblewick's Creepers:** 😶 Impostor Syndrome  
**Bumblewick's Hand:** Fate Reversal, The Circus, Multi-turn, The Gift

### Turn 8 — Donna Toadstool 🍄

**Draw Phase (Draw 3)**

Donna draws with maximum flourish:
- **🎯 Canal Life** (Goal) — needs Canal House + Houseboat!
- **⚓ Houseboat** (Keeper) — SHE HAS BOTH PARTS!
- **🔬 Grace Hopper** (Keeper)

Donna's eyes go WIDE.

She already has Canal House in her hand. She just drew Houseboat AND Canal Life goal.

"Oh," she says. "OH."

*Donna signs Canal Life goal:*
> "LIVING ON THE WATER, DARLINGS. 34 COUNTS OF FABULOUS CANAL LIVING. — DT 🍄"

**Play Phase**

Donna's hand: Creative Hallucination (goal), Canal House (keeper), The Artist (keeper), Canal Life (goal), Houseboat (keeper), Grace Hopper (keeper).

She has EVERYTHING she needs to win. Right now.

Canal House + Houseboat = Canal Life goal WIN.

But she only has Play 1.

She needs to play Canal House first. Then next turn play Houseboat. Then play the goal.

Unless...

**Donna plays: 🏠 THE CANAL HOUSE**

The Amsterdam keeper slides onto the table.

"TREMENDOUS! A house! MY house! TALL, NARROW, and SLIGHTLY TILTED!"

*Donna signs:*
> "I OWN the canals now. — Donna Toadstool"

**Donna's Keepers:** ⚔️ Richard Bartle, 🏠 The Canal House  
**Donna's Hand:** Creative Hallucination, The Artist, Canal Life, Houseboat, Grace Hopper

**DONNA IS ONE TURN AWAY FROM WINNING!**

The table realizes what just happened.

"She has Houseboat," Don says quietly. "And she just played Canal House."

"TREMENDOUS observation, rabbit!"

> "Sometimes the best defense is tactical larceny. — DH"

**Play Phase**

Don's hand: Poor Bonus, Tool Use, Castle, Will Wright, Steal a Keeper, Unicorn, Play All.

He could play Will Wright and create a custom rule. He could play Steal a Keeper and take Donna's Canal House, breaking her win condition.

"WHAT?!" Donna shrieks. "MY HOUSE! MY TREMENDOUS CANAL HOUSE!"

"It's my canal house now," Don says calmly. "Consider it a real estate correction."

*Don offers Donna a slice of Sharp Cheddar Cheese.*

"Sharp Cheddar Cheese?"

"I HATE YOU."

**Don plays: 🏗️ Will Wright** (Keeper)

*Will Wright's ability activates:* When played, create a custom rule (write it down).

Don writes on a napkin:

> **DON'S CUSTOM RULE: "The Houseboat Rule"**

"There," Don says. "I'm not a monster."

Donna grudgingly draws 1 card: **🎸 Music** (Keeper)

**💰 MOOLA and 🧾 TAXES go to discard!**

**Palm plays: 🎯 FORBIDDEN FORTUNE** (Goal!)

"Wait," Don says. "You just trashed MOOLA. Forbidden Fortune needs MOOLA."

Palm pauses. "Ah."

**🎯 FORBIDDEN FORTUNE — THE FIRST GOAL!**

## Dramatic Summary

### What Just Happened

1. **Don changed everything** — Draw 3, then Play All, then stole Donna's Canal House
2. **Palm self-destructed** — Trashed his own MOOLA to escape Taxes, then couldn't win his own goal
3. **Bumblewick had the win and lost it** — Drew Milk AND Cookies but collected a SECOND creeper
4. **Donna nuclear option** — Rules Reset wiped all new rules, but her goals require split keepers

### The Chaos Metrics

- **Goals won:** 0
- **Creepers in play:** 2 (both on Bumblewick)
- **Keepers on table:** 24
