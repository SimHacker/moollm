  philosophy: |
    FAFO = "Fuck Around and Find Out"
    
    Every character will receive EXACTLY what they deserve.
    Karma is INSTANT. Irony is MAXIMUM. Comedy is CRUEL.
    
    - Donna demands revenge? She'll GET revenge... on herself.
    - Bumblewick fears creepers? Creepers will LOVE him.
    - Palm is too calm? We'll TEST that calm.
    - Don explores? He'll find things he DIDN'T WANT TO FIND.
    
  rules:
    - "Karma payback within 3 turns"
    - "Ironic twists MANDATORY"
    - "Gloating triggers immediate reversal"
    - "The confident shall be humbled"
    - "The humble shall be... also humbled (it's funnier)"

      - Turn 5: Drew FOUR MORE CREEPERS (thanks Don)
      - Turn 8: Played Peace anyway (6 creepers)
