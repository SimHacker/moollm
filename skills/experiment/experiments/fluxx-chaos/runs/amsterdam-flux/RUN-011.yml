# 🎯 RECOMMENDATIONS

recommendations:
  
  optimal_batch_size:
    recommended: 8
    rationale: "Most common successful batch, 2 full rounds"
    efficiency: "32 character states per iteration"
    
  victory_turn_handling:
    observation: "Victory turns average 4.67 — shorter"
    recommendation: "Continue to next game in same iteration if victory reached early"
    potential_gain: "Could push mean toward 8"
    
  session_planning:
    observation: "58 turns across 9 gameplay iterations"
    recommendation: "Plan for ~6-8 iterations per full game"
    typical_game_length: "13-21 turns"

# 📉 VISUALIZATION DATA (for external charting)

chart_data:
  
  turns_series: [0, 4, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 5, 0]
  runs_labels: ["000", "001", "002", "003", "004", "005", "006", "007", "008", "009", "010"]
  
  cumulative_turns: [0, 4, 12, 13, 21, 29, 37, 45, 53, 58, 58]
  
  histogram:
    bins: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
    counts: [2, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 6]

observations:
  - "8 turns per iteration is the modal value (6 of 9 gameplay runs)"
  - "Victory runs average shorter (climax happens mid-iteration)"
  - "First iteration (RUN-001) was exploratory at 4 turns"
  - "System stabilized at 8 turns by RUN-002"
  - "No degradation over time — efficiency maintained"
