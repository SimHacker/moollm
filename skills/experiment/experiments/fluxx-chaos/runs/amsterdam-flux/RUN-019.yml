      COSMIC DEALER CLOSING REMARKS
      
      Three tournaments. Twelve games. Hundreds of turns.
      
      We saw the confident humbled (Palm drawing Death).
      We saw the cursed get revenge (Donna's Cosmic Dealer play).
      We saw the tactical fail (Don's self-sabotages).
      We saw the underdog rise (Bumblewick's Long Shot).
      
      FAFO was applied fairly and consistently.
      
      Everyone fucked around.
      Everyone found out.
      
      Some found tragedy. Some found comedy.
      One found redemption.
