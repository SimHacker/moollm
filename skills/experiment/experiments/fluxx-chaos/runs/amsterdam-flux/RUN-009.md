Don claps slowly. "You earned it, Bumblewick. You EARNED it."

Palm nods, serene. "The narrative was perfect. The one who suffered most receives the prize."

Donna throws her hands up. "THIS IS RIDICULOUS! HE WAS LOSING THE ENTIRE TIME!"

"That's the point, Donna," Palm says quietly. "That's the entire point."

Bumblewick looks up, tears in his eyes. "In Game 2, I had Love. I had to give it away because I was blocked. Don used it to beat me."

He looks at the card.

"In Game 3, Love went to Donna. She had to give it away because SHE was blocked."

He smiles.

"And I found it in the discard pile. Where discarded dreams go."

*The Chaotic Dealer bows.*

"The narrative found its ending," the dealer says. "Chaos delivered justice."

## The Meaning of It All

Bumblewick Fantastipants — the anxious one, the self-doubting one, the one who signed "All you need is love. Except when you have two existential crises."

He won the championship.

Not despite his suffering. Because of it.

The game gave him Love twice. First time he was blocked. He let it go.

The game gave someone else Love. They were blocked too. They let it go.

Bumblewick found it in the discard pile. Where everyone's abandoned hopes collect.

And he used it to win.

*That's the story of Love in Amsterdam Flux.*

*That's why we play.*
