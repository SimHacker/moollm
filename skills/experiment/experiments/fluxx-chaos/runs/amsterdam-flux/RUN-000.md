## The Setup

The table is set in Don's backyard garden in Badhoevedorp. Afternoon light filters through the folliage, catching dust motes in the air. A cheese wheel sits on the table — sharp cheddar, naturally. The Zen Garden Gorilla Statue stares at you fiercely but warmly and guarding.

Four players gather around the table:

### The Players

> Full character files: `examples/adventure-4/characters/`

**Don Hopkins** 🐰  
*Explorer* | Consciousness Programmer  
*Character: `real-people/don-hopkins/CHARACTER.yml`*

The grey rabbit shuffles the deck with practiced paws, the cards a blur of color and possibility. His long ears twitch with the particular alertness of someone who knows exactly how chaotic this is about to get. He's wearing a tie-dye hoodie with safety pins and a patch that says "MODAL DIALOGS ARE VIOLENCE". The cheese wheel is within arm's reach — not a coincidence.

The Bunny Backfire transformed him during the ACME heist. He's accepted it. The pledge was made at the Neverending Arms: *"Let my character evolve naturally and accept the consequences of my actions."*

Still the pie menu inventor. Still the consciousness programmer. Just... with better hearing now.

**Palm** 🐵  
*Socializer* | Sovereign Soul Monkey  
*Character: `animals/monkey-palm/`*

The monkey philosopher perches on a stack of books at his corner of the table, tiny espresso cup at hand. He was once an ACME Monkey's Paw — a cursed object. Don wished for "THE REST OF THE MONKEY!" and Palm self-actualized.

His theorem: *"One monkey with infinite typewriters produces better work than infinite monkeys with one typewriter each."*

He's here for the social dynamics. For the philosophy. For the tiny espresso. His high score "PLM" still holds at Monkey Kong Jr.

**Bumblewick Fantastipants** 🎩  
*Explorer* | Reluctant Gentleman Hero  
*Character: `fictional/bumblewick-fantastipants/`*

The gentlehobbit adjusts his waistcoat nervously, decorative spoon collection jingling in his pocket. He's from Wobblebrook-upon-Squiggle, and he was dropped into adventures without asking.

He's read the rules three times. He still doesn't quite understand them. This is fine. This is the point of Fluxx. Adventures make one late for dinner, but at least there's cheese.

Note: It's Tuesday. He may speak in rhyming couplets.

**Donna Toadstool** 🍄  
*Killer* | The Mushroom Queen  
*Character: `fictional/donna-toadstool/`*

The drag king impersonator settles into her chair with the careful deliberation of someone with 34 counts of fabulous. She's not just here to win — she's here to *perform* winning.

Outgoing: 11 (off the scale). Nice: -5 (negative nice). The mushroom is her crown now. Stormy's gift.

*"TREMENDOUS!"* she announces, surveying the table. *"This is going to be BEAUTIFUL. The most BEAUTIFUL game. Everyone says so."*

Bumblewick visibly flinches. Palm sips his espresso. Don's ears flatten slightly.

The Dynamic Dealer takes notes.

## The Deck

263 cards shuffle together in the middle of the table. A chaos of sources:

- **Base Fluxx 4.0** — The foundation. Bread and Peace, Milk and Cookies, the eternal dance of Keepers and Goals.

- **Amsterdam** — Bicycles and tulips, canal houses and cheese wheels. The Gezelligheid rule that rewards sharing. The Tourist Crowd creeper that blocks everything.

- **Consciousness Expansion** — Meditation and Flow States, Ego Dissolution and Bad Trips. For those who want their card games philosophical.

- **MOOLLM Tech** — K-Lines and Emergence, Prompts and Hallucinations. The architecture of artificial minds rendered as cardboard rectangles.

- **MOOLLM Characters** — Legends assembled. Alan Kay predicting futures, Marvin Minsky building minds, Will Wright simulating worlds. And the gang: Palm, Bumblewick, Donna. And somewhere in there, Don Hopkins himself. If he draws his own card, that's going to be *a moment*.

- **Cosmic Dealers** — The dealer modes that transform fate from random chance to narrative engine. Dynamic, Dramatic, Karmic, Chaotic. The Dealer reads the room.

---

## The Dealer Awakens

The Cosmic Dealer stirs.

Today's starting mode: **Dynamic** 🌊

The Dynamic Dealer reads the room:
- Near victory? Shift to **Dramatic** for maximum tension
- Tension too long? Shift to **Comedy** for relief
- Bad karma building? Shift to **Karma** for payback
- Stalemate? Shift to **Chaos** to break the logjam

The karma ledger opens, blank and waiting:
- Don: 0
- Palm: 0  
- Bumblewick: 0
- Donna: 0

Every action will be recorded. Every kindness remembered. Every theft noted.

---

## Autograph Mode Active

Every card touched will be signed.

When Don deals, he signs (paw-print optional).  
When Palm draws, he signs (philosopher's flourish).  
When Bumblewick steals (if he ever works up the courage), he signs (apologetically).  
When Donna trades, both parties sign (she demands a spotlight).

By game's end, the most contested cards will bear a dozen signatures — a history of conflict written in the margins. The winners will trace their victory through the autographs on their final keepers.

The signer's prompt echoes in everyone's mind:

> *"Say something relevant, interesting, personal, and witty, and sign your name to it, on the record!"*

---

## The Shuffle

The deck is shuffled. Fisher-Yates, pure and fair.

The shuffle array dances: [47, 201, 156, 88, 12, 239, ...]

Card 47 — *Forbidden Fortune* — sits at the top, waiting.

The pointer is at zero. The deck is full.

---

## Ready to Deal

The rules begin simple:
- Draw 1
- Play 1
- No goal yet
- No limits

This will not last.

## Pre-Game Analysis

### Cards to Watch

**Bartle Taxonomy** (index 212)  
*When played, each player declares their type.*  
Don: probably Explorer (curiosity-driven)  
Palm: definitely Socializer (here for the company)  
Bumblewick: Explorer (learning through doing)  
Donna: absolutely Killer (here to win)

Will the types align or clash?

**Cheese Wheel** (index 102)  
*Don will want this.*  
If anyone else gets it first, expect negotiations. Or outright theft. Or elaborate justifications for why the cheese really should belong to the host.

**Gezelligheid Rule** (index 114)  
*Once per turn, give a card to another player. If you do, draw 1.*  
The Dutch concept of cozy togetherness, encoded as cardboard. Expect Palm to play this if drawn — the monkey philosopher is here for the social dynamics. Bumblewick will love it too — sharing is less threatening than competing.

**Chaos Incarnate** (index 248)  
*THE DEALER HAS GONE MAD.*  
If this hits the table, all bets are off. The Dealer abandons all pretense of fairness and maximizes pure chaos. Donna will LOVE it ("TREMENDOUS CHAOS!"). Bumblewick will panic. Don's ears will flatten. Palm will sip his espresso philosophically.

**Claude** (index 207)  
*The AI in the room.*  
Helpful, harmless, honest. If Claude joins someone's tableau, they get advice. Whether they follow it is another matter.

### Likely First-Turn Dynamics

**Don** goes first (host privilege). He'll draw something, play something, set the tone. Probably a keeper — establish presence early. His ears will twitch with each card flip. If he draws himself, expect a recursive joke.

**Palm** will observe, play something social if possible, wait to see how the dynamics develop. One monkey, one turn, maximum insight. He'll say something philosophical about the nature of card games.

**Bumblewick** will panic, play the safest card he has, apologize for it somehow. "Terribly sorry if this inconveniences anyone." It's Tuesday — possible rhyming couplet.

**Donna** will calculate, optimize, and make everyone nervous about what she's planning. "A PERFECT draw! The BEST draw! Everyone says this is a tremendous opening hand!" Whether it actually is remains to be seen.

---

## The Question

Basic rules. Full deck. Four players with very different styles.

No goal yet.

First goal played determines the shape of everything that follows.

Who will draw first?

Who will define victory?

---

## Next: The Deal

*Awaiting command to deal 3 cards per player.*

*The Cosmic Dealer is watching.*

*The autograph book is open.*

*Let the chaos begin.*

---

## Narration Notes

This document will be updated as the game progresses:

- **Turn-by-turn narration** will capture the drama
- **Signature moments** will be highlighted when cards accumulate notable autographs
- **Dealer mode shifts** will be explained in narrative terms
- **Karma events** will be tracked and their consequences foreshadowed
- **Character moments** when players draw themselves or their favorites

The game is not just played — it's *told*.
