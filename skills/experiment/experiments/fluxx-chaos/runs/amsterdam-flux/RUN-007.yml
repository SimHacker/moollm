  philosophy: |
    Game 3 demands CHAOS. Not dramatic engineering — pure entropy.
    The winner should feel earned through adaptation, not manipulation.
    
  mechanics:
    - "Random player draws extra card each turn"
    - "Goal changes more likely to succeed"
    - "Creepers distributed randomly, not targeted"
    
  prediction: "This game will be unpredictable. As it should be."
