## The Deal

The grey rabbit shuffles the deck one final time, long ears twitching with anticipation. The Sharp Cheddar Cheese wheel gleams in the afternoon light.

"Three cards each," Don announces. "Standard opening. Let's see what fate has in store."

The Cosmic Dealer stirs in Dynamic mode, karma ledgers open and watching.

### Card 1 — Don Hopkins

Don flips his first card and freezes. His eyes go wide. His ears stand straight up.

**🥧 Pie Menu** (Action)

"Oh," he says softly. Then louder: "OH."

Palm peers over. "Is that—"

"My invention. My actual invention. In card form." Don holds it up reverently. "360 degrees of choice. No hierarchy. The most important UI innovation since the—"

"We know," Donna interrupts. "DEAL."

*The Autograph Book opens. Don signs:*
> "The best interface is no interface, but if you need one... — Don Hopkins 🥧"

### Card 2 — Palm

Palm draws with a philosopher's patience.

**🔮💰 Forbidden Fortune** (Goal)
*Requires: Crystal Ball + MOOLA*

"Ah," Palm says, tiny espresso cup in hand. "A goal requiring foresight and capital. How very... predictive."

*Palm signs:*
> "See the future? One monkey is already living there. — Palm 🐵"

### Card 3 — Bumblewick

Bumblewick reaches for his card with trembling paws.

**🔗 Ted Nelson** (Keeper)
*Special: Link two Keepers — if one is stolen, take both.*

"Oh! A gentleman inventor. Splendid." Bumblewick adjusts his waistcoat. "Hypertext, is it? Sounds frightfully modern."

*Bumblewick signs:*
> "I haven't the faintest idea what hypertext is, but he seems nice. — Bumblewick F. 🎩"

### Card 4 — Donna

Donna draws with theatrical flourish.

**🔮🎨 Creative Hallucination** (Goal)
*Requires: Hallucination + Creativity*

"TREMENDOUS! A goal about VISIONS! About ARTISTRY!" She fans herself. "When errors become art, darling. WHEN. ERRORS. BECOME. ART."

*Donna signs:*
> "I AM the creative hallucination. — Donna Toadstool 🍄 (34 counts of FABULOUS)"

### Card 5 — Don

**📜 Poor Bonus** (New Rule)
*Fewest Keepers draws 1 extra card.*

Don nods. "Balances the game. Helps the underdog." He glances at Bumblewick. "You might like this one."

*Don signs:*
> "Always root for the underdog. Ship the debug tools as features. — DH"

### Card 6 — Palm

**💰 MOOLA** (Keeper)

Palm's eyes sparkle. He already has Forbidden Fortune in hand. He now has half the goal.

"How... fortunate," he murmurs, setting MOOLA aside carefully.

*Palm signs:*
> "Not just money. MOOLA. The distinction matters. — Palm"

### Card 7 — Bumblewick

Bumblewick draws.

**😶 Impostor Syndrome** (CREEPER!)
*Prevents victory. Attaches to any Character Keeper you have.*

"Oh dear," Bumblewick whispers. "Oh dear oh dear oh dear."

The card LEAPS from his hand to the table in front of him. Creepers must be played immediately.

"It says I... I don't deserve to be here?" His whiskers droop. "Well. That does seem rather accurate, doesn't it?"

*The Creeper sits in front of Bumblewick, preventing him from winning.*

*Bumblewick signs with a shaky paw:*
> "Do I really deserve to be here? No. Probably not. — B. Fantastipants 😔"

### Card 8 — Donna

**🏠 The Canal House** (Keeper)

"A HOUSE! A TREMENDOUS house! Tall, narrow, and slightly tilted — just like my APPROVAL RATINGS!"

*Donna signs:*
> "I own MANY houses. The BEST houses. — DT"

### Card 9 — Don

**🔧 Tool Use** (Keeper)

Don examines it thoughtfully. "Extending capabilities. Yes. Tools are just crystallized thought, really."

*Don signs:*
> "Give me a lever long enough and I'll debug the universe. — Don"

### Card 10 — Palm

**🔄 Take Another Turn** (Action)

Palm tucks it away carefully. "Insurance," he explains to no one in particular.

*Palm signs:*
> "Time is the one resource you cannot borrow. Unless... — P"

### Card 11 — Bumblewick

**🔄 Fate Reversal** (Action)
*Swap karma scores with another player.*

Bumblewick brightens slightly. "Oh! This could be useful if someone becomes terribly successful!"

He pauses.

"Which won't be me, obviously." He glances at the Impostor Syndrome Creeper. "Apparently."

*Bumblewick signs:*
> "If I can't win, perhaps I can trade fates with someone who can. — B.F."

### Card 12 — Donna

**⚔️ Richard Bartle** (Keeper)
*Special: PLAYER TYPE ANALYSIS: Name a Bartle type. Look at that player's hand.*

"Richard BARTLE! The ORIGINAL player type guy! Hearts, clubs, diamonds, SPADES!" Donna clutches the card. "With this, I can see EVERYONE'S HANDS!"

*Donna signs:*
> "I know what type you are. LOSER. — DT 🍄"

## Turn 1 — Don Hopkins 🐰

**Draw Phase**

Don draws the top card: **🏰 The Castle** (Keeper)

"A person's home is their castle," Don reads. "Fair enough."

*Don signs:*
> "Every directory deserves its own README. Every castle deserves its own moat. — DH"

**Play Phase**

Don surveys his hand: Pie Menu, Poor Bonus, Tool Use, Castle.

His ears twitch. He looks at the Pie Menu card. Then at the deck.

"I'm going to do something slightly self-indulgent," he announces.

**Don plays: 🥧 PIE MENU!**

The card activates. The top 8 cards of the deck fan out in a perfect circle on the table:

| Direction | Card |
|-----------|------|
| ⬆️ N | 🏗️ Scaffolding (keeper) |
| ↗️ NE | 🏗️ **Will Wright** (keeper) ⭐ |
| ➡️ E | 🔄 Rotate Hands (action) |

Don's paw hovers over the spread. His eyes lock onto one card.

"Northeast," he says. "Obviously."

**🏗️ Will Wright** joins Don's hand.

*Don signs Will Wright:*
> "The boss. The simulation master. SimCity, The Sims, everything. We built worlds together. — Don Hopkins"

The remaining 7 cards are shuffled back into the deck.

"Your turn, Palm."

**Don's Hand After Turn:** Poor Bonus, Tool Use, Castle, Will Wright

## Turn 2 — Palm 🐵

**Draw Phase**

Palm draws: **🌙 The Moon** (Keeper)

"Ah," Palm says, gazing at the card. "The moon. Tidal forces. The rhythm of the night."

*Palm signs:*
> "One small step for a monkey. — PLM"

**Play Phase**

Palm's hand: Forbidden Fortune (goal), MOOLA (keeper), Take Another Turn (action), The Moon (keeper).

Palm considers. He has MOOLA. He has a goal that needs MOOLA + Crystal Ball.

The philosopher makes his choice.

**Palm plays: 💰 MOOLA**

The keeper slides onto the table in front of Palm.

"Establishing a position," Palm explains. "The fortune is forbidden until the crystal ball appears. In the meantime, I have capital."

**Palm's Keepers:** 💰 MOOLA  
**Palm's Hand:** Forbidden Fortune, Take Another Turn, The Moon

---

## Turn 3 — Bumblewick Fantastipants 🎩

**Draw Phase**

Bumblewick draws with the trepidation of someone who's already been cursed once today.

**🎪 The Circus** (Keeper)

"Oh! How delightful!" He brightens. "I do love the circus. The acrobats. The elephants. The... clowns."

He pauses.

"Actually, I'm terrified of clowns."

*Bumblewick signs:*
> "The circus is lovely from a safe distance. Perhaps very far away. — B.F."

**Play Phase**

Bumblewick's hand: Ted Nelson (keeper), Fate Reversal (action), The Circus (keeper).

The Impostor Syndrome Creeper glows malevolently in front of him.

"I suppose I should... do something useful?" He looks at Ted Nelson. "A gentleman inventor. Perhaps he could help."

**Bumblewick plays: 🔗 Ted Nelson**

The keeper appears on the table. Ted Nelson's special ability: *Link two Keepers — if one is stolen, take both.*

"There. Now if someone tries to steal my circus, they'll have to take the hypertext inventor too!"

He blinks.

"That sounded more strategic in my head."

**Bumblewick's Keepers:** 🔗 Ted Nelson  
**Bumblewick's Creepers:** 😶 Impostor Syndrome  
**Bumblewick's Hand:** Fate Reversal, The Circus

## Turn 4 — Donna Toadstool 🍄

**Draw Phase**

Donna draws with maximum flourish.

**🎨 The Artist** (Keeper)

"AN ARTIST! I am SURROUNDED by artists! I AM an artist! 34 counts of FABULOUS artistic expression!"

*Donna signs:*
> "Every performance is a masterpiece. Even the felonies. — Donna Toadstool"

**Play Phase**

Donna's hand: Creative Hallucination (goal), Canal House (keeper), Richard Bartle (keeper), The Artist (keeper).

She has THREE keepers and a goal. The goal needs Hallucination + Creativity.

She doesn't have either required keeper yet. But she can establish presence.

**Donna plays: ⚔️ Richard Bartle**

"I play RICHARD BARTLE!" She slaps the card down. "MUD co-creator! Player types! HEARTS! CLUBS! DIAMONDS! SPADES!"

The special ability activates: *PLAYER TYPE ANALYSIS: Name a Bartle type. Look at that player's hand.*

"I name... EXPLORER!" Donna points at Don. "Show me your hand, rabbit!"

Don sighs and fans out his cards: Poor Bonus, Tool Use, Castle, Will Wright.

Donna's eyes narrow. "Will Wright. Interesting. VERY interesting."

**Donna's Keepers:** ⚔️ Richard Bartle  
**Donna's Hand:** Creative Hallucination, Canal House, The Artist

### Dealer Observations (Dynamic Mode 🌊)

- **Tension Level:** Low (no goal yet)

- **Drama Watch:** Bumblewick's Impostor Syndrome creates narrative tension
- **Mode Shift:** Not yet. Staying Dynamic.

## What's Interesting

1. **Don drew his own invention** — Pie Menu appeared in his opening hand. The Cosmic Dealer's sense of humor? Or destiny?

2. **Palm has half a win condition** — MOOLA is on the table. If a Crystal Ball appears, Palm could win quickly.

3. **Bumblewick's curse** — Impostor Syndrome hit immediately. He can't win until he gets rid of it. Classic Bumblewick luck.

4. **No goal yet** — Four turns in, nobody has played a goal. Victory is undefined. The game is pure positioning.

5. **Donna knows Don's hand** — Richard Bartle's ability revealed Will Wright in Don's hand. Strategic intel.

---

## Next Turn

**Turn 5 — Don Hopkins**

The rules remain Draw 1, Play 1.

Don has: Poor Bonus (new rule), Tool Use (keeper), Castle (keeper), Will Wright (keeper).

Will he play Will Wright and create a custom rule? Or establish keepers first?

The Sharp Cheddar Cheese wheel awaits.
