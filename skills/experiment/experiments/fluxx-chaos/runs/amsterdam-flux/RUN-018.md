# RUN-018: Bumblewick's Destiny

*The moment we've all been waiting for*

## Game 8 Finale: Palm Wins Tournament 2

### The Cruelest Turn Order

Palm draws Tree and Flower. That's 5 keepers: Sword, Castle, Love, Tree, Flower.

**PALM WINS GAME 8.**

> **Palm**: "Five keepers. That's the tournament."
>
> **Donna**: "NO! I had five ready! I was NEXT!"
>
> **Bumblewick**: "I had... I had EIGHT keepers available..."

Donna had 5 keepers ready. Bumblewick had **8 keepers available**. Neither got their turn.

**PALM WINS TOURNAMENT 2: 3-1-1-0**

### The Aftermath

**Donna's Rage:**
> "EIGHT GAMES! I had SIX CREEPERS in one game! I weaponized the Cosmic Dealer! I had FIVE KEEPERS ready! And PALM sips espresso and wins?!"

**Bumblewick's Despair:**
> "I had eight keepers. I've never won a single championship game. Maybe... maybe I'm not meant to win."

**Palm's Humility:**
> "I won because I went first. Turn order is not merit."

## The Cosmic Dealer Intervenes

The dealer reviews the FAFO metrics:

- Gloats punished: 7
- Creeper avalanches: 2
- Near-wins denied: 9
- Ironic reversals: 12

**VERDICT**: The underdog never rose. Bumblewick is **0-8** in championship games. This is unsatisfying.

**DECLARATION**: Tournament 3 — Bumblewick's Last Stand.

### Tournament 3 Special Rules

| Rule | Effect |
|------|--------|
| **Bumblewick Blessing** | +1 draw each turn |
| **Cosmic Pity** | If 4+ keepers and loses, goes first next game |
| **Long Shot** | 3 wins in a row = instant tournament victory |

**Stakes**: If Bumblewick loses Tournament 3 without a single win, he retires from competitive Fluxx forever.

## 🏆 GAME 9: THE MOMENT

### Turn 1: Blessed Draw

Bumblewick goes first (Cosmic Pity — he had 4+ keepers in his Game 8 loss). His +1 Blessing kicks in.

He draws **Love** and **Peace**.

> "Love AND Peace! First turn!"

He plays Love.

### Turn 2: Donna's Mercy

Donna draws "All You Need Is Love" as a goal.

She hesitates.

> "If I play this... Bumblewick wins. He has Love."
>
> "Do I want to be the one who finally gives Bumblewick a win?"
>
> "After everything? After my six creepers?"

She plays it.

**BUMBLEWICK WINS GAME 9.**

> **Bumblewick** (tears streaming): "I... I won? I actually WON?"
>
> **Donna**: "You're welcome. Get off me."
>
> **Palm**: "Finally."
>
> **Don**: "It only took nine games."

## Games 10-11: The Story Continues

### Game 10: Palm's Accidental Win

Don plays "Rocket to the Moon" as a goal. Palm already has Rocket and Moon.

**Palm wins Game 10** without even trying.

> **Don**: "I SET UP PALM'S WIN AGAIN!"

### Game 11: Split Goal

Donna plays "Bread and Chocolate" as a goal.

- Palm has Bread

Donna also drew War (creeper). Of course.
