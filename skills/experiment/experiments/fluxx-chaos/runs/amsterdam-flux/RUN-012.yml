      "Three games. Seventy-one turns. I found Love in a discard pile
      and won a game with it. Classic exploration — the treasure isn't
      where everyone's looking. It's where everyone's NOT looking.
      
      Bumblewick won the championship, and that feels right. He suffered
      more than any of us. He earned it. The explorer in me recognizes
      that some journeys are about the destination, but the best ones
      are about who you become along the way.
      
      Palm played with zen patience. Donna played with chaotic energy.
      Bumblewick played with desperate hope. And I played like I always
      do — following interesting paths, seeing where they lead.
      
      One of them led to Love. That's enough."

# 🐵 PALM — The Philosopher

  character_reflection:
    voice: |
      "I won the first game. The cards redistributed themselves in my
      favor. I did not engineer it. I simply accepted what the universe
      offered.
      
      That is the philosopher's approach to Fluxx. The rules change.
      The goals shift. Chaos reigns. The wise player does not fight
      the current — they flow with it.
      
      Bumblewick's victory was narratively correct. The one who suffers
      most should receive the prize. This is not cruelty; it is balance.
      His creepers were not punishment but preparation.
      
      I sip my espresso. The championship goes to Bumblewick. I am
      content. In Fluxx, as in life, sometimes the best move is no move.
      Sometimes the path to victory is patience.

  character_reflection:

      "I won. I actually won.
      
      For two games, the universe gave me creepers. Impostor Syndrome
      and Alignment Problem — the two things I struggle with most,
      manifested as cards that prevented me from winning.
      
      In Game 2, I had Love. I HAD IT. And I couldn't use it because
      of those creepers. I had to give it away. I watched Don use it
      to beat me. I signed it: 'I had to let you go.'
      
      But then... Game 3. No creepers. Fresh start. And Love ended up
      in the discard pile again — this time because DONNA couldn't
      use it (she had a creeper too).
      
      I found it. In the discard. Where all the discarded dreams go.
      And I used it to win everything.
      
      Maybe that's the lesson? Sometimes you have to let go of what
      you can't keep. And sometimes, if you're patient, it comes back
      to you when you're ready.
      
      I'm the champion now. I still can't quite believe it.
      
      *adjusts tall hat nervously*
      
      But maybe I've earned it."

      No but seriously. I had Love. TWICE. Once in Game 2, once in
      Game 3. Both times, I had a creeper that blocked me.
      
      Tourist Crowd. TOURISTS. The bane of Amsterdam! They blocked
      my bike lanes AND my victory!
      
      Bumblewick wins? BUMBLEWICK?! The anxious one who can't even
      maintain eye contact?! He's the CHAMPION?!
      
      *deep breath*
      
      Fine. FINE. He... played well. He waited. He adapted. He found
      Love in the discard pile where I had to throw it.
      
      Next time, I will be PREPARED. I will have creeper-removal
      cards in reserve. I will NOT let the tourists block my victory!
      
      34 COUNTS OF UNFAIRNESS! 34 COUNTS!
      
      ...but also, congratulations, Bumblewick. You earned it.
      Even if I'm furious about it.
      
      *storms off*
