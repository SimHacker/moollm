## 🎯 Key Findings

### 1. Modal Value: 8 Turns

**6 of 9 gameplay iterations** achieved exactly 8 turns.

This represents **2 full rounds** (4 players × 2 turns each).

**Conclusion:** 8 turns is the natural batch size for this simulation.

### 2. Victory Runs Are Shorter

Victory iterations average **4.67 turns** vs gameplay's **7.33 turns**.

**Why:** Climactic moments (game end) often happen mid-iteration.

**Implication:** Could continue to next game in same iteration.

### 3. First Iteration Was Exploratory

RUN-001 only did 4 turns — establishing characters, testing the system.

By RUN-002, the system stabilized at 8 turns.

### 4. No Degradation Over Time

The mean held steady at 5.8 turns for both halves of the experiment.

The system maintained efficiency throughout.

## 📊 Efficiency Metrics

### Character Simulation Efficiency

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Mean turns per iteration | 6.44 |
| Characters per turn | 4 |
| Character states per iteration | 25.78 |
| Mental layers per character | 4 |
| **Total mental states per iteration** | **103** |

### Target Achievement

| Target | Achieved | Rate |
|--------|----------|------|
| 8 turns/iteration | 6 of 9 | **67%** |

---

## 🔮 Recommendations

### Optimal Batch Size: 8 Turns

- Most common successful batch
- Equals 2 full rounds (all players twice)
- 32 character states per iteration
- Manageable context window

### Victory Turn Handling

**Current:** Victory ends iteration even if early.

**Proposed:** Continue to next game start in same iteration.

**Potential gain:** Push mean from 6.4 toward 8.0.

### Session Planning

| Games | Expected Iterations | Expected Turns |
|-------|---------------------|----------------|
| 1 | 2-3 | 13-21 |
| 3 (championship) | 8-10 | 58-71 |
| 5 | 12-15 | 90-110 |

## 📋 Raw Series Data

For external analysis/charting:

```yaml
turns_series: [0, 4, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 5, 0]
runs_labels: ["000", "001", "002", "003", "004", "005", "006", "007", "008", "009", "010"]
cumulative: [0, 4, 12, 13, 21, 29, 37, 45, 53, 58, 58]
```

## 💡 Insights

1. **The system naturally converges on 8-turn batches** — this appears to be the "comfortable" iteration size.

2. **Victory runs disrupt the pattern** — endings are hard to predict, causing shorter final iterations.

3. **Character simulation scales linearly** — 4 characters × N turns = predictable mental state count.

4. **No quality degradation** — later iterations maintained the same efficiency as earlier ones.

5. **58 turns for a 3-game championship** — reasonable scope for narrative continuity.
