# MOOLLM Amsterdam Flux — Initial Game State
# Run ID: amsterdam-flux-000
# Status: GAME START COMPLETE — Ready to Deal
#
# This is the COMPILED, FULLY EXPANDED game state.
# Created by: state_compiler at EXPERIMENT-START
# Source: amsterdam-flux-001.yml (run config)
#
# EVERYTHING IS HERE. NO EXTERNAL LOOKUPS NEEDED.
#
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# PROTOCOL: ROLLING OUTPUT FILES
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# Each turn produces TWO files:
#   RUN-{N}.yml  — Rolling game state (machine-readable, for LLM)
#   RUN-{N}.md   — Rolling narration (human-enjoyable prose)
#
# ALWAYS WRITE BOTH! The .yml is truth; the .md is story.
# There is NEVER a "final" state — you can always continue!

  # 4. Add card-specific visual_refs from prompts-skeleton.yml
  # 5. Add negative prompt (no text, no borders, anti-patterns)
  # 
  # Example assembly for amsterdam-tulip:
  # = base_style 
  # + "Dutch Golden Age influenced, Vermeer side lighting..."
  # + "warm, inviting, 'I want to collect this'..."
  # + "single perfect tulip, Rembrandt broken colors, 17th century still life..."
