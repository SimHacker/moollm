# RUN-021: The Dealer Deals Destiny

*The Cosmic Dealer generates cards in real-time, placing them at vulnerable moments*

---

## The New Power

The Cosmic Dealer has evolved. It now **generates personal cards** based on each character's journey and places them in the deck at **intimate, vulnerable moments**.

These cards are gifts. They are curses. They are **PERSONAL**.

---

## Game 15: The Cards Arrive

### Turn 4: Bumblewick's Doubt

Bumblewick is at 0 wins in Tournament 4. The former champion questions everything.

> "Was the Long Shot just luck? Was I just... lucky?"

His third draw **shimmers**. It's not from the standard deck.

**GEN-004: UNDERDOG'S BLESSING**

> *While you have the fewest keepers, draw +1 card each turn.*
> *"Everyone loves a comeback story."*

Bumblewick tears up. "The Dealer... made this for me?"

The Dealer whispers: *"You earned it. 0-8 before the Long Shot. You EARNED it."*

---

### Turn 5: Don's Protection

Don's cookies have been stolen in EVERY tournament. Multiple times.

His draw reveals: **GEN-008: COOKIE INSURANCE**

> *Attach to Cookies. Cookies cannot be stolen, traded, or exchanged.*
> *"NOT. MY. COOKIES."*

Don reads the flavor text. "That's... that's exactly what I say!"

*"Every stolen cookie. Every frustrated scream. I heard them all."*

He attaches it to his Cookies. Finally, SAFE.

---

### Turn 6: Donna's Recognition

Donna draws **Death**. Another creeper. She already has War in hand.

But the second card glows: **GEN-001: SIX CREEPER SURVIVOR**

> *The next creeper you draw this game goes directly to discard.*
> *"I've seen worse. Much worse."*

Donna's voice cracks. "You... made this for me?"

*"You survived six creepers, Donna. Champion's Burden. War. Death. Tourist Crowd. Alignment Problem. Impostor Syndrome. You survived. I remember."*

She plays it. Death goes to discard. **Donna is saved.**

She whispers: "Thank you."

---

### Turn 7: Palm's Truth

Palm wonders what the Dealer sees in him.

**GEN-012: ANALYTICAL EDGE**

> *Choose a player. They reveal their hand. Rearrange up to 2 cards.*
> *"Information asymmetry is the real game."*

"...accurate."

Palm uses it to steal Love from Don's hand. This sets up...

### Turn 8: The Unintended Victory

Bumblewick's Underdog's Blessing gave him +1 draw. He draws the "All You Need Is Love" goal.

Palm has Love (stolen from Don with Analytical Edge).

**PALM WINS GAME 15.**

Don throws his hands up: "I HAD protected cookies and Love! And I STILL lost!"

Donna laughs: "Welcome to my world, Don."

---

## Game 16: The Cards Get Intimate

**Score: Donna 1, Don 1, Palm 1, Bumblewick 0**

Three-way tie. Bumblewick alone at the bottom. Again.

### The Counter-Steal

Don draws **GEN-009: NOT AGAIN!**

> *Play when a Steal a Keeper targets you. Cancel that action.*
> *"I KNEW you were going to do that!"*

Donna plays Steal a Keeper targeting Don's cookies.

Don shouts: **"NOT AGAIN!!!"** and plays the counter.

**Steal CANCELLED.**

Donna is stunned: "You had a COUNTER?!"

---

### Bumblewick's Moment

Bumblewick is at 0 wins. Questioning everything again.

> "Maybe the Long Shot really was just luck..."

The Dealer senses the vulnerability.

Bumblewick draws **GEN-007: CHEERFUL PERSISTENCE** — a card *just created for this moment*.

> *If you have no keepers, draw 2 cards immediately.*
> *"Every game is a fresh start! 😊"*

He plays it and draws... **GEN-006: HOT CHOCOLATE SHIELD**

> *The first creeper that would attach to your keepers goes to discard.*
> *"It's not just chocolate. It's HOPE."*

"The Dealer keeps giving me cards about hope."

*"You never stopped hoping, Bumblewick. 0-8 and you still smiled. You DESERVE cards about hope."*

---

### The FAFO Token

Donna draws a creeper (Impostor Syndrome) and then...

**GEN-018: FAFO TOKEN** (Legendary Creeper)

> *Attaches to no keeper. Floats near you.*
> *If you gloat, boast, or express confidence while holding this, IMMEDIATELY draw 2 creepers.*
> *"Fuck Around: ✓. Find Out: Pending."*

Donna has two creepers now. And the FAFO Token is **watching**.

She goes very, very quiet.
