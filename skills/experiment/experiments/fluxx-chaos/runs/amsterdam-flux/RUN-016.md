# RUN-016: Donna's Revenge

*12 turns of FAFO chaos — Donna weaponizes the universe*

---

## The Setup

Tournament 2 stands tied 1-1 between Palm and Don. Donna has zero wins but just drew the most dangerous card in the deck: **The Cosmic Dealer keeper**.

Bumblewick remains at zero. The eternal underdog watches nervously.

---

## Game 6: The FAFO Reversal

### Turn 2: Bumblewick Senses Doom

Bumblewick draws but can't shake the feeling something terrible is coming.

> "Donna has that special keeper... she looks too happy. Last game she had SIX CREEPERS. Now she's smiling? Something terrible is coming."

He plays Draw 3, giving everyone more cards. Standard defensive play.

### Turns 3-4: Building Tension

Palm plays a Hand Limit 10 rule, creating card advantage conditions. Don draws Love AND Peace — the ingredients for an easy win.

Don plays Love as a keeper, holding Peace in reserve. He's confident.

> "I'll hold Peace. Just in case."

### Turn 5: DONNA STRIKES

Donna draws the "All You Need Is Love" goal. Don has Love. If she plays it, Don wins.

**Unless...**

She activates the Cosmic Dealer keeper.

> **"I ACTIVATE THE COSMIC DEALER KEEPER! For this turn, I BECOME THE DEALER!"**
>
> **"DONNA'S DEALER MODE: REVENGE CHAOS!"**
>
> *"The player with the most keepers must give one to the player with the least. IMMEDIATELY."*

Don has Love. Everyone else has zero keepers. Donna chooses herself as recipient.

Don loses Love. Donna gains Love. Donna plays the goal.

**DONNA WINS GAME 6.**

> "REVEEEEENGE! SWEET REVENGE!"

Palm, sipping espresso: "She used the FAFO against the FAFO."

**The woman who had 6 creepers last game just weaponized the cosmic rules to steal victory.**

---

## Game 7: Three-Way Tie

**Score: Palm 1, Don 1, Donna 1, Bumblewick 0**

First to 3 wins. Bumblewick is 0-for-6 in championship games.

### Turns 6-8: Fresh Chaos

Bumblewick draws first, playing Chocolate. He's cheerful — no creepers yet!

Donna plays Draw 2, confident after her revenge win.

Palm plays "Milk and Cookies" as the new goal.

### Turn 9: Don's Almost-Win

Don draws BOTH Milk AND Cookies in a single draw. Incredible luck.

He plays Cookies, planning to play Milk next turn for the win.

> "Next turn I play Milk and WIN."

The dealer notes: *"Don just announced his plan internally. FAFO engaged."*

### Turn 10: Bumblewick's Moment

Bumblewick draws Steal a Keeper.

He doesn't hesitate.

**Bumblewick steals Cookies from Don.**

> Don: "AGAIN?! Someone ALWAYS steals my win!"

But Don still has Milk in hand...

### Turns 11-12: Mexican Standoff

Donna plays a Tree (no strategic value, just staking position).

Palm draws Trade Hands — and executes it on Don.

**Palm now has Don's Milk.**

The situation:
- **Bumblewick**: Has Cookies (keeper)
- **Palm**: Has Milk (hand)
- **Goal**: Milk AND Cookies

If Palm plays Milk, Palm has Milk... and Bumblewick has Cookies. **SPLIT.** Nobody wins.

Don has "Let's Do That Again" — he can copy any previous action.

## The State of Play

**Tournament Score:**
| Player | Wins |
|--------|------|
| Palm | 1 |
| Don | 1 |
| Donna | 1 |
| Bumblewick | 0 |

**Game 7 Situation:**
- Goal: Milk and Cookies
- Palm has Milk in hand
- Bumblewick has Cookies as keeper
- Don has "Let's Do That Again"
- Next player: Don

**Tension Level: MAXIMUM**

Bumblewick is one keeper away from his first championship win. Palm is one play away from... giving Bumblewick the win?

The FAFO continues.
