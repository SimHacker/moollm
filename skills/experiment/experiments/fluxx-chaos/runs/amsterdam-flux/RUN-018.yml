    Bumblewick has played SEVEN championship games without a win.
    He has 4 keepers on the table and 4 more in hand.
    Donna plays before him and has 5 keepers ready.
    
    The universe must decide: 
    Is Bumblewick the eternal underdog? Or is his moment coming?
    
    FAFO watches. FAFO waits.

      Palm wins Tournament 2 with a 3-1-1-0 record.

      while others raged and schemed — Palm proved that in the chaos
      of Fluxx, patience and position win.

    bumblewick_quiet: |

      Not one. In two entire tournaments.

      FAFO REPORT — TOURNAMENT 2
      
      Gloats punished: 7
      Creeper avalanches: 2 (Donna x6, Palm x1)
      Revenge achieved: 1 (Donna's cosmic dealer play)
      Near-wins denied: 9
      Ironic reversals: 12
      
      MOST FAFO'd: Donna (peak 6 creepers, multiple near-wins)
      LEAST FAFO'd: Palm (steady, minimal drama)
      MOST TRAGIC: Bumblewick (0-8, had 8 keepers, never got turn)
      
      VERDICT: FAFO was applied. Comedy achieved. Irony maximized.
      
      BUT...
      
      The underdog never rose. Bumblewick never had his moment.
      This is... unsatisfying.

      TOURNAMENT 3: BUMBLEWICK'S LAST STAND

      Special Rules:
      - Bumblewick Blessing: Bumblewick starts each game with +1 draw
      - Cosmic Pity: If Bumblewick has 4+ keepers and loses, next game he goes first
      - The Long Shot: If Bumblewick wins 3 games in a row, tournament victory regardless of score
      
      Stakes: If Bumblewick loses Tournament 3 without a single win...
      he retires from competitive Fluxx forever.
      
    reactions:
      donna: "Finally! Someone else suffers!"
      palm: "This seems... statistically favorable for chaos."
