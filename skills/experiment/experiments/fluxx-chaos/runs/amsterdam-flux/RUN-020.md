# RUN-020: The Revenge Tour

*20 turns of FAFO chaos — Tournament 4 begins*

---

## Tournament 4: THE REVENGE TOUR

Everyone has unfinished business:
- **Don**: 0 tournament wins, endless near-misses, cookies stolen constantly
- **Donna**: 0 tournament wins, six-creeper trauma, gave away a win
- **Palm**: 1 tournament win, wants to prove it wasn't luck
- **Bumblewick**: 1 tournament win, wants to prove Long Shot wasn't a fluke

---

## Game 13: The Chaos Game (14 turns)

### The Setup

Don plays aggressive from the start: "No more Mr. Nice Strategist."

Palm sets the goal: **Milk and Cookies**.

Donna has Cookies. Don steals them. Donna trades hands to get Don's Milk. Don exchanges keepers with Bumblewick. Play All gets activated.

**CHAOS.**

### The Climax

Under Play All, everyone dumps their hands:

- Bumblewick plays 4 keepers (Chocolate, Time, LLM, Love) → 4 keepers
- Palm steals Cookies → 4 keepers
- Don changes goal to **5 Keepers** and plays 3 keepers → 3 keepers
- **Donna draws 4 keepers** (Dragon, Unicorn, Books, Gift) + already had 2 → **6 KEEPERS!**

### 🏆 DONNA WINS GAME 13!

> **Donna**: "I HAVE SIX KEEPERS! I WIN! I FINALLY WIN!"

Her first tournament game win EVER (not counting Tournament 3 where she gave Bumblewick his win).

---

## Game 14: The Shortest Game (3 turns)

### Turn 1: FAFO Strikes

Donna, fresh off her first win, draws first.

**She draws Death.**

> **Donna**: "DEATH?! ON TURN ONE?! AFTER I JUST WON?!"

Gloating punished. FAFO delivered.

### Turn 3: Don's Moment

Palm plays "All You Need Is Love" as the goal.

Don draws... **Love**.

He plays it.

### 🏆 DON WINS GAME 14!

> **Don**: "FINALLY! FINALLY! After all the stolen Cookies! The traded Milks! I WIN A GAME!"

**3 turns.** Fastest game of the championship.

## Game 15 Begins

**Score: Donna 1, Don 1, Palm 0, Bumblewick 0**

The irony is MAXIMUM:
- The two players with **ZERO** all-time tournament wins are **LEADING**
- The two tournament champions (Palm and Bumblewick) are at **0**

Game 15 is in progress:
- Donna drew another creeper (War)
- No goal set yet
- Bumblewick hasn't played yet this game
