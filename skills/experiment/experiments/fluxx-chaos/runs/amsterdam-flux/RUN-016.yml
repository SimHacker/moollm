      Palm has Milk in hand.
      Bumblewick has Cookies as keeper.
      Neither can win alone.
      
      The play that completes the goal... gives it to the other?
      
    dealer_notes: |
      Palm could play Milk.
      But then Palm has Milk AND Bumblewick has Cookies.
      WHO WINS?
      
      The goal is "Milk AND Cookies" — you need BOTH.
      If Palm plays Milk, Palm has Milk (keeper).
      Bumblewick has Cookies (keeper).
      
      SPLIT. Nobody wins.
      
      BUT WAIT — can someone steal?
