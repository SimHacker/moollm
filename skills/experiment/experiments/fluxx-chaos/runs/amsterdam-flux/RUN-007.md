## The Stakes

**Palm 1, Don 1.**

This is it. Game 3. Winner takes the championship.

The deck is reshuffled. New hands dealt. The signatures remain, but the board is fresh.

Bumblewick has no creepers. Donna has no creepers (yet).

Everyone has a shot.

## The Reshuffle

The Cosmic Dealer gathers all 321 cards. The signatures catch the light — Love alone has 6 entries, a chronicle of Game 2's tragedy.

*Shuffle. Shuffle. Shuffle.*

"Game 3," the dealer announces. "Chaotic mode. I'm not engineering outcomes anymore. Pure entropy. May the best player adapt."
