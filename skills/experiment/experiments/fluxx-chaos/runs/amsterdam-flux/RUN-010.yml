      description: "AI evaluates own output, rewrites prompts, regenerates"
      iterations_example:
        music_v1: "FAILED — card UI overlay"
        music_v2: "OK but too specific (guitar)"
        music_v3: "SUCCESS — abstract dancing notes"
      learning_captured: true
      
    image_mining:

    failure_pattern_recognition:
      patterns_identified: 5
      patterns:
        - trigger: "board game card art"
          failure: "Card UI generation"
          fix: "Use 'still life painting' instead"
          
        - trigger: "magnificent, legendary, epic"
          failure: "Text label overlays"
          fix: "Visual descriptions only"
          
        - trigger: "warm memories, feeling of joy"
          failure: "Quote text overlays"
          fix: "Convert emotions to lighting specs"
          
        - trigger: "Objects with text fields"
          failure: "Text appears in fields"
          fix: "Choose text-free alternatives"
          
        - trigger: "Specific instances for abstract concepts"
          failure: "Too narrow representation"
          fix: "Use symbols/essence instead"

  documentation_created:
    - "SLIDESHOW.md — 1700+ lines, full gallery with mining data"
    - "README.md — Quick reference with prompt recommendations"
    - "32 NN-name-mined.yml files — Individual image analysis"
    - "ARTWORK.md — Pipeline protocol"
    
  key_insight: |
    The 28% regeneration rate wasn't failure — it was learning.
    Each failed image taught prompt engineering lessons.
    By documenting failures AND successes, we created
    transferable knowledge for future image generation.

# 🎯 LESSONS LEARNED

lessons:
  
  game_simulation:
    - "4 characters per turn creates rich interaction space"
    - "Karma tracking enables consistent personality arcs"
    - "Autograph system adds narrative depth without complexity"
    - "Cosmic Dealer modes (dynamic/dramatic/chaotic) vary pacing"
    
  artwork_generation:

# ✅ EXPERIMENT STATUS

status:
  championship: "COMPLETE — Bumblewick wins!"
  artwork_pipeline: "VALIDATED — 32 cards generated successfully"
  documentation: "COMPREHENSIVE — SLIDESHOW, README, mining files"
  learning: "CAPTURED — Failure patterns, recommendations documented"
  
  verdict: |
    Amsterdam Flux is a success on multiple levels:
    
    1. GAME SIMULATION — 71 turns of rich character interaction
    2. NARRATIVE — Bumblewick's arc from tragedy to triumph
    3. ARTWORK — 32 pure artwork cards with quality control
    4. LEARNING — Transferable prompt engineering knowledge
    5. DOCUMENTATION — Human-readable and machine-readable
    
    The experiment proves that AI can:
    - Play complex games with emergent narrative
    - Generate art iteratively with quality control
    - Learn from failures and document that learning
    - Create accessible documentation for humans
    
    This is a foundation for larger-scale card generation
    and game simulation projects.
