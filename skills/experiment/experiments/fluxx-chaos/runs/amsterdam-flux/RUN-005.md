## Round 7 — Desperate Measures

### Turn 22 — Don Hopkins 🐰

**Draw Phase**

Don draws: **🎯 All You Need Is Love** (Goal!)

Don reads it twice. His eyes go wide.

"This... this goal only needs ONE keeper. Just Love."

*Don signs (signature #1):*
> "The Beatles were right all along. — DH 🐰"

**Play Phase**

Don has Moon, Sun, Crystal Ball. None of them are Love.

But if he plays this goal, ANYONE with Love wins instantly!

Does anyone have Love? Nobody knows what's in the deck position...

**Don plays: 🎯 ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE!**

**NEW GOAL: ❤️ ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE**
*Requires: ONLY LOVE! Single keeper goal!*

"Now," Don says, "whoever finds Love first, wins."

The Dramatic Dealer 🎭 notes: *Single-keeper goal deployed. Tension MAXIMUM. Any draw could end it.*

**Goal changed: Hypertext Heroes → All You Need Is Love!**

---

### Turn 23 — Palm 🐵

**Draw Phase**

Palm draws with philosophical calm: **🌷 The Tulip** (Keeper)

Dutch flower. Once worth more than houses. Not Love.

*Palm signs:*
> "Tulip mania teaches us: value is collective hallucination. — PLM"

**Play Phase**

**Palm plays: 🌷 THE TULIP**

But wait — Keeper Limit 3! Palm already has 3 keepers!

Palm must discard one to play Tulip.

Palm discards: K-Line → discard pile

**Palm's Keepers:** Ted Nelson, Cosmic Awareness, The Tulip

---

### Turn 24 — Bumblewick Fantastipants 🎩

**Draw Phase**

Bumblewick draws: **❤️ LOVE!!!** (Keeper)

Bumblewick FREEZES.

The room goes silent.

"I..." Bumblewick's voice cracks. "I have Love."

The goal is All You Need Is Love. Bumblewick just drew Love.

**IF HE PLAYS IT, HE WINS!**

But.

BUT.

Bumblewick has **Impostor Syndrome** and **Alignment Problem**.

TWO CREEPERS PREVENT VICTORY.

"I can't," Bumblewick whispers. "I have the winning card. I can't use it."

*Bumblewick signs Love with tears in his eyes:*
> "All you need is love. Except when you have two existential crises. — B.F. 🎩 💔"

**Play Phase**

Bumblewick's hand: Douglas Hofstadter, Trash a New Rule, LOVE.

He could:
1. Play Love (completes goal, but creepers prevent victory)
2. Play Trash a New Rule (discard Keeper Limit 3 or Dramatic Dealer)
3. Play Douglas Hofstadter (useless now, goal changed)

Strategic insight: If he trashes Keeper Limit 3, he can build more keepers... but still can't win with 2 creepers.

If he trashes Dramatic Dealer, the tension reduces... but still can't win.

**Bumblewick plays: 🎴 TRASH A NEW RULE!**

Target: **Keeper Limit 3**

**KEEPER LIMIT 3 IS GONE!**

"If I can't win," Bumblewick says, "at least I can make the board less miserable."

**Rules now:** Draw 1, Play 1, Dramatic Dealer (no more keeper limit!)

---

### Turn 25 — Donna Toadstool 🍄

**Draw Phase**

Donna draws: **📊 Karma Check** (Action)

"All players reveal their karma scores," she reads. "FASCINATING. I will EXPOSE EVERYONE."

*Donna signs:*
> "I love knowing things about people. ESPECIALLY embarrassing things. — DT 🍄"

**Play Phase**

**Donna plays: 📊 KARMA CHECK!**

**KARMA REVEALED:**

| Player | Karma | Reaction |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Don | +5 | "Not bad." |
| Palm | +4 | *sips espresso* |
| Bumblewick | -1 | "That seems... accurate." |
| Donna | +2 | "ONLY +2?! I demand a RECOUNT!" |

**Total table karma: +10**

"The game is net positive," Palm observes. "Despite Donna."

"DESPITE?!"

---

### Turn 26 — Don Hopkins 🐰

**Draw Phase**

Don draws: **🃏 The Jester's Hat** (Keeper)

Special ability: Your karma never goes below 0.

*Don signs:*
> "The fool speaks truth to power. I've been that fool. — DH"

**Play Phase**

Don can now have more than 3 keepers (limit removed!).

**Don plays: 🃏 THE JESTER'S HAT**

**Don's Keepers:** Moon, Sun, Crystal Ball, Jester's Hat (4 keepers!)

Don's karma is protected. But he still doesn't have Love.

---

### Turn 27 — Palm 🐵

**Draw Phase**

Palm draws: **🎴 Steal a Keeper** (Action!)

Palm looks at the table. Bumblewick has Love in hand. Can't steal from hand.

But... Palm could steal Don's Crystal Ball. Or Donna's Richard Bartle.

Or...

*Palm signs:*
> "Sometimes the strategic move is not the obvious one. — PLM"

**Play Phase**

**Palm plays: 🎴 STEAL A KEEPER!**

Palm targets: **Bumblewick's Ada Lovelace**

"Wait," Don says. "Why Ada Lovelace? She's not useful for the current goal."

Palm smiles. "Ada Lovelace has a special ability. Actions you play are copied."

Palm now has Ada Lovelace!

**Palm's Keepers:** Ted Nelson, Cosmic Awareness, Tulip, Ada Lovelace (4 keepers!)

---

### Turn 28 — Bumblewick Fantastipants 🎩

**Draw Phase**

Bumblewick draws: **🎴 No Limits** (Action)

"Discard all limit rules." But Keeper Limit is already gone...

*Bumblewick signs with resignation:*
> "I keep drawing things that would have been useful five minutes ago. — B.F."

**Play Phase**

Bumblewick's hand: Douglas Hofstadter, LOVE, No Limits.

He STILL has Love. He STILL has two creepers.

Can he get rid of the creepers somehow?

Checking the rules... Creepers can be:
- Trashed by specific cards
- Passed by specific actions
- Attached to keepers (and discarded with them)

Bumblewick doesn't have any of those options.

**Bumblewick plays: 🎴 NO LIMITS**

It does nothing (no limit rules active). But he had to play something.

"This is fine," Bumblewick says, not fine at all.

---

### Turn 29 — Donna Toadstool 🍄

**Draw Phase**

Donna draws: **📸 TOURIST CROWD** (CREEPER!)

"Prevents victory. Too many tourists!"

The creeper LEAPS to Donna's tableau!

"NO!" Donna shrieks. "NOT ME! I AM FABULOUS! I DON'T GET CREEPERS!"

**📸 TOURIST CROWD attaches to Donna!**

*Donna signs with rage:*
> "They're blocking the BIKE LANES! 34 counts of BLOCKING! — DT 🍄 😤"

**Play Phase**

Donna has nothing in hand (creeper played automatically).

She already used her play on the creeper attachment.

**Donna's Creepers:** Tourist Crowd (1)

**BOTH DONNA AND BUMBLEWICK ARE NOW BLOCKED FROM VICTORY!**

---

## End of Round 8

### Board State After Turn 29

| Player | Keepers | Creepers | Hand |
|--------|---------|----------|------|
| **Don** 🐰 | Moon, Sun, Crystal Ball, Jester's Hat | — | 0 |
| **Palm** 🐵 | Ted Nelson, Cosmic Awareness, Tulip, Ada Lovelace | — | 0 |
| **Bumblewick** 🎩 | Don Hopkins, Van Gogh | Impostor Syndrome, Alignment Problem | Douglas Hofstadter, LOVE |
| **Donna** 🍄 | Richard Bartle, Creativity, Will Wright | Tourist Crowd | 0 |

**Rules:** Draw 1, Play 1, Dramatic Dealer  
**Goal:** All You Need Is Love (only Love required!)

### THE SITUATION

**BUMBLEWICK HAS LOVE IN HAND!**

But he has 2 creepers. He CANNOT WIN.

If someone steals Love from his hand (with specific cards), THEY could win.

Or if Bumblewick finds a way to discard his creepers...

**Don and Palm are the only ones who CAN win** (no creepers).

But neither has Love.

## What's Next

**Turn 30 — Don Hopkins**

Critical question: Will Don draw Love?

The deck has ~220 cards. Love is in Bumblewick's hand, not the deck.

So Don CANNOT draw Love. It's already been drawn.

The only ways to get Love:
1. Steal from Bumblewick's hand (specific cards)
2. Bumblewick plays Love voluntarily (makes no sense for him)
3. Bumblewick discards Love somehow

**The game is STUCK** until someone finds a hand-stealing mechanism.

Or until the goal changes again.

*The cards are covered in signatures.*  
*The Dramatic Dealer watches.*  
*Bumblewick clutches Love and weeps.*
