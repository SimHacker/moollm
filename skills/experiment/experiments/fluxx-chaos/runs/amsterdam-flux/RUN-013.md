## The Challenge

The garden is quiet. The championship trophy (a small windmill) sits in front of Bumblewick.

Donna stands up.

"I DEMAND A REMATCH!"

---

## Donna's Terms

> "The championship was RIGGED! Tourist Crowd appeared at the WORST possible moment! I demand a PROPER tournament! Best of FIVE games! With CREEPER MANAGEMENT OPTIONS!"

### Proposed Special Rules

1. **Creeper Insurance** — Once per game, may return a creeper to deck
2. **Love Protection** — Love cannot be discarded by hand limits
3. **Tourist Management** — Tourist Crowd can be traded for another creeper

### Reactions

**Palm:** *sips espresso* "The terms are... aggressive. But entertaining."

**Don:** "I'd play another tournament. The exploration continues."

**Bumblewick:** *clutches trophy* "I... I just won. Do I have to defend already?"

## The Decision

Bumblewick looks at the windmill trophy.

He looks at Donna, fuming.

He looks at Palm, serene.

He looks at Don, curious.

"Okay," Bumblewick says quietly. "One more tournament. But can I keep the trophy during it?"

"FINE!" Donna shouts. "But when I WIN, that windmill is MINE!"

Palm sets down his espresso. "Then we play again. Tournament 2 begins."

The Cosmic Dealer materializes, shuffling.

"Same deck. Same characters. New drama. Ready?"

## To Be Continued...

*Tournament 2: "Donna's Revenge" — Coming Soon*

*The cards are shuffled. The drama continues. The windmill waits.*
