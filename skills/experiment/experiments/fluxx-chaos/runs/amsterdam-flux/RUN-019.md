# RUN-019: The Long Shot

*Bumblewick's redemption arc completes*

---

## 🏆 THE GREATEST COMEBACK IN FLUXX HISTORY 🏆

---

## Game 11: Streak Continues

### Turn 4: The Perfect Draw

Bumblewick enters Game 11 with a one-game winning streak. His Blessing gives him +1 draw.

He draws: Steal a Keeper, Trade Hands, **Chocolate**, Unicorn.

The goal is Bread and Chocolate. Palm has Bread. Don has Chocolate.

But Bumblewick has Chocolate too. AND Steal a Keeper.

> "If I steal Bread from Palm, I have Bread + Chocolate = WIN!"

**BUMBLEWICK WINS GAME 11.**

**STREAK: 2 WINS.**

> **Donna** (observing): "Two in a row. One more and he wins the tournament."

---

## Game 12: The Long Shot Game

### This Is It

**BUMBLEWICK STREAK: 2 WINS**

If Bumblewick wins Game 12, the Long Shot activates:
- 3 wins in a row = **INSTANT TOURNAMENT VICTORY**

He went from 0-8 to potentially winning a tournament in 3 games.

### Turn 1: Death Arrives

Bumblewick draws first (winner goes first).

He draws LLM, Time, Crown... and **Death** (creeper).

> "Death! NO! Not now!"

Death attaches. He can't win with a creeper.

Of course. Classic FAFO.

### Turns 2-4: The Setup

- Donna plays Simulation as a keeper
- Palm plays "AI Takes Over" as the goal (LLM + Simulation)
- **Bumblewick has LLM. Donna has Simulation. SPLIT.**

But Bumblewick has Death! Even if he got both pieces, he couldn't win!

### Turn 4: Don's Accidental Miracle

Don plays **Creeper Parade** — all creepers move clockwise!

**Death moves from Bumblewick to Donna.**

> **Bumblewick**: "Death is GONE! I'm free!"
>
> **Donna**: "OF COURSE! OF COURSE I GET DEATH NOW!"

Don then steals Simulation from Donna.

### Turn 5: The Moment

Bumblewick draws. He sees Steal a Keeper.

Don has Simulation. Bumblewick has LLM.

> "STEAL A KEEPER! I take Simulation from Don!"

**BUMBLEWICK HAS LLM AND SIMULATION!**

**NO CREEPERS!**

# 🏆🏆🏆 BUMBLEWICK WINS TOURNAMENT 3!!! 🏆🏆🏆

**THE LONG SHOT ACTIVATES!**

**3 WINS IN A ROW = INSTANT TOURNAMENT VICTORY!**

---

## The Aftermath

> **Bumblewick** (screaming): "THREE IN A ROW! THREE IN A ROW! THE LONG SHOT!"
>
> **Palm** (standing, applauding): "From 0-8 to tournament champion. Remarkable."
>
> **Don** (speechless): "He... he did it. He actually did it."
>
> **Donna** (crying): "I gave him his first win. I CREATED THIS."

## Bumblewick's Journey

| Tournament | Record | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| Tournament 1 | 0-4 | Never close |
| Tournament 2 | 0-4 | Had 8 keepers in final game, lost on turn order |
| **Tournament 3** | **3-0** | **SWEEP VIA LONG SHOT** |

**Total career record: 3-8**

But he's a champion now.

## The Three Wins

| Game | Goal | How |
|------|------|-----|
| Game 9 | All You Need Is Love | Donna's mercy play |
| Game 11 | Bread and Chocolate | Drew Chocolate + Steal a Keeper |
| Game 12 | AI Takes Over | Don's Creeper Parade freed him |

---

## Character Reflections

### Bumblewick
> "I almost gave up. After Game 8, when I had eight keepers and still lost... I thought I was cursed. But Donna showed mercy. And Don accidentally helped me. I'm not the best player. But I'm a champion now."

### Donna
> "I created a monster. I gave him his first win out of pity, and now he's a tournament champion. ...I don't regret it. He needed it more than I needed another trophy."

### Palm
> "I won Tournament 2 on turn order. Bumblewick won Tournament 3 on a Long Shot streak. Fluxx rewards chaos. Sometimes the one who keeps trying finally catches a break."

### Don
> "If Bumblewick can come back from 0-8, I can come back from anything. Tournament 4?"

## The Final Scene

Four players sit around the table, cards scattered everywhere. Empty espresso cups. Chocolate stains. Creeper cards face-down.

Bumblewick holds an imaginary trophy above his head.
Donna rolls her eyes but smiles.
Palm takes notes for future analysis.
Don is already shuffling for the next game.

Outside the café window, an Amsterdam sunset.
Inside, four characters who learned that in Fluxx, anything can happen.

**Especially when you least expect it.**
