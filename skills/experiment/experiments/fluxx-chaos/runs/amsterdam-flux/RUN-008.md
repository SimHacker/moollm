**Draw Phase (Draw 3 + Chaos):** Bumblewick draws **👤 Richard Bartle**, **💡 Creativity**, **🎴 Steal a Keeper**

Bumblewick still has "All You Need Is Love" goal in hand.

Donna has Love. If Bumblewick plays this goal...

*Bumblewick's eyes light up:*
> "Wait. WAIT. Donna has Love in hand. If I play this goal... — B.F."

But Donna also has Tourist Crowd creeper! If the creeper triggers before she plays Love...

"It's a gamble," Bumblewick mutters. "But I have nothing to lose."

**Play Phase:**

**Bumblewick plays: ❤️ ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE!**

**NEW GOAL: ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE**  
*Requires: ONLY Love!*

The table gasps.

Donna looks at her hand: Love, Tourist Crowd.

**IF DONNA PLAYS LOVE RIGHT NOW, SHE WINS THE CHAMPIONSHIP!**

But it's not Donna's turn...

*Bumblewick signs the goal:*
> "This is either brilliant or catastrophic. Probably both. — B.F. 🎩"

**Bumblewick's Keepers:** Richard Bartle

### Turn 13 — Donna Toadstool 🍄

**THE MOMENT OF TRUTH!**

**Draw Phase (Draw 3 + Chaos):** Donna draws...

**📜 HAND LIMIT 4** (New Rule)

Oh no.

Donna's hand is: Love, Tourist Crowd, Will Wright, + this new card (Hand Limit 4)

That's 4 cards. The hand limit is... 4.

But wait — she drew 3 cards due to Draw 3 rule!

Donna draws: **Hand Limit 4**, **🎨 Art Gallery** (Action), **🎭 Mind Games** (Action)

Hand is now: Love, Tourist Crowd, Will Wright, Hand Limit 4, Art Gallery, Mind Games = **6 cards!**

If she plays Hand Limit 4, she'll have to discard down to 4!

*Donna panics:*
> "No no no no NO! — DT 🍄"

**Play Phase (Play 2):**

Donna COULD play Love immediately and WIN!

But... rules state play phase comes AFTER hand limit enforcement?

Wait, no — she just drew the Hand Limit card. It's not active yet.

**Donna plays: ❤️ LOVE!**

Wait — can she? She has to play 2 cards (Play 2 rule).

**Donna plays: ❤️ LOVE!**

**DONNA HAS LOVE IN PLAY!**  
**GOAL IS ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE!**  
**DONNA WINS—**

No wait. She ALSO has Tourist Crowd in hand.

Creepers have a special rule: **You must play creepers immediately when drawn.**

Donna drew Tourist Crowd back on Turn 4 but... no, she had it from the DEAL.

Creepers in the deal... wait, let me check the rules.

*Checking Fluxx rules...*

Actually, creepers drawn during the draw phase must be played immediately. But creepers dealt at game start... can be held?

No — standard Fluxx rules: **Creepers must be played immediately whenever they enter your hand.**

Donna has been ILLEGALLY holding Tourist Crowd since the deal!

The Chaotic Dealer intervenes: "Correction. Tourist Crowd should have been played immediately. Retconning Turn 4."

---

## RETCON — The Creeper Problem

*The Cosmic Dealer pauses the game.*

"Wait. Let me check the original deal. Donna received Tourist Crowd at the START of Game 3."

Standard Fluxx rules: Creepers are played immediately when received, even during the deal.

**CORRECTION:** At game start, Donna should have played Tourist Crowd immediately.

**Revised Game 3 Start:**
- Donna receives Tourist Crowd in deal → auto-plays to her tableau
- Donna has been BLOCKED since Turn 1
- Her keeper Love is still valid, but she CAN'T WIN with a creeper

---

## Corrected Turn 13 — Donna Toadstool 🍄

Donna ALREADY HAS Tourist Crowd attached (since Turn 1, corrected).

Her hand is: Love, Will Wright, + new draws

**Draw Phase (Draw 3):** Donna draws **Hand Limit 4**, **Art Gallery**, **Mind Games**

Hand: Love, Will Wright, Hand Limit 4, Art Gallery, Mind Games = 5 cards

**Play Phase (Play 2):**

Donna COULD play Love... but she has Tourist Crowd creeper attached!

**SHE CAN'T WIN!**

"AAARGH!" Donna screams. "I have the winning card! I have the WINNING CARD and I CAN'T USE IT!"

*Donna signs Love with fury:*
> "I thought I had it. I thought wrong. — DT 🍄 😭"

**Donna plays: 📜 HAND LIMIT 4**

**NEW RULE: Hand Limit 4**

Donna must discard to 4 cards.

Donna discards: **Love** (to the discard pile)

"I can't use it anyway," Donna sobs. "Let someone else have it."

**❤️ LOVE ENTERS THE DISCARD PILE!**

Donna also plays: Art Gallery (action)
