    Every turn matters.
    No elision. No skipping.
    The chaos unfolds moment by moment.
    
    Don is one turn from victory.
    Three players must stop him.
    
    Let's see what the deck has to say.

narrative_threads:
  don_victory: |
    Don finally won a tournament.
    Cookies delivered. Silent victory learned.
    
    But the FAFO Token trapped him afterward.
    Having the winning combo meant nothing with a creeper.
    
  palm_ascendant: |
    Palm won Game 20 with a clutch Creeper Sweeper.
    Now carries the FAFO Token but knows the rules.
    
    Leading Tournament 5 at 1-0.
    
  bumblewick_hope: |
    Underdog's Blessing returned!
    The card recognizes its owner.
    
    But the blessing only works when you have the FEWEST keepers.
    Bumblewick needs to stay behind to get ahead.
    
  the_token_paradox: |
    The FAFO Token isn't just about gloating.
    It's a creeper. It prevents winning.
    
    Don had Milk & Cookies but couldn't win.
    The only escape: let someone else win and take the Token.
    
    A strange game. The only winning move is... to lose first?
