# Status: FAILED — Full card UI overlay
# Action: REGENERATE with simplified prompt

mining_date: "2026-01-24"
image_file: "12-music.png"
status: "FAILED"
failure_reason: "Full card UI overlay rendered in image"

observed_issues:
  - type: "card_ui_overlay"
    description: "Complete card frame with title 'Sunburst Serenade'"
  - type: "game_text"
    description: "Cost, Card Type, Effect text, Flavor Text boxes"
  - type: "stats_display"
    description: "Performance tokens, dice roll mechanics visible"

what_was_requested:
  - "Pure artwork of electric guitar"
  - "Still life painting style"
  - "No UI elements"

what_was_generated:
  - "Guitar itself is well-rendered (sunburst Les Paul)"
  - "But overlaid with complete card game interface"
  - "Text includes gibberish game mechanics"

lesson_learned: |
  The prompt mentioned "board game card art" which the generator
  interpreted as "make it look like a complete game card" rather
  than "use that illustration style for the artwork".
  
  Simplify: describe only the subject and painting style,
  remove all references to cards or games.
