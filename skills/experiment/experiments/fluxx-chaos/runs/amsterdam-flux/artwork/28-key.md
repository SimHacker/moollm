## The Image

An ornate skeleton key catches dramatic side light, its brass surface showing the patina of age and importance. The bow is elaborately worked — scrolls and flourishes that suggest this key opens something that matters.

The long shaft ends in intricate wards, the teeth that will find their matching lock. This is not a key to an ordinary door — it's the key to secrets, to treasure, to places that stay hidden until the right person arrives.

Light traces the edges, creating a glow that suggests the key itself knows its importance.

## The Feel

Access and secrets. The power of opening what others cannot. The promise that somewhere, there's a lock waiting for this key.

## The Style

Digital illustration in board game card art style. Warm brass tones, dramatic lighting, that antique mystery aesthetic. The key as symbol of access, displayed with reverence.

*Pure visual art, silent scene, antique key as portrait.*
