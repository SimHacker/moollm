what_was_requested:
  - "Stack of leather-bound books"
  - "Library atmosphere"
  - "Pure artwork"

what_was_generated:
  - "Books are beautiful — varied leather colors"
  - "Brass desk lamp — nice touch"
  - "One open book at base — good composition"
  - "BUT split-screen card layout with UI panels"

composition_analysis:
  books_quality: "excellent — rich textures, gold details"
  lamp: "adds warm library atmosphere"
  layout: "image split between books (top) and card UI (bottom)"
  ruined_by: "card game interface panels"

lesson_learned: |
  Same recurring issue — "board game" triggers card UI.
  Also, books inherently have text on spines.
  May need to specify "blank spines" or accept decorative patterns.
