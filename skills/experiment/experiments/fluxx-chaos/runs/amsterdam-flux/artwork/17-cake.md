## The Image

A magnificent birthday cake rises in tiers of fluffy frosting, each layer a different pastel dream. Lit candles cast warm dancing light across the swirled peaks of buttercream, making the whole confection glow like a delicious beacon of celebration.

Rainbow sprinkles catch the light like edible confetti. The frosting work shows skill and love — roses piped at the borders, smooth sweeps up the sides. This is the centerpiece of every party, the monument to another year survived.

The candles flicker with that particular warmth that only exists at birthday tables, that moment before the wish.

## The Feel

Pure celebration. The sweetness of ritual joy. That moment when everyone gathers around and sings badly but means it completely.

## The Style

Digital illustration in board game card art style. Warm candlelit colors, pastel frosting tones, that inviting food illustration quality. The cake as hero, centered and glowing.

*Pure visual art, silent scene, celebration confection as portrait.*
