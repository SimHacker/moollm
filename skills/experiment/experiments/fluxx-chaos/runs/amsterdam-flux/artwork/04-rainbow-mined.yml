# LAYER 1: COMPOSITION ANALYSIS
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

layer_1_composition:
  name: "Composition Analysis"
  relevance: "Diagonal arc creates dynamic tension"
  
  observations:
    rainbow_arc:
      orientation: "Diagonal from upper-left to lower-right"
      coverage: "Spans full frame, both ends visible"
      shape: "Classic semicircle, perfectly curved"
      
    cloud_drama:
      storm_clouds: "Dark grey masses upper-center and right"
      friendly_clouds: "Bright white cumulus lower-left"
      contrast: "Maximum — dark vs bright in single frame"
      
    light_source:
      position: "Upper-right, breaking through cloud gap"
      god_rays: "Dramatic light shafts angle down through scene"
      quality: "Golden hour, volumetric, theatrical"
      
  framing:
    rainbow_as_bridge: "Connects dark past (storm) to bright future (light)"
    visual_story: "Storm retreating right, hope emerging left"
    balance: "Asymmetric but stable — weight on dark side balanced by rainbow"
    
  prompt_adherence: "95% — all elements present, slightly more diagonal than expected"
  
  notes: |
    The diagonal rainbow is actually more dynamic than a flat arc.
    It creates movement, suggests the rainbow is still forming,
    adds visual tension. Happy accident that improves on the brief.

# LAYER 2: COLOR PALETTE ANALYSIS
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

layer_2_color:
  name: "Color Palette Analysis"
  relevance: "Rainbow colors are the whole point — did they nail it?"
  
  observations:
    rainbow_bands:
      red: "Outermost, rich and saturated"
      orange: "Bright and distinct"
      yellow: "Luminous, almost glowing"
      green: "Fresh spring green, well-separated"
      blue: "Sky blue, blends toward indigo"
      indigo: "Visible but subtle — hardest band"
      violet: "Innermost, purple-pink"
      
    band_quality:
      saturation: "High — colors pop against grey clouds"
      separation: "Clear distinctions, no muddy blending"
      width: "Roughly equal, proper proportions"
      
    environmental_colors:
      storm_clouds: "Blue-grey, slate, charcoal"
      cumulus: "Pure white with subtle warm highlights"
      sky_break: "Pale blue, washed clean"
      god_rays: "Golden-cream, warm and inviting"
      
  color_story:
    before: "Cool greys of storm"
    during: "Saturated rainbow spectrum"
    after: "Warm golden light of hope"
    
  notes: |
    The rainbow colors are perfectly Roy G. Biv. Saturated enough
    to read clearly but not so neon they lose painterly quality.
    The grey clouds make the rainbow POP — excellent contrast choice.

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# LAYER 3: EMOTIONAL TELLS
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

layer_3_emotional:
  name: "Emotional Tells"
  relevance: "Rainbow = hope. Did the image capture that feeling?"
  
  observations:
    hope_indicators:
      light_breaking_through: "Sun emerging is visual proof storm is ending"
      rainbow_presence: "The promise made visible"
      bright_clouds: "Future is literally brighter"
      
    storm_past:
      dark_clouds_retreating: "Storm isn't gone but is GOING"
      weight_of_weather: "You can feel the heaviness lifting"
      rain_implied: "Air still heavy, droplets still falling"
      
    emotional_journey:
      - "Start eye on dark clouds — the difficult"
      - "Follow rainbow arc — the bridge"
      - "End on light rays — the hopeful"
      - "Visual narrative of overcoming"
      
    specific_feelings:
      relief: "The storm didn't last forever"
      wonder: "Rainbows are always magical"
      promise: "Good things follow difficult things"
      
  storybook_quality:
    - "This could illustrate 'after the rain' in a children's book"
    - "Hopeful without being saccharine"
    - "Dramatic but not scary"
    
  notes: |
    The emotional arc of the image matches the emotional arc of
    experiencing a real rainbow. The storm was real (dark clouds
    prove it), the relief is real (light proves it), the rainbow
    is the moment between — the pivot from difficulty to hope.
