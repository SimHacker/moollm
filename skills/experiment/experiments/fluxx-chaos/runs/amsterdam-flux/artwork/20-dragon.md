## The Image

A magnificent dragon coils in regal pose, emerald scales gleaming like a fortune in gemstones. Its wings spread partially, membranes catching firelight in translucent amber. Golden eyes regard the viewer with ancient intelligence — not malice, but the patient assessment of a creature that has seen civilizations rise and fall.

A subtle glow emanates from within, the suggestion of fire waiting in the belly. Each scale is a perfect overlap of natural armor, catching light differently, creating that characteristic dragon shimmer.

This is power contained, wisdom ancient, danger beautiful.

## The Feel

Awe and danger balanced perfectly. The magnificent terror of something that could destroy you but chooses, for now, not to. The collector's ultimate prize.

## The Style

Digital illustration in board game card art style. Rich emerald greens, fire glow oranges, treasure gold accents. The dragon as mythical portrait, commanding and regal.

*Pure visual art, silent scene, fantasy creature as portrait.*
