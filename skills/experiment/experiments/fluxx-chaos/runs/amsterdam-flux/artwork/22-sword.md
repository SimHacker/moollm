## The Image

A legendary sword hangs vertical against stone, blade catching light in a perfect silver line. The steel gleams with that particular quality that says "this was forged by masters" — not factory perfect, but alive with the hammer's memory.

The crossguard spreads like wings. The grip is wrapped leather, worn smooth by heroic hands. The pommel holds a single gem that might be magical or might just be very, very fine craftsmanship. Faint runes trace down the blade, barely visible, suggesting power held in reserve.

This is the sword that waits in stones, that chooses its wielder, that ends stories and begins them.

## The Feel

Destiny made steel. The heroic potential waiting for the right hand. Not violence for its own sake, but the tool of those who must stand against darkness.

## The Style

Digital illustration in board game card art style. Silver steel, warm gold hilt, the cold beauty of a weapon made art. The sword as heroic object, displayed with reverence.

*Pure visual art, silent scene, legendary weapon as portrait.*
