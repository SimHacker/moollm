## The Image

A beautiful retro CRT television set sits in warm ambient light, its screen glowing with colorful static — the visual snow that once meant possibility, channels to explore, worlds to discover.

The wood-grain cabinet speaks of a time when technology lived in furniture. Chunky channel knobs catch highlights. The curved glass screen bulges slightly, that characteristic CRT curvature that modern screens have forgotten.

This is television as ritual object — the hearth of the modern home, the family gathering point, the window to elsewhere.

## The Feel

Nostalgic warmth. The comfort of evening entertainment rituals. Not the cold efficiency of streaming, but the warm anticipation of "what's on tonight?"

## The Style

Digital illustration in board game card art style. Warm colors dominate — ambers, oranges, the cozy glow of screen light in a dim room. The TV as beloved object, centered and heroic.

*Pure visual art, silent scene, retro technology as portrait.*
