# The Rainbow — Visual Prose Prompt (YANG)

## The Scene

The storm has passed. Where moments ago the sky was iron-grey and weeping, now a break appears in the clouds — a crack in the heavens through which golden afternoon light pours like honey.

And there, spanning the sky in a perfect arc of color, rises the rainbow.

## The Rainbow Itself

Seven bands of color sweep across the sky in that impossible, precise order: red at the outermost edge, the color of strawberries and cardinals, blending seamlessly into orange like marmalade held to the light, then yellow bright as dandelions, then the fresh green of spring leaves, melting into blue deep as summer sky, then indigo like twilight, and finally violet at the inner edge, the color of wildflowers and magic.

The colors don't have hard edges — they blend and flow into each other, each band wide enough to appreciate, the full spectrum on display. The arc is perfectly curved, mathematical in its precision yet natural in its beauty.

## The Sky Around It

Behind the rainbow, storm clouds retreat — dark purples and greys in tumbled masses, still muttering with the last of the thunder. But the clouds are parting like stage curtains, and through the gap the sky is that particular washed-clean blue that only appears after rain.

The sun, low in the west, sends dramatic shafts of light through the cloud breaks. God-rays angle down through the moisture-laden air, catching every lingering droplet, making the whole sky sparkle.

Below the rainbow, friendly cumulus clouds — white and fluffy, newly innocent — pile like cotton balls. One end of the rainbow seems to descend behind these clouds, promising that legendary pot of gold just out of sight.

## Light and Atmosphere

The light has that specific after-rain quality: crystal clear, every color intensified. The rainbow's bands seem to glow from within, luminous against the darker sky behind. Small raindrops still falling catch the light like scattered diamonds.

The air feels fresh, electric with that petrichor scent of wet earth and ozone. You can almost feel the cool breeze that carries the last of the rain away.

## Mood and Meaning

This is the rainbow of hope fulfilled. The storm was real — you can see its retreating darkness — but it has passed. The rainbow is the promise made visible, the visual proof that difficult times end and beauty emerges.

It's whimsical without being childish. Hopeful without being naive. A rainbow painted by someone who has weathered storms and still believes in the colors that follow.

## Style Direction

Bright, bold colors with a painterly quality. The rainbow bands should pop with saturated hues while the surrounding sky maintains depth and drama. Looney Labs whimsy applied to a nature scene — joyful, collectible, the kind of image that makes you smile. Pure visual art with no text, words, or typography of any kind.
