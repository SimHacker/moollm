# Milk — Visual Prose Prompt (YANG)

## The Glass

A tall glass stands on the counter, filled nearly to the brim with milk.

Not skim milk, not almond milk, not any substitute. Real milk. Whole milk. The kind your grandmother poured.

## The Milk Itself

Pure, opaque white fills the glass — the white of clouds, of snow, of fresh sheets. This is the color that defines the word "milk." Creamy, rich, substantial.

At the surface, tiny bubbles cling where the liquid settles, evidence that this glass was just poured. The milk has weight, presence. You can almost feel how cold it would be against your lips, how it would coat your tongue with that distinctive clean richness.

Where the milk meets the glass, a gentle meniscus curves — physics made visible. The milk doesn't just sit in the glass; it embraces it.

## The Glass

Clear glass, classic tumbler shape. Not fancy, not ornate — the kind of glass that lives in every kitchen cabinet in the world. Functional. Perfect.

Through the glass, you can see the milk isn't quite uniform — there are subtle variations, lighter near the glass edge where light passes through, richer and more opaque in the center. The glass acts as a lens, showing you the milk from multiple angles at once.

At the rim, the glass has that slight thickness that good glassware has. At the base, a solid foundation. This is a glass that has seen many breakfasts, many bedtimes, many cookies dunked.

## The Condensation

This is the detail that sells it: droplets of water beading on the outside of the glass. The milk is COLD. Refrigerator cold. Ice-cold-in-July cold.

Some droplets are round and proud, catching light like tiny lenses. Others have begun to run, creating tracks down the glass's surface. One or two have reached the counter, leaving wet rings that catch the light.

This condensation says: drink me now. I'm at the perfect temperature. I won't stay this cold forever.

## The Light

Clean, bright light falls from the left, creating a highlight on the glass that runs from top to bottom — that classic cylinder reflection that photographers spend hours perfecting.

The milk surface catches light too, a soft sheen that says "smooth" and "fresh." Where the condensation droplets sit, each one becomes a tiny spotlight, a miniature sun.

The background is soft, unfocused, irrelevant. All attention stays on the glass.

## The Feeling

This is the milk that goes with cookies. The milk that means bedtime when you're small and simple pleasure when you're grown. The milk that does a body good.

Looking at this image should make you thirsty. Should make you think about chocolate chip cookies fresh from the oven. Should make you feel, just for a moment, like everything is simple and good.

## Style Direction

Clean and appetizing. Food photography meets fine art illustration. The milk should look drinkable, the glass should look holdable. Bold but not cartoonish — realistic enough to be appetizing, stylized enough to be collectible. Visible brushwork in the background, crisp detail on the glass.

**CRITICAL:** This is a standalone painting — pure artwork only. Absolutely no text anywhere. No titles, no labels, no branding, no card frames, no flavor text, no UI elements of any kind. Just the glass of milk like a still life painting that could hang in a kitchen. Silent image, no words.
