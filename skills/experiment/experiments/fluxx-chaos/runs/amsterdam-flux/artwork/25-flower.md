## The Image

A perfect flower opens to morning light, petals unfurling in layers of blushing pink that deepen toward the center. Dewdrops cling like tiny crystals, each one catching and refracting light into rainbow sparkles.

The petals layer with that impossible organic geometry that no artist could invent — each one slightly different, slightly overlapping, creating depth that draws the eye inward toward the golden heart where pollen waits for its purpose.

The background falls away in soft green bokeh, the suggestion of garden without distraction from this perfect specimen.

## The Feel

Beauty in its most concentrated form. The fleeting perfection of living things. The gift of something that exists only to be beautiful.

## The Style

Digital illustration in board game card art style with botanical illustration influence. Soft pinks, organic greens, that morning freshness. The flower as portrait of beauty itself.

*Pure visual art, silent scene, botanical beauty as portrait.*
