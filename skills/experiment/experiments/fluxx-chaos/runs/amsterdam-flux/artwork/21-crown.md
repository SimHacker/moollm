## The Image

A magnificent royal crown rests upon a velvet cushion, gold gleaming with the weight of authority. Rubies the color of old blood catch light at the peaks, sapphires deep as ocean trenches anchor the band. The metalwork is intricate — filigree and flourishes that speak of master craftsmen laboring for months.

The crown's interior shows crimson velvet, worn smooth by the heads of generations. This object has witnessed coronations and depositions, has sat heavy on troubled brows.

Light catches each facet of the gems, each curve of gold, creating a small galaxy of sparkles.

## The Feel

Authority. The heavy responsibility of power. The allure of sovereignty that has driven humans to terrible and wonderful acts.

## The Style

Digital illustration in board game card art style. Rich golds, royal purples, gem colors popping. The crown as symbol of power, centered on its cushion like an altar.

*Pure visual art, silent scene, royal regalia as portrait.*
