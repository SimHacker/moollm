## The Image

A magnificent silver rocket ship blasts upward against a star-scattered cosmic canvas, its chrome body gleaming with reflections of its own fiery exhaust. This is no modern utilitarian spacecraft — this is the rocket of DREAMS, the kind that adorned lunchboxes and pulp magazine covers in the 1950s.

The rocket is pure retro-futurism: a sleek pointed nose cone, a tapered body with three bold red stabilizer fins, and a row of porthole windows along the side. The design says "the future will be ELEGANT" — all swept lines and optimistic chrome.

Thrust blazes from the engine cone in brilliant orange and yellow, trailing into a long exhaust plume that fades from white-hot to orange to red as it stretches behind the ship. Launch smoke swirls at the base of the frame, suggesting the rocket has JUST lifted off.

The Moon hangs in the upper portion of the sky — clearly visible, clearly the destination. Stars are everywhere: white pinpoints against the deep blue-black of space, with hints of distant nebulae adding purple and pink washes to the cosmic background.

The curve of Earth is visible at the very bottom edge — we're leaving home, reaching for something greater.

## The Feel

This image should evoke:
- **Wonder** — the childhood dream of going to space
- **Adventure** — this is the BEGINNING of something amazing
- **Optimism** — the future is bright and chrome and waiting
- **Achievement** — someone built this, it's GOING

The rocket isn't realistic — it's idealized. It's the rocket from your imagination when you were eight years old, lying in the grass looking up at the stars.

## The Style

- Modern board game illustration with clean bold lines
- Retro-futurism: 1950s space age aesthetic
- Rich, saturated colors against deep space blacks
- Chrome and silver with bold red accents
- Dramatic lighting from the engine thrust
- Professional illustration quality

## ⚠️ CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS — PURE ARTWORK ONLY

**This is JUST the illustration — like art that goes inside a card frame.**

- NO card borders, frames, UI elements, or game chrome
- NO badges, icons, overlays, or info boxes
