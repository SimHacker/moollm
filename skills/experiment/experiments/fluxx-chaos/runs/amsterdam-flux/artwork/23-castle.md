## The Image

A magnificent fairy tale castle rises from its hilltop, spires reaching toward a sunset-painted sky. The warm stone walls glow golden in the last light, while tiny lights begin to twinkle in windows — life inside, warmth waiting.

Flags snap in an unseen breeze atop every tower. The architecture is impossible in the best way — too many turrets, too many balconies, the kind of castle that could only exist in stories and board games.

This is where adventures begin or end, where quests are given and rewards claimed.

## The Feel

The promise of adventure and the comfort of home base. Safety behind strong walls. The fairy tale destination that every hero seeks.

## The Style

Digital illustration in board game card art style. Warm sunset colors, the golden stone of fantasy architecture. The castle as destination, centered and inviting.

*Pure visual art, silent scene, fantasy architecture as portrait.*
