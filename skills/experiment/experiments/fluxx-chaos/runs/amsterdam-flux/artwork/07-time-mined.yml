# LAYER 1: VERMEER LIGHTING ANALYSIS

layer_1_lighting:
  name: "Vermeer Lighting Analysis"
  relevance: "Dramatic side light defines the piece"
  
  observations:
    light_shaft:
      angle: "Diagonal from upper left, ~45 degrees"
      quality: "Sharp-edged beam, window-shaped"
      coverage: "Cuts across clock face and body"
      color: "Warm golden, afternoon sun"
      
    illuminated_zones:
      clock_face: "Partially lit — dramatic half-light"
      wood_grain: "Light reveals texture in grain"
      brass_fittings: "Catch light and glow"
      pendulum_glass: "Subtle reflections"
      
    shadow_zones:
      clock_body_right: "Deep shadow on right side"
      room_beyond: "Dark, suggestive of deeper space"
      under_hood: "Crown area in shadow"
      
    vermeer_qualities:
      side_lighting: "Classic Dutch Golden Age technique"
      pools_of_light: "Light isn't even — it pools"
      mystery_in_shadow: "Shadows hide, light reveals"
      
  art_historical_note: |
    This lighting is straight out of Vermeer's playbook. The window
    is off-frame but its presence is undeniable. The light tells you
    what time of day it is (afternoon), what direction you're facing
    (window to the left), and adds dramatic weight to a simple subject.
  
  notes: |
    The diagonal light shaft across the clock face is the money shot.
    It would be a good clock illustration without it. WITH the light,
    it's art. The light makes you FEEL time passing.

# LAYER 2: CRAFTSMANSHIP DETAIL

layer_2_craftsmanship:
  name: "Craftsmanship Detail"
  relevance: "Victorian grandfather clock = visible craftsmanship"
  
  observations:
    clock_face:
      numerals: "Roman numerals, properly oriented"
      center: "Ornate brass with filigree pattern"
      hands: "Black metal, elegant shapes"
      time_shown: "~10:08 or so — organic, not 10:10"
      surround: "Decorative frame with scrollwork"
      
    wood_construction:
      body: "Rich mahogany/walnut, visible grain"
      hood: "Bonnet top with finials"
      base: "Lower cabinet with glass window"
      inlays: "Lighter wood accents create pattern"
      
    brass_elements:
      hinges: "Visible on glass doors"
      keyhole: "Winding mechanism visible"
      pendulum: "Classic lyre shape, golden"
      finials: "Small decorative tops on hood"
      
    carving_details:
      scrollwork: "Organic flourishes on body"
      columns: "Fluted pilasters on sides"
      moldings: "Crown and base moldings visible"
      
    period_accuracy:
      style: "Victorian/Edwardian grandfather clock"
      authenticity: "Details are correct for period"
      craftsmanship_implied: "This took time to make — ironic"
      
  notes: |
    The level of detail implies value, history, human effort.
    Someone carved those scrolls. Someone fit those hinges.
    Someone winds this clock. Time represented by the accumulated
    time it took to make the timekeeper.

# LAYER 3: ENVIRONMENTAL STORYTELLING

layer_3_environment:
  name: "Environmental Storytelling"
  relevance: "Where is this clock? What does that tell us?"
  
  observations:
    room_context:
      window: "Suggested left, source of light"
      pull_cord: "Window blind cord visible far left"
      wall: "Plain cream/grey, simple elegance"
      books: "Stack visible lower left — library/study"
      
    implied_space:
      type: "Study, library, or formal parlor"
      class: "Upper middle — this is expensive furniture"
      era: "Timeless — could be 1880 or 1980"
      mood: "Quiet, contemplative, slightly formal"
      
    lifestyle_hints:
      books: "Someone reads here"
      grandfather_clock: "Family heirloom, generational"
      care: "Clock is maintained, polished, wound"
      
    narrative_elements:
      - "Window cord suggests everyday life"
      - "Books suggest intellectual life"
      - "Clock suggests measured, regulated life"
      - "All together: a life well-organized"
      
  mood_created:
    quiet: "This room doesn't see loud parties"
    contemplative: "A place for thinking"
    traditional: "Old ways, old values, old furniture"
    timeless: "Ironically, the room about time is timeless"
    
  notes: |
    The environmental details are subtle but powerful. This isn't
    a clock in a store — it's a clock in a HOME. It has a place,
    a life, a family. The blind cord, the books, the wall color —
    these details say "someone lives here and cares about time."
