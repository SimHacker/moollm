## 30. War

![War](30-war.png)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Deck** | Fluxx 4.0 |
| **Type** | Creeper 💀 |
| **Symbol** | ⚔️💀 |

### What It Does

**Creepers** are bad news. Unlike Keepers, you **don't want** Creepers. They prevent you from winning.

War has a special ability: it **attaches to Peace**. If you have Peace and draw War, War corrupts it. You can't win with the "Peace and Bread" goal while War is attached to your Peace.

The only way to win with War is if the current Goal specifically requires it (like "War Equals Death").

*"War is a Creeper. It attaches to Peace and destroys it."*

---

## 31. Death

![Death](31-death.png)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Deck** | Fluxx 4.0 |
| **Type** | Creeper 💀 |
| **Symbol** | 💀 |

### What It Does

Death is the ultimate Creeper. It **prevents victory** and has the power to **destroy Keepers**.

When Death is in front of you, you cannot win (unless the Goal requires Death). Some cards let Death destroy other players' Keepers — the Grim Reaper takes what it wants.

The only "good" news: some Goals like "War Equals Death" specifically need Creepers to win.

*"Death comes for us all."*

---

## Understanding The Game

### How Fluxx Works

Fluxx is a card game where the rules constantly change. You start with:
- **Draw 1, Play 1** — draw one card, play one card

But "New Rule" cards change everything:
- Draw 5? Play All? Hand Limit 0? 
- The rules shift constantly

### Winning

To win, you need to match the current **Goal**. Goals require specific combinations of Keepers:
- "Milk and Cookies" = Milk + Cookies
- "Rocket to the Moon" = Rocket + Moon
- "Peace and Bread" = Peace + Bread

But there's always only one Goal at a time — and anyone can change it.

### The Chaos

This is why Fluxx is chaos:
- You might be one card away from winning
- Someone plays a new Goal
- Now you need completely different Keepers
- And you just drew a Creeper

Welcome to Fluxx. Welcome to chaos.
