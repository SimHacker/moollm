## The Image

A magnificent ancient tree dominates the scene, its massive trunk twisted by centuries of growth into a sculpture of patient strength. The canopy spreads wide enough to shelter a village, leaves catching sunlight and glowing that particular green that means life.

Gnarled roots grip the earth like fingers, some breaking the surface, creating natural alcoves. The bark tells stories in its cracks and whorls — faces almost visible if you look right, the memories of every creature that ever rested in its shade.

Dappled light filters through, creating pools of gold on the ground beneath.

## The Feel

Ancient wisdom. Patient strength. The comfort of something that will outlive your problems. Connection to earth and sky, the axis mundi of the natural world.

## The Style

Digital illustration in board game card art style. Rich organic greens, warm bark browns, golden filtered light. The tree as wise elder, centered and commanding.

*Pure visual art, silent scene, nature as portrait.*
