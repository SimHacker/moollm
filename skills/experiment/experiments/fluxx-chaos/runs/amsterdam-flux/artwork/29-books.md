## The Image

A carefully arranged stack of leather-bound books rises in warm lamplight, each volume a different size and color of leather — deep burgundy, forest green, rich brown. Gold decorative patterns trace the spines, catching light like quiet treasure.

One book lies open at the base, cream pages fanned to show that these are not just decorative — they contain worlds. The paper has that particular thickness of quality printing, edges slightly worn from turning.

This is knowledge made material, adventure compressed into portable form.

## The Feel

Intellectual warmth. The comfort of reading. The promise that within these covers lie answers, adventures, escapes, and truths.

## The Style

Digital illustration in board game card art style. Rich leather tones, warm lamp light, that library aesthetic of comfortable knowledge. The book stack as portal to elsewhere.

*Pure visual art, silent scene, books as portrait of knowledge.*
