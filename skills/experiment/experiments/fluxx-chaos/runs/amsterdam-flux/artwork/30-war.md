## The Image

Two dark blades cross in an X over a bleached skull, the universal symbol of conflict and death. The swords are not heroic — they're tools of destruction, pitted and worn, steel the color of storm clouds.

The skull grins its eternal grin beneath them, the inevitable result of the blades' purpose. Behind, dark smoke roils, lit from below by suggestion of fire — cities burning, fields salted, the aftermath of what these swords represent.

This is the Creeper that attaches to Peace, corrupting it. The unwanted card that blocks victory.

## The Feel

Dread. The weight of conflict. The understanding that this card arriving is never good news.

## The Style

Digital illustration in board game card art style with creeper overlay — darker palette, ominous mood, "get this away from me" energy. The symbol of war as portrait of destruction.

*Pure visual art, silent scene, creeper symbol as portrait.*
