layer_1_composition:
  name: "Visual Structure"
  observations:
    focal_point: "wireframe Earth globe, lower center"
    upper_elements: "neural network diagram with icons"
    background: "deep space black with matrix rain"
    lighting: "self-illuminating cyan glow"

layer_2_technical:
  name: "Technical Analysis"
  observations:
    globe_style: "holographic wireframe, latitude/longitude lines"
    data_visualization:
      - "hexagonal icons (brain, eye, lightbulb, circuit)"
      - "connecting lines in orange/pink gradient"
      - "green data streams flowing rightward"
    matrix_effect: "vertical cyan/green character rain"

layer_3_symbolism:
  name: "Semantic Content"
  observations:
    simulation_hypothesis: "Earth as computed construct"
    ai_network: "neural nodes suggesting machine cognition"
    icons_meaning:
      brain: "artificial intelligence"
      eye: "surveillance/observation"
      circuit: "computational substrate"
      lightbulb: "ideas/emergence"
    philosophical_depth: "high — 'are we in a simulation?'"

quality_assessment:
  text_present: false
  ui_elements: false  # icons are semantic, not UI
  frame_issues: false
  overall: "Perfect tech-mystical hybrid for MOOLLM"
