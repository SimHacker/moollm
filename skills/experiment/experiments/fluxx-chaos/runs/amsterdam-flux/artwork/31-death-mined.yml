mining_date: "2026-01-24"
image_file: "31-death.png"
status: "FAILED"
failure_reason: "Rounded card frame border around image"

observed_issues:
  - type: "card_frame"
    description: "rounded rectangle frame cutting off edges"
  - type: "white_corners"
    description: "white background visible in corners"
  - type: "portrait_aspect"
    description: "vertical card shape, not square"
  - type: "shadow_escape"
    description: "dark wisps extend beyond frame awkwardly"

what_was_requested:
  - "Grim Reaper figure"
  - "Hooded skull with scythe"
  - "Pure artwork"

what_was_generated:
  - "Reaper is excellent — hooded skull, glowing eyes"
  - "Scythe well-rendered"
  - "Swirling blue vortex background — dramatic"
  - "BUT framed as a card with rounded corners"

composition_analysis:
  reaper_quality: "excellent — classic design, glowing cyan eyes"
  robes: "tattered, flowing, made of shadow"
  scythe: "long wooden handle, curved blade"
  background: "swirling blue/black vortex — perfect"
  ruined_by: "card frame cutting into the art"

lesson_learned: |
  Card frame issue persists. The art itself is great but
  was generated as a "card" not as "artwork".
  Regenerate with pure painting language.
