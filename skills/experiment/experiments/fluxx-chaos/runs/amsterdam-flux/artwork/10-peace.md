# Peace — Visual Prose Prompt (YANG)

## The Symbol

There it is. The most recognized symbol of the twentieth century, after perhaps only the cross and the crescent.

A circle. A vertical line from top to bottom. Two lines angling down from the center to meet the circle at its lower corners. Simple geometry that says everything.

The peace symbol.

## The Form

The symbol floats in space, not drawn on a surface but existing as a thing in itself. It has dimension — not thick like a coin, but present like an idea made visible. The lines have width, weight, substance.

White, or perhaps softly iridescent — catching hints of rainbow at certain angles like a soap bubble or a dove's wing. The white isn't stark or sterile; it's the white of clouds, of hope, of possibility.

The circle is perfect, unbroken, continuous. The lines within are clean and certain. There's no hesitation in this symbol — it knows what it means.

## The Glow

Around the symbol, a soft luminescence spreads outward. This isn't dramatic backlighting but a gentle emanation, as if peace itself generates light. The glow fades from bright near the symbol through softer halos into the surrounding sky.

The effect is like looking at something sacred — not religious necessarily, but meaningful. Set apart. Special.

## The Sky

Behind the symbol, the sky is that particular soft blue of early morning or late afternoon — not the harsh blue of noon but the gentle blue of peaceful times. Perhaps clouds drift in the distance, soft and unthreatening, white pillows on blue sheets.

The sky might carry hints of other colors at its edges — soft pink, gentle gold — as if dawn or dusk wraps the scene in transition, in change, in hope.

## The Feeling

Looking at this symbol should feel like exhaling. Like putting down a weight you didn't know you were carrying. Like the moment after an argument when everyone decides to just... stop.

This is peace as aspiration, as prayer, as possibility. Not peace as achieved — we're not there yet — but peace as believed in. Peace as worked toward. Peace as the thing we keep saying we want.

"All we are saying..."

You know the rest.

## Historical Weight

This symbol emerged in 1958, designed for the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. The lines are semaphore signals for N and D — Nuclear Disarmament — enclosed in a circle representing the world.

But it has transcended its origins. Now it means something bigger than any campaign: the human hope for a world without war. Without violence. Without fear.

Every generation discovers it anew. Every teenager who draws it on their notebook is part of a chain stretching back sixty-plus years and forward into hope.

## Style Direction

Ethereal but substantial. The symbol should feel real, present, meaningful — not a bumper sticker but a belief made visible. Soft colors, gentle light, peaceful atmosphere. Board game illustration quality with visible brushwork. The kind of image that makes you pause and remember what matters. No text — the symbol speaks for itself.
