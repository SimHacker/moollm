## The Image

A generous stack of homemade chocolate chip cookies rises from a cooling rack on a cozy kitchen counter, each cookie slightly imperfect in that wonderful way that says "made with love, not machines."

The cookies are still warm — the faintest wisps of steam curl upward, and the chocolate chips are that perfect state of melty where they'd leave smudges on your fingers. The tops are golden-brown with darker edges, while the centers remain soft and pale, promising that ideal chewy texture. A few crumbs have tumbled onto the granite counter, along with a light dusting of flour from the baking session.

Afternoon light streams through a kitchen window, casting warm highlights across the chocolate chips and creating soft shadows between the stacked cookies. Everything glows with that amber kitchen-light quality that makes you feel like you've come home.

## The Feel

This image should evoke:
- **Childhood** — running home from school to find cookies waiting
- **Reward** — you earned these, you deserve them
- **Warmth** — literal and emotional, the kitchen as heart of home
- **Anticipation** — the first bite hasn't happened yet

The cookies aren't perfect circles. They spread a little, they have cracks, some chips sank and some poked up. That's the beauty. These are real cookies, not factory output.

## The Style

- Modern board game illustration with clean bold lines
- Rich, saturated colors but not cartoonish
- Slight painterly texture, not photorealistic
- Warm color palette: golds, browns, cream, chocolate
- Centered composition with the cookie stack as hero
- Professional illustration quality

## ⚠️ CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS — PURE ARTWORK ONLY

**This is JUST the illustration — like art that goes inside a card frame.**

FORBIDDEN:
- NO text, labels, words, letters, or numbers ANYWHERE in the image
- NO card borders, frames, UI elements, or game chrome
- NO badges, icons, overlays, or info boxes
- NO mini-cards, card references, or "card within image"
- NO watermarks, logos, signatures, or branding

The output should look like a painting you could hang on a wall.
Pure scene. Pure illustration. Nothing else.
