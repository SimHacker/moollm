# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# LAYER 1: COMPOSITION ANALYSIS
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

layer_1_composition:
  name: "Composition Analysis"
  relevance: "Classic crescent framed by clouds and stars"
  
  observations:
    focal_point: "Crescent moon, slightly left of center"
    orientation: "Moon faces right (traditional 'waxing' orientation)"
    negative_space: "Deep sky creates vast emptiness — moon stands alone"
    framing:
      - "Clouds at bottom create soft horizon/ground"
      - "Stars scattered as celestial accompaniment"
      - "Glow halo frames the crescent"
      
  balance:
    - "Moon offset left, balanced by star clusters right"
    - "Clouds heavier on left, lighter on right — subtle asymmetry"
    - "Overall feeling: peaceful, not static"
    
  vertical_zones:
    top_third: "Deep sky with scattered stars"
    middle_third: "Moon with glow halo — hero zone"
    bottom_third: "Cloud layer — soft ground"
    
  crescent_details:
    curve: "Classic C-shape, elegant arc"
    points: "Sharp tips, well-defined"
    crater_suggestion: "Subtle circular shadows imply lunar surface"
    
  prompt_adherence: "90% — beautiful crescent, gentle mood, no face (good)"
  
  notes: |
    The composition is deliberately simple — Moon IS simplicity,
    peace, nighttime calm. Complex composition would fight the mood.
    The clouds add just enough interest without competing.

# LAYER 2: LIGHTING ANALYSIS
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

layer_2_lighting:
  name: "Lighting Analysis"
  relevance: "Moon as sole light source creates dreamy atmosphere"
  
  observations:
    moon_as_light_source:
      - "Moon doesn't receive light — it EMITS light"
      - "Soft glow halo spreads outward from crescent"
      - "Halo fades from white-blue to deep blue sky"
      
    glow_characteristics:
      inner_glow: "Bright white, almost overexposed at crescent edge"
      outer_glow: "Soft blue-white fade into sky"
      range: "Extends ~30% beyond moon's edge"
      
    cloud_illumination:
      - "Clouds catch moonlight from above"
      - "Top surfaces brighter than undersides"
      - "Soft rim lighting on cloud edges"
      - "Creates sense of atmosphere between viewer and moon"
      
    star_behavior:
      - "Stars are secondary light points"
      - "Dimmer near moon (realistic)"
      - "Brighter in far corners (correct physics)"
      
  color_temperature:
    moon: "Cool white with slight blue cast"
    sky: "Deep blue-purple gradient"
    clouds: "Warm cream/silver where lit"
    
  notes: |
    The lighting is physically impossible (crescent moon shouldn't
    emit light like this) but EMOTIONALLY correct. This is the moon
    of stories, not astronomy. The glow is the feeling of moonlight.

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# LAYER 3: EMOTIONAL TELLS
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

layer_3_emotional:
  name: "Emotional Tells"
  relevance: "Every element contributes to peaceful nighttime mood"
  
  observations:
    overall_mood: "Peaceful, dreamy, bedtime story quality"
    
    emotional_elements:
      crescent_shape:
        feel: "Gentle, not full — suggests transition, not completeness"
        association: "Waxing moon = things beginning, hope, future"
        
      color_palette:
        blues: "Deep night blue = calm, restful, contemplative"
        whites: "Moon silver = purity, clarity, guidance"
        cream_clouds: "Soft warmth = comfort, not cold"
        
      negative_space:
        feel: "Vast but not threatening — peaceful emptiness"
        association: "The quiet of 3am, the world asleep"
        
      cloud_placement:
        feel: "Soft ground, dreamer's perspective"
        association: "Floating, drifting, between wake and sleep"
        
      star_scatter:
        feel: "Companions, not distractions"
        association: "Not alone in the night"
        
    storybook_quality:
      - "Goodnight Moon vibes achieved"
      - "Gentle enough for children's book"
      - "Magical enough for dreamers"
      
    what_it_evokes:
      - "Looking out bedroom window as a child"
      - "Wish upon a star"
      - "The moon follows you home"
      - "Someone watching over sleepers"
      
  absence_of:
    - "No fear — this is friendly darkness"
    - "No drama — this is calm"
    - "No face — the moon is a presence, not a character"
    
  notes: |
    This image succeeds by what it DOESN'T do. No face on the moon
    (would be too specific), no stars arranged in patterns (would
    distract), no hard edges (would feel cold). Everything soft,
    everything gentle. This is the moon of comfort, not astronomy.

    Pairs with: Rocket (Rocket to the Moon), Sun (Night and Day),
    Dreams (Dreamscape). The Moon is a destination, a contrast, a dream.
