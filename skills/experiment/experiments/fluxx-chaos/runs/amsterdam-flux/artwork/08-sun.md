# The Sun — Visual Prose Prompt (YANG)

## The Source

Look up. There it is — the reason everything exists.

The Sun. Not a distant star, not a scientific abstraction, but THE Sun. Our sun. The golden disc that has greeted every morning since mornings began.

## The Disc Itself

The sun fills the center of the frame, a perfect circle of brilliant gold. Not harsh white like a photograph — this is the sun of paintings, of children's drawings, of dreams. Rich yellow at the core, warming to deep orange-gold at the edges where the chromosphere whispers of the fires within.

The surface isn't smooth — there's texture there, the suggestion of plasma, of magnetic storms, of the roiling energy that powers everything we know. But it's stylized, approachable. This is a friendly sun, a board-game sun, a sun that wants to warm you, not burn you.

## The Rays

Radiating outward in all directions, the sunbeams reach toward the edges of the frame and beyond. They alternate in color — bright gold and softer pale yellow, creating rhythm and movement even in stillness.

These aren't harsh laser beams but soft wedges of light, broadening as they extend, filling the sky with their warmth. Between the rays, the blue sky shows through, creating that classic sun-burst pattern that humans have drawn since the first cave paintings.

Some rays are longer, some shorter, creating gentle asymmetry within the overall radial balance. The sun breathes.

## The Corona

Around the main disc, a soft glow spreads outward — the corona of light that surrounds all brilliance. This halo fades from intense yellow-white near the sun's edge through softer gold into the blue sky beyond.

The transition is gradual, peaceful. No hard edges. Just light doing what light does — spreading, warming, reaching.

## The Sky

Behind and around the sun, the sky is that particular clear blue that only exists on perfect summer days. Near the sun, it's pale, almost white, bleached by proximity to all that light. Further out, it deepens to true sky blue, creating a natural gradient that focuses attention on the golden center.

No clouds today. Nothing to interrupt the sun's generous broadcast of light and warmth.

## The Feeling

This is the sun of lazy summer afternoons. The sun that makes you close your eyes and turn your face upward. The sun that makes flowers open and cats find patches of warmth on wooden floors.

It's not aggressive or harsh. It's giving. The sun doesn't demand anything — it just radiates, endlessly generous, the ultimate symbol of life-giving energy.

Looking at this image should feel warm. Should feel like stepping outside on the first really good day of spring. Should feel like hope and growth and everything being possible.

## Style Direction

Bright, warm, and joyful. Bold yellows and golds against clear blue. The kind of sun you'd see on a greeting card or a children's book cover — stylized but not cartoonish, warm but not naive. Painterly brushwork, visible texture, board-game collectibility. No faces on the sun, no anthropomorphizing. Just pure celestial warmth rendered in paint. No text anywhere.
