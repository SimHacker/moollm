  key_discoveries:
    - "Diagonal angle creates dynamic, offering gesture"
    - "Gold foil crinkles are hero detail — luxury signifier"
    - "All-warm palette creates indulgence without guilt"
    - "Simple prompt worked better than complex one"
    
  style_assessment:

  goal_readiness:
    squishy_chocolate: "Ready to pair with Sun for melting goal"
    
  lesson_learned: |
    Chocolate failed twice with complex prompts (generated
    people instead of chocolate). Simple, direct prompt
    succeeded. Sometimes less is more.
    
  for_future_prompts:
    - "Diagonal angles add dynamism to product shots"
    - "Metallic foil textures sell premium quality"
    - "All-warm palettes for indulgent subjects"
    - "Keep prompts simple for challenging subjects"
