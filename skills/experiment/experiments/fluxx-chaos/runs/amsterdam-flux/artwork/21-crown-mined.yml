mining_date: "2026-01-24"
image_file: "21-crown.png"
status: "FAILED"
failure_reason: "Complete card UI with title and game text"

observed_issues:
  - type: "card_title"
    description: "'Type: Treasure: # Royal Regalia' header"
  - type: "game_text"
    description: "Gibberish mechanics text at bottom"
    sample: "'This emdes by generations of mouaing might of the Kingdom'"
  - type: "stat_display"
    description: "Diplomacy rolls, gold coin references"

what_was_requested:
  - "Royal crown on velvet cushion"
  - "Still life of regalia"
  - "Pure artwork"

what_was_generated:
  - "Crown itself is beautiful — gold, rubies, sapphires"
  - "Velvet cushion and tassels — nice touch"
  - "Royal purple background — appropriate"
  - "BUT overlaid with complete card game interface"

composition_analysis:
  crown_quality: "excellent — detailed metalwork, gem facets"
  cushion: "red velvet with gold tassels"
  background: "purple drapes, regal atmosphere"
  ruined_by: "card UI with nonsense game mechanics"

lesson_learned: |
  Same issue as music card — "board game" triggers card UI.
  Describe as "painting" or "still life" only.
