# LAYER 1: RADIAL COMPOSITION

layer_1_composition:
  name: "Radial Composition"
  relevance: "Perfect radial symmetry creates iconic presence"
  
  observations:
    center_disc:
      position: "Dead center"
      shape: "Perfect circle"
      gradient: "White-hot core fading to golden orange edge"
      
    ray_pattern:
      count: "~20 rays radiating outward"
      alternation: "Gold and pale yellow, creating rhythm"
      length: "Extend to all edges of frame"
      style: "Soft-edged, slightly fuzzy, painterly"
      
    balance:
      symmetry: "Nearly perfect radial symmetry"
      stability: "Centered, grounded, confident"
      energy: "Radiating outward equally in all directions"
      
  background:
    sky_color: "Clear blue, gradient lighter near sun"
    contrast: "Blue/gold complementary colors"
    
  prompt_adherence: "100% — exactly the friendly, iconic sun requested"

# LAYER 2: COLOR TEMPERATURE

layer_2_color:
  name: "Color Temperature Analysis"
  relevance: "Warm vs cool creates the feeling of heat"
  
  observations:
    warm_zone:
      colors: ["white", "pale yellow", "gold", "orange"]
      location: "Center radiating outward"
      temperature: "Maximum warmth — this IS warmth"
      
    cool_zone:
      colors: ["sky blue", "deeper blue at edges"]
      location: "Surrounding the sun, between rays"
      temperature: "Cool contrast emphasizes warmth"
      
    interaction:
      - "Warm rays penetrate cool sky"
      - "Blue visible between gold rays creates vibration"
      - "Complementary colors (orange/blue) maximum contrast"
      
    gradient_quality:
      core: "White-hot, almost overexposed"
      mid: "Rich golden yellow"
      edge: "Orange tending toward the rays"
      
  emotional_temperature: "This image feels warm to look at"

# LAYER 3: STYLE CONSISTENCY

layer_3_style:
  name: "Style Consistency Check"
  relevance: "Does it match the Moon card for celestial pair?"
  
  observations:
    vs_moon:
      shared: "Centered celestial body, simple composition"
      contrast: "Warm vs cool palette (intentional)"
      pairing: "Would make excellent diptych"
      
    painterly_quality:
      brushwork: "Visible in ray edges, soft texture"
      not_photographic: "Clearly illustrated, stylized"
      board_game_feel: "Collectible, iconic, friendly"
      
    looney_labs_adherence:
      whimsy: 0.90  # Friendly sun, not harsh
      bold_colors: 0.95  # Clear, saturated
      family_friendly: 1.0  # Universally appealing
      
  goal_readiness:
    squishy_chocolate: "Pairs with chocolate for melting goal"
    celestial_pair: "Pairs with moon for day/night contrast"
