## The Image

A luminous crescent moon hangs in a deep velvet night sky, its silver-white glow spreading outward like a gentle benediction over the sleeping world below. This is the Moon of bedtime stories and lullabies, the friendly guardian of dreamers.

The crescent shape curves gracefully against the darkness, its surface showing subtle craters and maria rendered in soft silvery grays — stylized, not clinical. A gentle halo of light emanates from the moon, fading into the deep blue-black of space.

Stars scatter across the sky around the Moon — not competing with it, but accompanying it like a court of tiny admirers. Some twinkle more brightly than others. Perhaps one is a planet. Perhaps one is a wish waiting to be caught.

Wispy clouds drift below the Moon, catching its silver light and glowing faintly at their edges. The overall feeling is of deep night — not the scary darkness of monsters, but the peaceful darkness of rest, of dreams, of the world taking a breath before dawn.

## The Feel

This image should evoke:
- **Peace** — the quiet of 3 AM when even the wind sleeps
- **Dreams** — the Moon watches over those who dream
- **Magic** — nighttime is when the ordinary becomes extraordinary
- **Comfort** — the Moon has been there every night of your life

Think "Goodnight Moon" — that same gentle, sleepy, everything-is-okay feeling. The Moon is a friend, a guardian, a constant companion.
