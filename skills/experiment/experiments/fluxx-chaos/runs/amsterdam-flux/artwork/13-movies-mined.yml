what_was_requested:
  - "Film clapperboard mid-clap"
  - "Cinematic atmosphere"

what_was_generated:
  - "Beautiful clapperboard with motion blur"
  - "Excellent warm bokeh lighting"
  - "But clapperboards inherently have text fields"

composition_analysis:
  focal_point: "clapperboard at diagonal angle"
  lighting: "warm golden bokeh, film set atmosphere"
  depth: "shallow focus creates cinematic feel"
  quality: "high — photorealistic style"

lesson_learned: |
  Clapperboards are text-heavy objects by design.
  For "movies" concept, use film reel instead —
  a more iconic symbol with no inherent text.
