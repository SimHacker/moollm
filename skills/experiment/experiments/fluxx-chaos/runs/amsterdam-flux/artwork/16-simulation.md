## The Image

A wireframe globe hovers in digital space, Earth rendered in glowing lines of code. Data streams flow across its surface like weather patterns made of information — green cascades of matrix rain, blue network connections pulsing with traffic.

The sphere illuminates itself, casting no shadows, existing in perfect computational clarity. Around it, particles of data drift in the void — bits awaiting assembly into meaning.

This is the simulation question made visual: if reality is computation, what does the computer look like from inside?

## The Feel

Philosophical vertigo. The beautiful terror of the simulation hypothesis. Technology so advanced it becomes metaphysics.

## The Style

Digital illustration in board game card art style with moollm-tech overlay — deep space blues, matrix greens, that retrofuturistic glow. The globe as concept, centered and luminous.

*Pure visual art, silent scene, digital world as portrait.*
