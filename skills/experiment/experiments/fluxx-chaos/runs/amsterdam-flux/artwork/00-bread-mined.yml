# LAYER 1: COMPOSITION ANALYSIS

layer_1_composition:
  name: "Composition Analysis"
  relevance: "Classic still life with dramatic framing"
  
  observations:
    focal_point: "Sourdough loaf, centered on cutting board"
    hero_element: "Star-pattern score marks draw eye to center"
    supporting_elements:
      - "Window blazing with golden light (upper left)"
      - "Bread knife (right side, ready position)"
      - "Flour scattered across board surface"
      - "Steam rising in dramatic wisps"
      
  depth_layers:
    foreground: "Flour clumps, board edge details"
    midground: "Bread loaf, knife, main cutting board"
    background: "Window, wall, atmospheric dust motes"
    
  contrast_zones:
    bright: "Window, bread crust highlights, steam"
    dark: "Background wall, board shadows"
    
  balance:
    - "Bread centered but window pulls eye left"
    - "Knife provides horizontal counterweight right"
    - "Asymmetric but stable"
    
  scoring_pattern:
    shape: "Star or cross pattern — 4 slashes"
    effect: "Creates natural focal point"
    craftsmanship: "Shows baker's hand, not machine"
    
  prompt_adherence: "100% — pure bread still life, no characters, warm kitchen"
  
  notes: |
    This composition works as a Dutch Golden Age still life.
    The dramatic window light, the humble subject elevated,
    the careful arrangement — this is bread as ART.

# LAYER 2: LIGHTING ANALYSIS

layer_2_lighting:
  name: "Lighting Analysis"
  relevance: "Chiaroscuro window light creates drama"
  
  observations:
    primary_source:
      location: "Window, upper left"
      intensity: "Blazing — almost overexposed"
      color: "Deep gold, amber, honey"
      quality: "Strong directional light, theatrical"
      
    lighting_effects:
      on_bread:
        - "Bright highlights on crust ridges"
        - "Score marks catch light dramatically"
        - "Shadow side has rich amber reflected light"
        - "Flour dusting catches rim light"
        
      on_environment:
        - "Cutting board has strong highlight/shadow gradients"
        - "Knife blade reflects window"
        - "Flour clumps cast tiny shadows"
        - "Steam glows as it rises through light beam"
        
      atmospheric:
        - "Dust motes visible in light shaft"
        - "Background falls to dramatic darkness"
        - "Chiaroscuro effect (strong light/dark contrast)"
        
    color_temperature:
      highlights: "Warm amber/gold (~2800K)"
      midtones: "Warm brown"
      shadows: "Cool blue-grey"
      
    mood_created: "Dramatic, reverent — bread as sacred object"
    
  art_historical_reference: |
    This lighting evokes Vermeer's window scenes or
    Zurbarán's still life paintings. The ordinary
    elevated through light. The bread becomes holy.
    
  notes: |
    The window being SO bright is the key choice. A gentler light
    would make a nice image. This DRAMATIC light makes art.
    The contrast between blazing window and dark background
    focuses attention absolutely on the bread.

# LAYER 3: TEXTURE & DETAIL

layer_3_texture:
  name: "Texture & Detail"
  relevance: "Crust detail and flour scatter sell authenticity"
  
  observations:
    bread_surface:
      crust_pattern: "Concentric rings from proofing basket (banneton)"
      color_gradient: "Deep amber on ridges, lighter in valleys"
      score_marks: "Star pattern opened during baking — golden petals"
      flour_dusting: "White powder in crust grooves"
      
    crust_qualities:
      - "Crackled texture implies perfect crust snap"
      - "Caramelization visible in color variation"
      - "Not too uniform — handmade quality"
      
    cutting_board:
      material: "Weathered oak with visible grain"
      wear: "Knife marks, stains from years of use"
      flour: "Scattered in organic clumps, not too neat"
      
    knife_detail:
      blade: "Serrated bread knife, metallic sheen"
      handle: "Wooden with rivets — classic design"
      position: "Ready but resting — invitation"
      
    steam:
      behavior: "Rises in curling wisps"
      light_interaction: "Glows where crossing light beam"
      implication: "JUST out of oven — fresh, warm"
      
  painterly_quality:
    style: "Bold outlines with textured fills"
    detail_level: "High on bread, medium on environment"
    technique: "Board game illustration meets fine art"
    
  notes: |
    The banneton ring pattern is chef's kiss detail. Only
    someone who knows bread would include this. It implies
    artisan process — shaped by hand, proofed in basket,
    scored with intention. This is CRAFT bread.
