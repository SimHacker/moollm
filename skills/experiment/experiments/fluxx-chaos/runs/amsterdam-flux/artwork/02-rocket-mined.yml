# LAYER 1: COMPOSITION ANALYSIS
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

layer_1_composition:
  name: "Composition Analysis"
  relevance: "Powerful vertical thrust with cosmic framing"
  
  observations:
    focal_point: "Rocket dead center, nose pointing up"
    movement: "Strong upward thrust — everything says ASCENT"
    framing_elements:
      - "Moon upper left (destination!)"
      - "Earth curve bottom (origin)"
      - "Galaxies scattered as cosmic context"
      - "Orange spiral trail creates dynamic motion"
      
  balance:
    - "Rocket centered, Moon and galaxies create asymmetric interest"
    - "Earth curve at bottom grounds the scene"
    - "Spiral exhaust trail adds circular motion to vertical thrust"
    
  depth_planes:
    foreground: "Exhaust cloud and flames"
    midground: "Rocket ship"
    background: "Moon, stars, galaxies, Earth curve"
    
  rule_of_thirds:
    rocket: "Centered vertically, fills middle third"
    moon: "Upper left intersection"
    earth: "Lower third"
    
  prompt_adherence: "100% — captured retro rocket, Moon destination, space setting"
  
  notes: |
    The orange spiral trail is the surprise element — wasn't requested
    but adds tremendous dynamic energy. The rocket isn't just going up,
    it's SPIRALING up with verve and vigor. Flash Gordon would approve.

# LAYER 2: LIGHTING ANALYSIS
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

layer_2_lighting:
  name: "Lighting Analysis"
  relevance: "Engine glow and starlight create dramatic contrast"
  
  observations:
    primary_sources:
      - "Rocket exhaust — bright orange-yellow at thrust point"
      - "Starfield ambient light"
      - "Moon reflection"
      
    engine_glow:
      color: "Brilliant orange-yellow fading to white at core"
      intensity: "Brightest point in image"
      effects: 
        - "Illuminates exhaust cloud from within"
        - "Creates rim light on red fins"
        - "Spiral trail glows with residual heat"
        
    chrome_reflections:
      - "Rocket body catches light from multiple sources"
      - "Nose cone has star-point highlight"
      - "Portholes glow with interior light"
      
    space_lighting:
      - "Moon has realistic surface lighting"
      - "Galaxies glow with distant light"
      - "Stars twinkle at various intensities"
      
  color_contrast:
    warm: "Engine thrust, spiral trail, Earth atmosphere"
    cool: "Deep space, Moon surface, distant galaxies"
    
  notes: |
    The lighting tells a story: warm = where we're going (adventure),
    cool = the vast space we're crossing. The rocket bridges both.
    The spiral trail maintains warmth even in cold space.

# LAYER 3: UNEXPECTED ELEMENTS
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

layer_3_unexpected:
  name: "Unexpected Elements"
  relevance: "Happy accidents that improve on the prompt"
  
  observations:
    spiral_exhaust_trail:
      description: "Orange spiral wrapping around the rocket's path"
      impact: "Adds tremendous dynamic energy — spiral implies SPINNING"
      interpretation: "Rocket is corkscrewing up through atmosphere"
      notes: "Not requested but dramatically improves the image"
      
    multiple_galaxies:
      description: "At least 4 distinct spiral galaxies visible"
      impact: "Creates sense of cosmic scale"
      interpretation: "This isn't just going to the Moon — it's going to the COSMOS"
      
    exhaust_cloud_detail:
      description: "Billowing cloud with internal structure"
      impact: "Grounds the launch moment — feels like liftoff"
      notes: "More detailed than expected, adds realism"
      
    porthole_glow:
      description: "Windows on rocket emit warm interior light"
      impact: "Implies someone is INSIDE — adds life"
      interpretation: "This isn't an empty rocket — someone's going to the Moon"
      
    earth_atmosphere_band:
      description: "Thin blue-white band at Earth's edge"
      impact: "Scientific accuracy adds authenticity"
      
  happy_accidents:
    - "The spiral adds so much energy — keep this in future prompts"
    - "Multiple galaxies expand scope beyond 'just the Moon'"
    - "Glowing portholes add narrative — someone's aboard!"
    
  notes: |
    This image exceeded expectations. The generator understood
    "retro-futurism" and "Flash Gordon vibes" and added appropriate
    flourishes. The spiral trail especially — this is the kind of
    emergent detail that makes AI art collaboration rewarding.
