# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# LAYER 1: COMPOSITION ANALYSIS
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

layer_1_composition:
  name: "Composition Analysis"
  relevance: "Iconic symbol demands iconic presentation"
  
  observations:
    central_heart:
      position: "Dead center, slightly lower third"
      size: "Dominant — fills ~40% of frame"
      presence: "Unmistakable, instantly readable"
      
    floating_elements:
      small_hearts: "~20 smaller hearts orbit the main heart"
      variety: "Different sizes, styles, colors"
      distribution: "Scattered around, denser near center"
      sparkles: "White star-bursts punctuate the composition"
      
    balance:
      symmetry: "Heart itself is symmetric"
      surrounding: "Floating elements create gentle asymmetry"
      visual_weight: "Heavy center, light periphery"
      
    background:
      gradient: "Warm peach/pink fading to darker mauve edges"
      glow: "Bright spot behind heart — it radiates"
      vignette: "Subtle darkening at corners focuses attention"
      
  prompt_adherence: "100% — exactly what was requested"
  
  notes: |
    This is deliberately simple composition because the symbol
    is universally recognized. The floating hearts add interest
    without competing. The centered placement is correct for
    an iconic, universal symbol.

# LAYER 2: TEXTURE & CONSTRUCTION
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

layer_2_texture:
  name: "Texture & Construction"
  relevance: "Heart made of hearts — a lovely emergent detail"
  
  observations:
    heart_construction:
      material: "Made of smaller heart-shaped petals"
      technique: "Rose-petal arrangement — each petal heart-shaped"
      effect: "Love made of loves — recursive symbolism"
      texture: "Soft, organic, touchable"
      
    individual_petals:
      shape: "Small rounded hearts"
      color_variation: "Reds and corals, varying saturation"
      arrangement: "Clustered organically, not geometric"
      edges: "Soft, overlapping, dimensional"
      
    floating_hearts:
      styles: "Mix of outline and filled"
      colors: "Red, pink, coral, magenta spectrum"
      line_quality: "Some painterly, some more graphic"
      sparkle_accents: "White star-bursts add magic"
      
    dimensionality:
      main_heart: "Clearly 3D — shadows, highlights"
      petals: "Layer on each other with depth"
      glow: "Light from behind adds rim highlighting"
      
  unexpected_detail: |
    The heart being made of smaller hearts was emergent — not
    explicitly requested but perfectly appropriate. Love is
    made of many loves. The recursive symbolism is beautiful.
  
  notes: |
    This texture choice transforms the image from "icon" to "art."
    A flat heart would be clip-art. A heart made of rose-petal-
    hearts is illustration. The generator understood the brief
    better than the brief did.

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# LAYER 3: EMOTIONAL TELLS
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

layer_3_emotional:
  name: "Emotional Tells"
  relevance: "Does it feel like love? Does it feel warm?"
  
  observations:
    warmth:
      color_temperature: "Entirely warm — no cool tones"
      light_quality: "Soft, diffused, embracing"
      palette: "Reds, pinks, peaches, corals — all warm"
      feeling: "Like being held, like a hug visualized"
      
    softness:
      no_hard_edges: "Everything soft, rounded, gentle"
      glow_effects: "Soft bloom around everything"
      line_quality: "Rounded hearts, no sharp points"
      implication: "Love is gentle, not aggressive"
      
    abundance:
      many_hearts: "Love multiplies, creates more love"
      scattered_freely: "Love isn't scarce — it's everywhere"
      variety: "Many kinds of love, all colors"
      sparkles: "Magic, the ineffable quality"
      
    emotional_reading:
      primary: "Tender"
      secondary: "Joyful"
      tertiary: "Abundant"
      overall: "All you need"
      
  storybook_quality:
    - "Could be in a Valentine's Day children's book"
    - "Warm enough for romance, gentle enough for family"
    - "Universal — no specific relationship implied"
    
  notes: |
    Looking at this image genuinely feels warm. That's the test.
    If you see it and feel something soft in your chest, it worked.
    The warmth isn't just visual — it's emotional.
