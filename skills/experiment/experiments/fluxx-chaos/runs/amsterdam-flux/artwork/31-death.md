## The Image

A hooded figure emerges from swirling darkness, empty eye sockets of a skull visible within the cowl's shadow. Skeletal hands grip a scythe whose blade catches cold light — the harvesting tool for souls.

The robes seem to be made of shadow itself, edges fraying into mist. This is Death not as monster but as function — patient, inevitable, here for everyone eventually.

Cold blue light emanates from somewhere within, the only illumination in an image otherwise swallowed by darkness.

## The Feel

Inevitability. The patient certainty that comes for all. Not evil exactly, but absolutely unwelcome. The Creeper you dread drawing.

## The Style

Digital illustration in board game card art style with creeper overlay — the darkest palette, cold and final. Death as portrait of the end.

*Pure visual art, silent scene, the reaper as portrait.*
