## The Image

A crystal ball rests on its ornate brass stand, surface impossibly clear yet filled with swirling mists that seem to move as you watch. Light emanates from within — not reflected but generated, a soft glow that suggests the ball contains a small piece of tomorrow.

The stand is worked brass, eagle talons or dragon claws gripping the sphere with appropriate reverence. The craftsmanship suggests this object passed through many hands, each one seeking answers.

The mists inside shift between purple and blue, occasionally hinting at shapes that might be futures or might be nothing at all.

## The Feel

Mystery. The human hunger to know what comes next. The dangerous allure of prophecy — do you really want to know?

## The Style

Digital illustration in board game card art style. Deep mystical purples, inner luminescence, that fortune teller aesthetic made elegant. The crystal ball as window to possibility.

*Pure visual art, silent scene, mystical object as portrait.*
