## The Image

A perfectly wrapped gift sits in warm light, red paper smooth and unmarred, golden ribbon tied in an elaborate bow that curls with deliberate elegance. The package is that perfect cube shape that could contain anything — possibility made material.

The wrapping job speaks of care, of someone taking time to make the outside match the thought inside. Light catches the ribbon's surface, creating highlights that trace the loops of the bow.

This is potential joy, compressed into paper and ribbon, waiting for the right moment to release.

## The Feel

Anticipation. The joy of giving and receiving. That moment before opening when anything is possible and the gift could be perfect.

## The Style

Digital illustration in board game card art style. Rich holiday reds, celebratory golds, warm inviting light. The gift as promise, centered and waiting.

*Pure visual art, silent scene, wrapped possibility as portrait.*
