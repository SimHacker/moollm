# Love — Visual Prose Prompt (YANG)

## The Heart

There it is. The most universal symbol humanity has ever created.

A heart. Not the anatomical pump, but the iconic shape — those two curved lobes meeting at the top, sweeping down to that decisive point at the bottom. The shape that means one thing in every language, every culture, every age.

This heart is red. Not just any red — THE red. Valentine red. Rose-petal red. The red you see behind your eyelids when you close them in sunlight. The red of warmth and blood and life itself.

## Texture and Dimension

The heart isn't flat — it has dimension, depth, a softness that makes you want to reach out and touch it. The surface looks like velvet, like rose petals, like something that would yield gently under your fingertips and spring back warm.

Light catches the curves, creating subtle highlights on the lobes, deeper shadows in the center cleft. This is a heart with presence, with weight, with substance. Not a symbol — a thing. A real thing that holds real love.

## The Glow

The heart radiates. It doesn't just sit there reflecting light — it generates its own. A soft warm glow emanates from within, pulsing ever so slightly, like breath, like a heartbeat, like something alive.

This inner light creates a halo around the heart, a rosy aura that spreads into the surrounding air. The heart doesn't just contain love — it broadcasts it, shares it, sends it out into the world without asking anything in return.

## The Atmosphere Around It

The background is pure warmth — a gradient that flows from soft pink at the edges through peachy coral to warm gold behind the heart. No hard edges, no distractions. Just color that cradles the heart like loving arms.

Floating in this warm air: smaller hearts, drifting like bubbles or dandelion seeds. Some are tiny pinpricks of red, others are soft pink whispers. They orbit the main heart like planets around a sun, or children around a parent.

Sparkles catch the light — gold flecks, white motes, little points of brilliance that suggest magic, pixie dust, the ineffable quality of love itself. They're not overwhelming — just enough to say: this is special. This matters.

## The Feeling

Looking at this image should feel like being hugged. Like coming home. Like hearing "I love you" in the voice of someone who means it.

It's not romantic love specifically — this is bigger than that. This is the love that holds families together. The love between friends who would do anything for each other. The love for a pet who greets you at the door. The love for a stranger who needs help.

All you need.

## Style Direction

Warm, soft, and inviting. The kind of image you'd find on a greeting card, but elevated — painterly, with visible brushwork that keeps it from being too slick. Bold red that commands attention, soft pinks that soothe, gold accents that speak of value. No text, no words — the heart says everything. Pure visual tenderness.
