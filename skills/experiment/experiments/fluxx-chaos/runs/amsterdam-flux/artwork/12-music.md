# Music — Simple Visual Prompt

A beautiful sunburst electric guitar (Les Paul style) displayed under dramatic spotlight.

The guitar has a classic sunburst finish — honey amber at center fading to cherry red at edges. Gleaming chrome hardware. Strings catch the light.

Warm stage lighting from above. Simple gradient background.

Style: Illustrated, painterly, like a still life painting of a musical instrument.

**This is pure artwork. A painting of just the guitar.**
