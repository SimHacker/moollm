## The Image

An electric guitar hangs in golden spotlight, strings catching light like threads of pure sound waiting to be released. The sunburst finish radiates outward from the body's center — honey amber at the core bleeding into deep cherry at the edges, finally fading to black at the curves.

The frets gleam like possibilities. The pickups sit ready. Every scratch and worn spot on the finish tells stories of late nights, cramped vans, and that perfect moment when the crowd finally gets it.

This is the Keeper you want when goals involve entertainment, parties, or anything worth celebrating. It's not just wood and wire — it's condensed human emotion with an output jack.

## The Feel

Electric. Anticipatory. The moment before the first chord.

Rock and roll attitude tempered with soulful depth. The guitar doesn't care about your genre — it serves blues and metal, folk and funk, whatever story you need to tell.

## The Style

Digital illustration in modern board game card art style. Rich saturated colors with painterly texture. Dramatic spotlight creating strong value contrast. The guitar as hero subject, centered, powerful.

*Pure visual art, silent scene, the instrument as portrait.*
