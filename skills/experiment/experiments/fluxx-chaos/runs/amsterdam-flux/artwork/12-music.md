# Music — Simple Visual Prompt (v3)

Musical notes dancing joyfully through the air.

Treble clefs spiral gracefully. Quarter notes and eighth notes float and swirl in flowing patterns. Musical staffs curve like ribbons. The notes seem alive, expressing pure joy of sound.

Warm golden light illuminates the dancing notation. Deep purple and magenta accents add depth. The composition feels like visible sound — music you can see.

Centered composition with notes radiating outward from the middle. Abstract and universal — this is MUSIC itself, not any specific instrument.

Style: Whimsical illustrated art, magical and expressive.

**This is pure artwork. A painting of music made visible.**
