## The Image

A magnificent unicorn stands in a forest clearing, coat gleaming purest white, silver mane flowing like liquid starlight. The spiral horn rises from its forehead — a twist of crystalline magic that catches and refracts light into subtle rainbow patterns.

The creature's eyes hold ancient wisdom and gentle power. Its stance is proud but not aggressive — the quiet confidence of a being that knows exactly how rare and precious it is.

Soft magical light filters through trees suggested in the background, but the unicorn commands all attention. This is the creature that grants wishes, that appears only to the pure of heart.

## The Feel

Pure magic. The rare and precious. That feeling of glimpsing something that might not exist, and having it look back at you.

## The Style

Digital illustration in board game card art style. Ethereal whites and silvers, soft rainbow accents on the horn, magical forest atmosphere. The unicorn as mythical portrait.

*Pure visual art, silent scene, fantasy creature as portrait.*
