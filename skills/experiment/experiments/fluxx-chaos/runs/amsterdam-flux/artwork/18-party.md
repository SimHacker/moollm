## The Image

A joyful explosion of party supplies — balloons in every color bob and cluster, streamers curl through the air in frozen celebration, a pointed party hat sits jauntily amid cascading confetti.

The colors are maximum saturation, the kind of visual volume that says "we are CELEBRATING." Ribbons spiral. Glitter catches light. Everything is in motion even while standing still.

This is the essence of party distilled into objects: the promise that for these few hours, joy is mandatory and silliness is welcome.

## The Feel

Unbridled celebration. The permission to be purely happy. The colorful chaos of good times.

## The Style

Digital illustration in board game card art style. Bright saturated primaries, that slightly over-the-top party supply aesthetic. Dynamic arrangement suggesting motion and energy.

*Pure visual art, silent scene, celebration supplies as portrait.*
