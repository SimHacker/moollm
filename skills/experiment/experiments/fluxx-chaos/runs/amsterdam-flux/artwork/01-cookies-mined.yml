# LAYER 1: COMPOSITION ANALYSIS

layer_1_composition:
  name: "Composition Analysis"
  relevance: "Strong vertical stack creates tower-like focal point"
  
  observations:
    focal_point: "Cookie stack dead center, drawing eye upward"
    vertical_flow: "4-cookie stack creates ascending rhythm"
    foreground_interest: "Scattered crumbs and cooling rack add depth"
    background_layers: "Kitchen utensils, window light, baking sheet create context"
    
  balance:
    - "Stack slightly off-center left, balanced by window light right"
    - "Crumbs scattered asymmetrically create organic feel"
    - "Cooling rack provides stable base, grounds the tower"
    
  depth_planes:
    foreground: "Crumbs, flour dust, cooling rack edge"
    midground: "Cookie stack (hero)"
    background: "Kitchen utensils, window, baking sheet with more cookies"
    
  prompt_adherence: "95% — captured stack, warmth, kitchen setting perfectly"
  
  notes: |
    The broken/bitten top cookie is a happy accident — shows texture,
    reveals interior, adds narrative (someone already tasted!). Creates
    more visual interest than a perfect stack would.

# LAYER 2: TEXTURE & DETAIL

layer_2_texture:
  name: "Texture & Detail"
  relevance: "Painterly cookie textures sell the homemade quality"
  
  observations:
    cookie_surface:
      - "Golden-brown edges with darker caramelization"
      - "Soft pale centers visible through cracks"
      - "Chocolate chips glossy and melty — dripping from top cookie"
      - "Slight cracking on top surface (perfect doneness indicator)"
      
    chocolate_detail:
      - "Chips vary in size — authentic home baking"
      - "Some chips buried, some protruding"
      - "Melted chocolate drip from top cookie — money shot"
      - "Glossy vs matte surfaces on different chips"
      
    environmental_texture:
      - "Granite counter with natural grain"
      - "Cooling rack metal grid clearly rendered"
      - "Flour dust particles visible"
      - "Crumb fragments with irregular shapes"
      
  painterly_quality:
    style: "Bold outlines with textured fills"
    technique: "Clean digital illustration, board game art feel"
    detail_level: "High on cookies, softer on background"
    
  notes: |
    The melting chocolate drip from the top cookie is the hero detail.
    It implies FRESH, WARM, GOOEY — exactly what you want from cookies.
    This wasn't explicitly requested but the generator understood the brief.

# LAYER 3: LIGHTING ANALYSIS

layer_3_lighting:
  name: "Lighting Analysis"
  relevance: "Warm kitchen light creates cozy atmosphere"
  
  observations:
    primary_source:
      direction: "Upper left, through window"
      quality: "Warm afternoon golden light"
      color_temperature: "Warm (~3500K amber)"
      
    effects:
      - "Strong highlights on left side of cookie stack"
      - "Soft shadows cast to lower right"
      - "Steam/warmth visible catching light above stack"
      - "Glossy chocolate chips reflect light points"
      
    atmosphere:
      - "Window light creates depth and time-of-day"
      - "Warm overall tone — amber/gold palette"
      - "Soft ambient fill prevents harsh shadows"
      
    mood_created: "Cozy, welcoming, 'just out of the oven'"
    
  unexpected:
    - "Steam rising catches light — wasn't explicit in prompt"
    - "Reflection on granite counter adds polish"
    
  notes: |
    The lighting sells "fresh baked" more than any other element.
    Without this warm side lighting, same cookies would look store-bought.
    Light = life, warmth, home.

# MINING SUMMARY
