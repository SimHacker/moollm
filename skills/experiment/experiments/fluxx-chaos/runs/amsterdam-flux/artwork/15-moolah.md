## The Image

A thick stack of playful stylized currency fans out dramatically, bills catching neon light in pinks and cyans against their green base. This isn't government-issued tender — it's MOOLAH, the currency of the MOOLLM economy.

Each bill features subtle cow motifs (moo + moolah = oolala), rendered with that perfect balance of silly and sophisticated. The stack glows with synthwave energy, retro-futurist wealth for the AI age.

Edge lighting creates that 80s aesthetic while the green center keeps it grounded in the universal language of money.

## The Feel

Playful prosperity. The tongue-in-cheek joy of game currency that still feels valuable. Tech economy optimism with a wink.

## The Style

Digital illustration in board game card art style with moollm-tech overlay — synthwave gradients, neon accents, retro-futurism. The money stack as hero, glowing with possibility.

*Pure visual art, silent scene, stylized currency as portrait.*
