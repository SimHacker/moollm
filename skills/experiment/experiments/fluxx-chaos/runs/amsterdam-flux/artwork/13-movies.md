# Movies — Simple Visual Prompt

A classic silver film reel with celluloid strip unwinding elegantly.

The metal reel gleams under warm studio lighting. Film frames visible on the strip. Golden bokeh background suggesting movie magic.

Style: Illustrated, painterly, like a still life of cinema history.

**This is pure artwork. A painting of just a film reel.**
