  philosophy: |
    The Cosmic Dealer restrains itself.
    Generated cards appear only at PERFECT moments.
    Normal Fluxx chaos drives most action.
    
    When a card appears... it MATTERS.
    
    Cards to watch for:
    - GEN-003: Melodramatic Wail (if Donna suffers in silence)
    - GEN-005: Long Shot Echo (if Bumblewick chains victories)
    - GEN-022: Comeback Victory (if an underdog rises)
    - GEN-024: The Long Game (turn 15+, patience rewarded)
