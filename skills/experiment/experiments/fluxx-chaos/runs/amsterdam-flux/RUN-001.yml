# What's interesting:
observations:
  - "Don drew Pie Menu (card 308) first — his own invention!"
  - "Palm has half of Forbidden Fortune goal (MOOLAH on table)"
  - "Bumblewick hit by Impostor Syndrome on card 7 of deal"
  - "No goal played yet — pure positioning phase"
  - "Donna used Richard Bartle to spy on Don's hand (saw Will Wright)"
