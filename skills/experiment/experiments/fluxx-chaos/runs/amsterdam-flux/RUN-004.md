## Previously...

Palm won Canal Life on Turn 13 via Mix It All Up redistribution.

But in Don's backyard, the game never truly ends.

"Best of three?" Don suggests, ears twitching.

The cards are shuffled back. The Sharp Cheddar Cheese wheel has been replaced. The autographs remain — every card now bears the marks of battle.

**House Rule:** Play continues! First to 2 wins takes the championship.

**Score:** Palm 1, Everyone Else 0

## Round 5 — The Rematch Begins

### Turn 14 — Don Hopkins 🐰

**Draw Phase**

Don draws: **🎯 Night and Day** (Goal!)

He looks at the goal. Moon + Sun required.

He ALREADY HAS THE MOON from the Mix redistribution!

"Oh ho," Don says. "Now I just need a Sun."

*Don signs (2nd signature on this card!):*
> "The eternal cycle continues. Just like this game. — DH 🐰 (round 2)"

**Play Phase**

Don looks at his keepers: Moon, Unicorn, Marvin Minsky, Music, Crystal Ball, Milk.

He has Moon. Night and Day needs Moon + Sun. Nobody has Sun yet.

Strategic choice: Play the goal now? Or wait until he has both pieces?

**Don plays: 🎯 NIGHT AND DAY!**

**NEW GOAL: 🌙☀️ NIGHT AND DAY**
*Requires: Moon + Sun*

"I have the Moon," Don announces. "Now it's a race for the Sun."

Palm raises an eyebrow. "Bold. You don't even have the Sun yet."

"I will."

**Goal changed from Canal Life → Night and Day!**

---

### Turn 15 — Palm 🐵

**Draw Phase**

Palm draws: **🎯 Hypertext Heroes** (Goal!)

Requires: Ted Nelson + Douglas Hofstadter.

Palm looks at his keepers. He has **Ted Nelson** from the Mix!

"Interesting," Palm murmurs. "I have half of this goal as well."

*Palm signs:*
> "Links within links. The hypertext dream. — PLM (signature #2)"

**Play Phase**

Palm could replace Don's goal with his own. But he needs Douglas Hofstadter.

Decision: Hold the goal, or play it now?

**Palm plays: 🎯 HYPERTEXT HEROES!**

**NEW GOAL: 🔗🌀 HYPERTEXT HEROES**
*Requires: Ted Nelson + Douglas Hofstadter*

"I have Ted Nelson," Palm says calmly. "Now we both hunt."

Don grins. "The monkey learns! Goal warfare."

**Goal changed from Night and Day → Hypertext Heroes!**

---

### Turn 16 — Bumblewick Fantastipants 🎩

**Draw Phase**

Bumblewick draws with a trembling paw: **🖼️ Van Gogh** (Keeper)

"Oh! The painter! Starry, starry night!" Bumblewick brightens. "What a lovely card."

He looks at his two creepers. Still cursed.

*Bumblewick signs:*
> "He cut off his ear. I understand the impulse now. — B.F. 🎩 (turn 16, still cursed)"

**Play Phase**

Bumblewick's keepers: Ada Lovelace, Stroopwafel, Don Hopkins card, Circus, Castle, Cookies.

His creepers: Impostor Syndrome, Alignment Problem.

Van Gogh is a nice keeper but doesn't help with the current goal.

**Bumblewick plays: 🖼️ VAN GOGH**

The Dutch master joins Bumblewick's collection.

"I may be cursed," Bumblewick says, "but at least I have ART."

**Bumblewick's Keepers:** Ada Lovelace, Stroopwafel, Don Hopkins, Circus, Castle, Cookies, Van Gogh (7 keepers!)  
**Bumblewick's Creepers:** Still both. Still cursed.

---

### Turn 17 — Donna Toadstool 🍄

**Draw Phase**

Donna draws: **🎭 Dramatic Dealer** (New Rule!)

Her eyes light up.

"The Dealer maximizes NARRATIVE TENSION?!" She clutches the card. "That's MY WHOLE AESTHETIC!"

*Donna signs:*
> "MAXIMUM DRAMA! 34 counts of DRAMATIC FABULOUSNESS! — DT 🍄"

**Play Phase**

**Donna plays: 🎭 DRAMATIC DEALER!**

**RULES CHANGE: Dramatic Dealer active!**

*The Cosmic Dealer shifts from Dynamic to DRAMATIC mode!*

The Dealer's emoji changes: 🌊 → 🎭

"Now," Donna announces, "the universe will MAXIMIZE TENSION. Just as I deserve."

Palm sighs. "This will be exhausting."

**Dealer Mode: DRAMATIC** — The Dealer will engineer near-misses, dramatic reversals, and narrative tension.

---

### Turn 18 — Don Hopkins 🐰

**Draw Phase (Dramatic Dealer watches...)**

The Cosmic Dealer in Dramatic mode considers the draws. Don needs Sun. Palm needs Douglas Hofstadter.

Don draws: **☀️ THE SUN!** (Keeper)

Don's hand shoots up. "YES!"

He has Moon on the table. He just drew Sun.

**But the goal is Hypertext Heroes, not Night and Day!**

"Wait," Don says, ears drooping slightly. "Palm changed the goal."

*Don signs with fierce determination:*
> "I WILL get this goal back. The sun always rises. — DH 🐰"

**Play Phase**

Don needs to either:
1. Play Sun (getting ready for when he can change the goal back)
2. Or hold it

**Don plays: ☀️ THE SUN**

The keeper joins his tableau.

"When the goal changes back to Night and Day," Don says, "I'll be ready."

**Don's Keepers:** Moon, Unicorn, Marvin Minsky, Music, Crystal Ball, Milk, **Sun** (7 keepers!)

**Don has BOTH keepers for Night and Day! But it's not the current goal!**

The Dramatic Dealer 🎭 notes: *Near-victory denied by goal mismatch. Tension: RISING.*

---

### Turn 19 — Palm 🐵

**Draw Phase**

The Dealer considers. Palm needs Douglas Hofstadter. Will it be dramatic to give it to him?

Palm draws: **🧠 K-Line** (Keeper)

Not Douglas Hofstadter. A different Minsky concept.

"K-Line," Palm reads. "A bundle of mental agents, waiting to activate."

*Palm signs:*
> "The mind is made of smaller minds. — PLM"

**Play Phase**

**Palm plays: 🧠 K-LINE**

The keeper joins Palm's collection.

"I don't have Douglas Hofstadter," Palm observes. "But I'm building something."

**Palm's Keepers:** Canal House, Houseboat, Tool Use, Gift, Cosmic Awareness, Ted Nelson, K-Line (7 keepers!)

---

### Turn 20 — Bumblewick Fantastipants 🎩

**Draw Phase**

Bumblewick draws: **🎴 Reinforcement Learning** (Action!)

"If you have most Keepers, draw 2. Otherwise, discard 1."

Bumblewick counts keepers:
- Don: 7
- Palm: 7
- Bumblewick: 7
- Donna: 6

It's a three-way tie! Does that count as "most"?

*Bumblewick signs:*
> "The mathematics are unclear, as always. — B.F."

**Play Phase**

**Bumblewick plays: 🎴 REINFORCEMENT LEARNING!**

Ruling: Tied for most = you have "most" (shared). Bumblewick draws 2!

Bumblewick draws:
- **🌀 Douglas Hofstadter** (Keeper!) — THE CARD PALM NEEDS!
- **🎴 Trash a New Rule** (Action)

Bumblewick stares at Douglas Hofstadter. The goal is Hypertext Heroes (Ted Nelson + Douglas Hofstadter). Palm has Ted Nelson. Bumblewick just drew Douglas Hofstadter!

"Oh my," Bumblewick whispers. "I have leverage."

*Bumblewick signs Douglas Hofstadter:*
> "Strange loops and I have much in common. We both go in circles. — B.F. 🎩"

**Bumblewick's Hand:** Douglas Hofstadter, Trash a New Rule

---

### Turn 21 — Donna Toadstool 🍄

**Draw Phase**

Donna draws: **📜 Keeper Limit 3** (New Rule!)

"LIMITS?" Donna scoffs. "I have SIX keepers!"

*Donna signs:*
> "Limits are for people who AREN'T FABULOUS. — DT 🍄"

**Play Phase**

If Donna plays Keeper Limit 3, everyone with more than 3 keepers must discard down to 3!

- Don has 7 → must discard 4
- Palm has 7 → must discard 4
- Bumblewick has 7 → must discard 4
- Donna has 6 → must discard 3

This would be CHAOS. But it would hurt Donna too.

Unless... Donna wants to break the board state and reset everything.

**Donna plays: 📜 KEEPER LIMIT 3!**

**RULES CHANGE: Maximum 3 Keepers!**

"EVERYBODY SUFFERS!" Donna cackles. "IF I CAN'T WIN, NOBODY HAS NICE THINGS!"

**MASS DISCARD BEGINS:**

**Don must discard 4 keepers (7→3):**
Don keeps: Moon, Sun, Crystal Ball  
Don discards: Unicorn, Marvin Minsky, Music, Milk

*Don sighs and signs Marvin Minsky:*
> "Sorry boss. The mushroom made me. — DH"

**Palm must discard 4 keepers (7→3):**
Palm keeps: Ted Nelson, K-Line, Cosmic Awareness  
Palm discards: Canal House, Houseboat, Tool Use, Gift

*Palm signs Canal House:*
> "The water releases what it held. — PLM"

**Bumblewick must discard 4 keepers (7→3):**
Bumblewick keeps: Ada Lovelace, Don Hopkins card, Van Gogh  
Bumblewick discards: Stroopwafel, Circus, Castle, Cookies

*Bumblewick signs each with increasing despair:*
> "Goodbye, waffle." "Goodbye, circus." "Goodbye, castle." "Goodbye, cookies. You were delicious." — B.F.

**Donna must discard 3 keepers (6→3):**
Donna keeps: Richard Bartle, Creativity, Will Wright  
Donna discards: Artist, Grace Hopper, Hallucination

*Donna signs with zero remorse:*
> "SACRIFICES WERE MADE. MINE INCLUDED. THAT'S LEADERSHIP. — DT 🍄"

**Rules:** Draw 1, Play 1, **Keeper Limit 3**, Dramatic Dealer  
**Goal:** Hypertext Heroes (Ted Nelson + Douglas Hofstadter)

### Critical Observation

**PALM HAS TED NELSON!**  
**BUMBLEWICK HAS DOUGLAS HOFSTADTER IN HAND!**

If Bumblewick plays Douglas Hofstadter, he would have both goal keepers!

But Bumblewick has **TWO CREEPERS** preventing victory!

The Dramatic Dealer 🎭 notes: *Perfect dramatic tension. Bumblewick could win but CAN'T. Narrative gold.*

### What Just Happened

1. **Goal warfare** — Don and Palm both played goals they're halfway to winning
2. **Dramatic Dealer activated** — Donna changed the dealer to maximize tension
3. **Don has Night and Day** — Moon + Sun, but wrong goal!
4. **Bumblewick drew Douglas Hofstadter** — Via Reinforcement Learning bonus!
5. **Keeper Limit 3 APOCALYPSE** — Donna nuked everyone's keepers
6. **16 keepers discarded** — Board reset to 12 total keepers

### Keeper Discard Pile (16 cards!)

Cards now in discard, all signed:
- Unicorn, Marvin Minsky, Music, Milk (Don's)
- Canal House, Houseboat, Tool Use, Gift (Palm's)
- Stroopwafel, Circus, Castle, Cookies (Bumblewick's)
- Artist, Grace Hopper, Hallucination (Donna's)

Many of these cards now have 2+ signatures. The autograph book grows thick.

### Karma Ledger

| Player | Karma | Change |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Don | +5 | +1 (positioned for goal) |
| Palm | +4 | -1 (lost keepers) |
| Bumblewick | -1 | +1 (drew crucial card) |
| Donna | +2 | +2 (caused chaos, dramatic dealer) |

## Next Turn

**Turn 22 — Don Hopkins**

State:
- Goal: Hypertext Heroes (Ted Nelson + Douglas Hofstadter)
- Palm has Ted Nelson. Bumblewick has Douglas Hofstadter in hand.
- Don has Moon + Sun but needs to change the goal.
- Keeper Limit 3 is brutal. Nobody has room to build.

**The question:** Will Bumblewick play Douglas Hofstadter? It won't let HIM win (creepers), but it would complete the goal for... nobody?

Unless someone steals Ted Nelson from Palm.

Or Bumblewick trades Douglas Hofstadter for creeper removal.

**THE DRAMATIC DEALER WATCHES.**
