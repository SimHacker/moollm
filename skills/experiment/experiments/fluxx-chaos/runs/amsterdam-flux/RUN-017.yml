# 📖 GAME 8 — PALM NEEDS ONE MORE (Turns 5-12 this iteration)

  context: |
    Score: Palm 2, Don 1, Donna 1, Bumblewick 0
    Palm needs ONE MORE WIN for the championship.
    Everyone else needs to stop Palm AND win themselves.
    
    Bumblewick is 0-for-7. SEVEN GAMES without a win.
    
  dealer_notes: |
    FAFO observation: Palm is the steady favorite.
    Don keeps getting robbed. Donna had her revenge.
    
    Bumblewick... the eternal underdog...
