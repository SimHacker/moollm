    - Adapters: Don, Bowie (flow with changes)
    - Terrified: Bumblewick (fears everything)
    - Aggressive: Donna (steals everything)

  - "Bowie's persona shifts will become predictable tells"
  - "Bumblewick will have a breakthrough moment of joy"
  - "Palm will correctly predict the winner 3 turns early"
