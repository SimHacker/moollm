# 💕 VALENTINE FLUX — Initial Game State
# Run ID: valentine-flux-000
# Status: GAME START COMPLETE — Ready to Deal
#
# This is the COMPILED, FULLY EXPANDED game state.
# Created: 2026-01-31
#
# EVERYTHING IS HERE. NO EXTERNAL LOOKUPS NEEDED.
#
# PROTOCOL: ROLLING OUTPUT FILES
# Each turn produces TWO files:
#   RUN-{N}.yml  — Rolling game state (machine-readable, for LLM)
#   RUN-{N}.md   — Rolling narration (human-enjoyable prose)
#
# ALWAYS WRITE BOTH! The .yml is truth; the .md is story.
