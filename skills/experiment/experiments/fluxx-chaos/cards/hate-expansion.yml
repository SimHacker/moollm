# 🚫 HATE EXPANSION — Valentine Flux Plugin
#
# The dark side of love. Creepers that block romantic victories.
# Pair with love-expansion.yml for full Valentine Flux experience.
#
# DESIGN: Goes "full Godwin" because some things are genuinely hateable.
# The contrast makes the love cards more meaningful.
# Love is naturally more powerful than hate in this deck — mechanics reflect this.
#
# CONTENT WARNING: Contains references to real-world hate groups and figures.
# Used satirically as obstacles to overcome, not celebrated.

  id: "hate-expansion"
  name: "Hate Expansion"
  author: "Don Hopkins"
  version: "1.0"
  compatible_with: "all"
  theme: "Obstacles to love — forces that work against connection"
  
  pairs_with: "love-expansion"
  
  design_note: |
    These creepers represent the forces working AGAINST love in society.
    They're obstacles to overcome, making victories more meaningful.
    
    Every hate creeper has specific counters — love CAN defeat hate,
    but it takes effort and the right tools.
    
    Named real-world figures/groups are included because:
    1. They're genuinely hateable (not just generic "bad guy")
    2. The contrast makes love cards more precious
    3. Catharsis in defeating them with love actions
