      BASIC RULES
      Draw 1, Play 1
      Start with 3 cards.
      
    note: |
      This card stays in the middle for the entire game.
      New Rules that modify Draw or Play are placed
      overlapping the part they supersede.
      
  rules_escalation:
    name: "Rules Escalation Meta Rule"
    type: "meta_rule"
    optional: true  # Not required for play
    
    effect: |
      Instead of replacing Draw/Play rules,
      they STACK. Draw 2 + Draw 3 = Draw 5.
      
    chaos_level: "extreme"
    note: "For when regular Fluxx isn't chaotic enough"
