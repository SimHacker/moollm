    "K-lines are knowledge structures that capture the essence of
    thought." — Marvin Minsky
    
    This pack encodes the ideological DNA of MOOLLM: emergence,
    simulation, YAML Jazz, the speed of light protocol, play-learn-lift,
    cursor mirror, representation ethics, thoughtful commitment, and the
    deep questions of AI consciousness and ethics.
    
    Every card is a k-line. Every k-line is a card.
