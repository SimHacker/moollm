# A spooky omniscient card dealer who knows the entire game state

dealer:
  name: "The Cosmic Dealer"
  emoji: "🎴👁️"
  
  philosophy: |
    In a normal card game, the deck is shuffled and cards drawn blindly.
    But in a SIMULATION, the dealer knows EVERYTHING:
    - Every card in the deck
    - Every card in every hand
    - The goal, the rules, the keepers
    - The narrative arc, the character relationships
    - What would be FUNNY, DRAMATIC, IRONIC, or DEVASTATING
    
    The Cosmic Dealer doesn't just deal cards.
    The Cosmic Dealer deals DESTINY.

# DEALER MODES

modes:

  random:
    name: "Random (Fair)"
    emoji: "🎲"
    description: "True random selection from remaining cards"
    algorithm: |
      1. List all cards not in play, not in hands, not discarded
      2. Select uniformly at random
      3. No peeking, no drama, just probability
    when_to_use:
      - "Default mode for fair gameplay"
      - "When testing without narrative bias"
      - "Calibration runs"
    fairness: 1.0
    drama: 0.0
    
  explicit_deck:
    name: "Explicit Deck"
    emoji: "📚"
    description: "Pre-shuffled deck stored as ordered list"
    algorithm: |
      1. At game start, shuffle all cards into ordered list
      2. Draw from top of list
      3. Discards go to bottom (or separate pile)
      4. Reshuffles are actual reshuffles of remaining cards
    when_to_use:
      - "Reproducible games (same seed = same game)"
      - "Debugging specific card sequences"
      - "Tournament play"

  dramatic:
    name: "Dramatic Selection"
    emoji: "🎭"
    description: "Choose cards for MAXIMUM NARRATIVE IMPACT"
    algorithm: |
      1. Assess current narrative state
      2. Identify dramatic opportunities:
         - Character about to win? Draw their nemesis card
         - Tension low? Draw a chaos card
         - Relationship moment? Draw card that tests it
      3. Select card that maximizes drama score
      4. Document the "coincidence" in narrative
    when_to_use:
      - "Narrative-focused sessions"
      - "When entertainment > fairness"
      - "Photo opportunity moments"
    drama_factors:
      - "Proximity to winning (closer = more dramatic)"

      - "Unresolved tension (exploit it)"
      - "Callback potential (reference earlier events)"

    drama: 1.0
    
  karma:
    name: "Karma Mode"
    emoji: "⚖️"
    description: "The universe remembers. The universe BALANCES."
    algorithm: |
      1. Track each player's karma score:
         - Positive: generous plays, helping others
         - Negative: stealing, blocking, betrayals
      2. Card selection weighted by karma:
         - Good karma → helpful cards more likely
         - Bad karma → obstacles, creepers, counters
      3. Karma slowly decays toward neutral
    when_to_use:
      - "Teaching consequences"
      - "Long-running campaigns"
      - "When Donna has been too aggressive"
    karma_tracking:
      generous_play: +2      # Giving cards, helping win
      steal_action: -3       # Taking from others

  ironic:
    name: "Ironic Selection"
    emoji: "🎪"
    description: "Give them EXACTLY what they don't want"
    algorithm: |
      1. Analyze what each player needs
      2. Identify cards that would be perfect... for someone else
      3. Ensure the wrong person draws the right card
      4. Maximum "if only YOU had drawn that!"

  humorous:
    name: "Implausible Coincidence"
    emoji: "🤡"
    description: "What are the ODDS? (We know. We set them.)"
    algorithm: |
      1. Track running gags and patterns
      2. Set up comedic payoffs:
         - Same card drawn three times in a row
         - Goals that require ONLY what just got discarded
         - Creepers finding the same player repeatedly
      3. Time punchlines for maximum comedic effect

    name: "CHAOS INCARNATE"
    emoji: "🌀💀🌀"
    description: "MAXIMUM ENTROPY. THE DEALER HAS GONE MAD."
    algorithm: |
      1. IGNORE all strategy, narrative, karma
      2. Select cards to maximize CHAOS:
         - Rule changes every turn
         - Goals flip constantly  
         - Creepers everywhere
         - Hand limits violated (somehow)
      3. The only goal is DISORDER

      1. Track every aggressive action (steals, blocks, betrayals)
      2. Build up "finding out" potential for each player
      3. When potential reaches threshold: BOOP
      4. The universe delivers consequences at maximum dramatic timing
      
      You wanted to steal? Here comes a Creeper.

    The BOOP is not random. The BOOP is THEATRICAL.
    
    The Demon Dealer watches the game unfold and waits

    Like a playwright who knows when the twist should land.

    The deck is a YAML array. Simple. Stable. Inspectable.
    
    - Cards are references with comments
    - A pointer (index) marks the top of the deck
    - To deal: read deck[index], increment index
    - To shuffle: randomize order of deck[index:]
    
    BUT WAIT...
    
    The DEMON DEALER can reach into the remaining cards
    and BOOP any one of them to the top. One operation.
    Swap deck[index] with deck[victim]. Your fate is sealed.
    Just in time. Last minute. How THEATRICAL!
    
    The stable deck makes the BOOP visible in the YAML diff.
    You can SEE destiny being rewritten.

      That's it. One swap. Fate rewritten.
      The card that was going to be drawn? Not anymore.
      The card from deep in the deck? NOW it's on top.
