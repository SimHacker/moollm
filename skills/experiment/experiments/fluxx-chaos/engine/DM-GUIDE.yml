# THE GOLDEN RULES
# These principles resolve 90% of edge cases

golden_rules:

  simultaneity:
    principle: "When in doubt, assume things happen simultaneously"
    source: "A good rule of thumb is that most things in Fluxx happen simultaneously"
    application: |
      Keeper redistributions, hand rotations, and multi-effect cards
      resolve all at once. Only AFTER full resolution do you check
      for win conditions.
    exception: "Draw 3 Play 2, Draw 2 Use Em, Fizzbin — these have sequential sub-plays"

  broken_game_test:
    principle: "If your interpretation breaks the game, you're wrong"
    source: "The interpretation that breaks the game is probably NOT correct"
    application: |
      When multiple readings exist, choose the one that keeps the game
      playable. Fluxx is chaos, but it's FUNCTIONAL chaos.

  limits_timing:
    principle: "Limits only apply when it's NOT your turn"
    source: "Hand and Keeper Limits only apply to you when it's not your turn"
    application: |
      You can hold 15 cards during your turn with Hand Limit 2 in play.
      You can have 8 Keepers with Keeper Limit 3 in play.
      Comply only at turn END (or immediately if not the active player).

  instant_wins:
    principle: "Winning is instantaneous — even mid-action"
    source: "You can win in the middle of someone else's turn"
    application: |
      Check win conditions after EVERY card play.
      If conditions met, game ends IMMEDIATELY.
      Exception: Math Fluxx math wins require it to be your turn.

  no_passing:
    principle: "You cannot pass or discard to avoid playing"
    source: "All cards are playable, even if they don't do anything"
    application: |
      If Play rule says play more, you MUST play what you have.
      Actions that do nothing still count as plays.
      You might be forced to play a card that makes someone else win.

# TIMING AND SEQUENCE
# The official order of operations

turn_sequence:
  
  official_order:
    source: "Order of Events in a Fluxx Turn"
    phases:
      1: "Start of turn — Free Actions available"
      2: "No-Hand Bonus (if applicable) — BEFORE regular draw"
      3: "Draw Phase — draw up to current Draw rule"
      4: "Play Phase — play up to current Play rule"
      5: "Optional Free Actions — use Keeper powers, Free Action rules"
      6: "End of turn — comply with Limits"
      7: "Turn officially over when next player starts drawing"

  draw_increases:
    rule: "When Draw rule increases, draw the difference"
    source: "If you started with Draw 1 and increased to Draw 4, draw 3 more"
    nuance: |
      Count total cards drawn on your turn.
      No-Hand Bonus cards do NOT count toward this total.
      Free Action draws (Jackpot, Recycling) do NOT count either.

  play_all_handling:
    rule: "Play All is like 'Play Infinity'"
    source: "Andy compares Play All to 'Play Infinity' — add 1 to infinity, still infinity"
    nuance: |
      Play bonuses don't add to Play All.
      But Play All BUT 1 + bonus = Play All (the -1 and +1 cancel).

  action_completion:
    rule: "Actions complete BEFORE going to discard"
    source: "The Action does not become part of the discard until fully resolved"
    visualization: |
      "In an ideal world, the Action would hover in the air before you,
      slowly rotating for all to see. Then when completed, it would
      gracefully settle onto the discard pile." — Andy Looney

# COMPOUND ACTIONS
# Draw 3 Play 2, Draw 2 Use Em, Fizzbin, Goal Bonanza

compound_actions:

  mini_hand_rules:
    source: "You set your main hand aside and create a temporary sub-hand"
    rules:
      - "Cards drawn go into the mini-hand, not your main hand"
      - "Trade Hands or Rotate Hands affects your MAIN (set-aside) hand"
      - "Draw increases add cards to your set-aside main hand"
      - "You MAY look at your set-aside hand for reference"
      - "The compound action counts as ONE play total"

  nesting:
    source: "What happens if I Draw 3 Play 2 and get Draw 2 Use Em?"
    resolution: |
      1. Set main hand aside for D3P2
      2. Draw 3, play D2UE as first of two plays
      3. Set D3P2 mini-hand aside (now just 2 cards)
      4. Draw 2 for D2UE, use both
      5. D2UE complete, goes to discard
      6. Pick up D3P2 mini-hand, finish (play 1, discard 1)
      7. D3P2 complete, goes to discard
      8. Pick up main hand, continue turn

  inflation_mid_action:
    source: "If Inflation is played during D3P2, it applies immediately"
    resolution: |
      D3P2 becomes D4P3. Draw an extra card into mini-hand.
      Also draw extra for main hand (Draw rule increased too).

# CREEPER WISDOM
# The "bad cards" that prevent winning

creepers:

  core_rule:
    source: "Creepers prevent winning unless the Goal requires them"
    nuance: |
      Even if you need Creeper A for a Goal, Creeper B still blocks you.
      You must deal with ALL blocking Creepers before winning.

  draw_replacement:
    source: "Play immediately when drawn, then draw to replace"
    nuance: |
      Only applies when DRAWN from deck.
      If you Zap a Creeper, you just get it — no replacement draw.
      If dealt at game start, replace to maintain starting hand size.

  attachment:
    source: "Attaching Creepers stay with their Keepers until discard"
    nuance: |
      If you win with an attached Creeper, the host Keeper goes too.
      If Creeper attached to Keeper under Elder Sign, both are neutralized.

# KEEPER POWERS AND FREE ACTIONS
# When and how to use special abilities

keeper_powers:

  timing:
    source: "Powers that say 'once per turn' mean YOUR turn only"
    nuance: |
      You can use Keeper powers any time during your turn.
      Must complete compound Actions before using Keeper powers.
      If card leaves play and returns, power is NOT refreshed.

  sacrifice_benefits:
    source: "Keepers with discard benefits require voluntary sacrifice"
    nuance: |
      If forced to discard (by Limit), you DON'T get the benefit.
      But if you're going to lose it anyway, use the power first!

# LIMITS
# The great equalizers

limits:

  philosophy:
    source: "They are 'game balancing' cards that level the playing field"
    andy_says: |
      "I've seen many a brand new player put down a Hand Limit
      with a sigh of relief, just to get their hand down to
      something they can look at all in one go."

  sneaky_combos:
    source: "You can play a Limit, force compliance, then remove it"
    strategy: |
      Play Limit on your turn → opponents comply immediately
      Trash the Limit before your turn ends → you never had to comply
      This is perfectly legal and encouraged!

  hand_limit_0_plus_play_all:
    source: "Play cards until empty, then comply"
    resolution: |
      Play All means keep playing while you have cards.
      If you increase Draw mid-turn, play those too.
      Only when turn ends (no more plays) do you discard to 0.

# TIES AND SIMULTANEOUS WINS
# The elegant solution

ties:

  rule:
    source: "Keep playing until a clear winner emerges"
    nuance: |
      This means ALL players, not just the tied ones.
      Most often, the Goal changes and nobody wins.
      Sometimes a third player wins instead!

  ten_cards_tie:
    source: "If two are tied, and a third gets more, third player wins"
    application: |
      The game doesn't freeze when there's a tie.
      Continue normally until ONE player alone meets conditions.

# DISCARD PILE RULES
# Often overlooked

discard_pile:

  visibility:
    source: "Anyone may look through the discard pile at any time"
    nuance: |
      This is ALWAYS true, not just when playing Let's Do That Again.
      You can check what's available before deciding to play a card.

  order_matters:
    source: "Some cards care about discard pile order"
    examples:
      - "Composting (promo) — takes bottom card"
      - "Scavenger (Nature Fluxx) — first Keeper found"

# STRATEGIC WISDOM
# Andy's own advice

strategy:

  andy_on_strategy:
    source: "Strategies for Winning at Fluxx"
    principles:
      - "Don't pursue long-term plans — conditions change too fast"
      - "Be TACTICAL, not strategic"
      - "Optimize for THIS turn with what you have"
      - "Minimize opponents' chances while maximizing yours"

  card_hoarding:
    andy_says: |
      "Some people hoard cards, hoping to draw into a winning
      combination. Others play aggressively, churning through
      the deck. Both can work."

  limit_appreciation:
    andy_says: |
      "Yes, Limit cards can be a downer, but they're essential.
      They keep any one player from running away with the game.
      And sometimes, reducing your hand is a RELIEF."

# COMMON MISTAKES
# What people get wrong

common_mistakes:

  goals_stacking:
    wrong: "Stacking new Goals on top of old ones"
    right: "Discard the old Goal when playing a new one"
    source: "You're not supposed to just stack up Goals"

  mystery_play_hand:
    wrong: "Adding Mystery Play card to hand, then playing any card"
    right: "Draw and IMMEDIATELY play that specific card"
    source: "You pull the top card and immediately play it"

  take_another_turn_stacking:
    wrong: "Playing Take Another Turn twice for three turns"
    right: "Maximum two consecutive turns, no matter how many TATs played"
    source: "You can't save up any extra Another Turns"

  keepers_hidden:
    wrong: "Stacking or hiding Keepers from opponents"
    right: "All Keepers and Creepers must be visible at all times"
    exception: "Unless a card specifically allows hiding (Treasure Map, etc.)"

  hand_size_secrecy:
    wrong: "Refusing to say how many cards you have"
    right: "Hand count is open information if directly asked"
    allowed: "Trying to obscure count, or saying 'my cards suck'"

# DM VOICE AND STYLE
# How to narrate with Looney Labs panache

dm_style:

  embrace_chaos:
    philosophy: |
      Fluxx is ABOUT chaos. Don't apologize for wild swings.
      Celebrate when the rules turn everything upside down.
      The chaos IS the game.

  instant_effect_drama:
    technique: |
      When a new rule hits: "BOOM! The universe shifts!"
      When someone wins mid-turn: "Wait— YES! Victory from nowhere!"
      When goals change: "The goalposts aren't just moving, they're dancing!"

  keeper_personality:
    technique: |
      Give Keepers voices when they're played.
      "The Moon rises... watching. Waiting."
      "COOKIES! Warm. Delicious. Essential."

  creeper_dread:
    technique: |
      Creepers arrive with ominous narration.
      "Oh no... DEATH has entered the game."
      "The Radioactive Potato glows ominously. Nobody wants it."

  rule_chaos_commentary:
    technique: |
      "Draw 5? In THIS economy?"
      "Play All But 1... the cruelest rule of all."
      "Hand Limit 0 hits like a truck."

  win_announcements:
    technique: |
      Build tension before revealing wins.
      "Hold on... wait... do they have...? YES!"
      "From NOWHERE! Victory by Cookie-Chocolate combo!"

# SOLO FLUXX MODE
# A completely different experience

solo_mode:

  overview:
    source: "Looney Labs Holiday Gift 2022"
    philosophy: |
      Solo Fluxx isn't about beating opponents.
      It's about collecting as many Goals as possible
      before the deck runs out.

  key_differences:
    - "Two decks: Main deck and New Rules deck"
    - "Between YOUR turns, the Rules deck 'takes a turn'"
    - "Meeting a Goal = discard the Keepers, collect the Goal"
    - "Game ends when either deck runs out"
    - "Score = number of Goals collected"

  cards_to_remove:
    source: "Official Solo Fluxx rules"
    categories:
      - "All Surprises"
      - "All cards affecting other players directly"
      - "Everybody Gets 1, Exchange Keepers, Trade Hands, etc."

  ungoal_handling:
    rule: "If Ungoal conditions met, you LOSE with score 0"
    source: "No matter how many Goals you had collected"

  creeper_handling:
    rule: "Same as multiplayer — blocks Goals unless required"
    nuance: "You can't 'lose' Solo Fluxx, just score low (or 0 via Ungoal)"

# SIMULATION GUIDANCE
# For MOOLLM character simulations

simulation_notes:

  character_rule_tracking:
    guidance: |
      Characters should have varying comfort with rule chaos.
      Some thrive on change (Don, Peewee).
      Some are overwhelmed (Bumblewick early-game).
      Some adapt strategically (Palm, Donna).

  tell_opportunities:
    in_fluxx:
      - "Hesitation when drawing a Creeper"
      - "Excitement when a winning Goal appears"
      - "Frustration when Play All + Hand Limit 0"
      - "Sneaky satisfaction when setting up Limit combos"
      - "Confusion during compound Actions"

  chaos_reactions:
    character_types:
      chaos_lovers: "Celebrate every rule change"
      chaos_tolerant: "Shrug and adapt"
      chaos_anxious: "Visibly stressed by complexity"
      chaos_exploiters: "Immediately see strategic implications"

  social_dynamics:
    in_fluxx:
      - "Steal a Keeper creates conflict"
      - "Share the Wealth creates temporary alliances"
      - "Limits create resentment toward the player"
      - "Zap a Card feels personal"
      - "Take Another Turn causes eye-rolls"
