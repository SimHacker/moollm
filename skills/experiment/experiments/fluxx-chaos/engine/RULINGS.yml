# DRAW PHASE RULINGS

draw_rulings:

  no_hand_bonus:
    ruling: "Draws from No-Hand Bonus do NOT count toward Draw rule"
    source: "These cards make up a 'new hand' simulating you had cards BEFORE your turn"
    example: |
      Draw 5 in effect, you qualify for No-Hand Bonus:
      Draw 3 (bonus) + Draw 5 (rule) = 8 cards total
      
  bonus_then_increase:
    ruling: "If you increase Draw after using No-Hand Bonus, you still draw the difference"

    ruling: "Draws from Free Actions (Jackpot, Recycling) don't count toward Draw total"
    source: "These are 'extra' and don't affect how many you've 'officially' drawn"

    consequence: "You might be forced to play a card that makes opponent win"
    
  action_does_nothing:
    ruling: "An Action that does nothing is still a valid play"
