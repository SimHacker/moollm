  philosophy: |
    Every card is a PORTAL, not just a game piece.
    
    Click on any card → pie menu appears with options to:
    - Learn more about what the card represents
    - See its connections to other cards
    - Explore its k-line relationships
    - Generate/view its artwork
    - Hear its story
    - Understand its strategy
    
    The game becomes an interactive encyclopedia.
    Play is learning. Learning is play.

  yaml_jazz_card:
    card: "YAML Jazz"
    
    tell_me_more_response: |
      # YAML Jazz 🎷
      
      **What it represents:** YAML Jazz is Don Hopkins' philosophy that
      YAML comments aren't just documentation — they carry SEMANTIC WEIGHT.
      Structure provides the skeleton; comments provide the SOUL.
      
      **Why it's in MOOLLM:** This is a core k-line. Every YAML file in
      MOOLLM uses comments as a parallel data channel. The comment
      "# Watches other players' chip stacks obsessively" isn't just
      describing the field — it's CHARACTER DATA the LLM uses.
      
      **Cultural connection:** Like jazz musicians improvising over
      chord changes, YAML Jazz adds spontaneous meaning over rigid
      structure. The structure is the chart; the comments are the solo.
      
      **K-line relationships:**
      - Double-barrel meaning (data + documentation)
      - Sniffable interfaces (CARD.yml → SKILL.md)
      - Play-Learn-Lift (informal → captured → shared)
      
      **Surprising fact:** The saxophone emoji 🎷 was chosen because
      jazz improvisation IS structured freedom — exactly like semantic
      comments in strict YAML format.

  stroopwafel_card:
    card: "Stroopwafel"
    
    tell_me_more_response: |
      # Stroopwafel 🧇
      
      **What it represents:** A stroopwafel is a Dutch waffle cookie
      made from two thin layers of baked dough with caramel syrup
      in the middle. Traditionally, you place it on top of a hot
      cup of coffee to warm the caramel.
      
      **Why it's in MOOLLM:** The Amsterdam expansion captures Dutch
      culture, and stroopwafels are iconic. They also represent
      GEZELLIGHEID — that untranslatable Dutch coziness of sharing
      good things with good people.
      
      **Cultural connection:** Stroopwafels originated in Gouda in
      the late 18th century. A baker made them from leftover crumbs
      sweetened with syrup — waste became treasure.
      
      **K-line relationships:**
      - Cheese Wheel: Both Dutch food keepers
      - Gezelligheid rule: Sharing culture
      - Don Hopkins: Known Amsterdam visitor
      
      **Pro tip:** In real life, a stroopwafel must be EXACTLY the
      right size to cover a coffee cup. Too small and it falls in.
      Too large and it doesn't warm evenly. Precision matters.

      **Don Hopkins** ❤️❤️❤️
      LOVES it. Reminds him of Amsterdam trips. Would absolutely
      share with everyone at the table. Probably brought some.
      
      **Palm** ❤️
      Appreciates the craftsmanship. The patience of warming it
      on coffee appeals to his contemplative nature.
      
      **Bumblewick** ❤️❤️
      The sweetness comforts his anxiety. Also, it's small enough
      for a bee to enjoy. Takes notes on caramel physics.
      
      **Donna** 🤷
      "It's FINE. I prefer POWER FOODS. But I won't say no."
