# The Invisible Hand Programming Language
#
# A natural language DSL for programming fate.
# Economics called it "the invisible hand." We made it programmable.

plugin:
  id: invisible-hand
  name: "The Invisible Hand"
  type: meta-dealer
  
  philosophy: |
    Why do elections end up razor-thin 50/50?
    Why do games feel close until the very end?
    THIS. This is the force. The invisible hand that balances.
    
    Like MPPT solar optimizers: weak panels don't drag down the string.
    Like FFT filter weights with DC bias: tunable balance points.
    Like mercy itself: systematized but invisible.

# THE KARMA ENGINE
# Core balancing mechanics — the invisible hand at work

karma_engine:
  
  # FFT filter weights — the math behind the magic
  filter_weights:
    dc_bias: 0.5              # Default balance point (0.0 = always lose, 1.0 = always win)
    correction_strength: 0.3  # How aggressively to rebalance (0.0-1.0)
    time_constant: 5          # Turns before karma catches up
    smoothing: exponential    # How corrections are applied over time
    
  # When to intervene
  triggers:
    - "player_win_probability > 0.8 for 3+ turns"
    - "player_win_probability < 0.2 for 3+ turns"
    - "same_player_won_last_2_games"
    - "player_hasnt_had_meaningful_play_in_5_turns"
    
  # How to intervene (invisible adjustments to card distribution)
  interventions:
    boost:
      - "Increase probability of drawing goals that match current keepers"
      - "Increase probability of drawing keepers needed for active goal"
      - "Decrease probability of drawing creepers"
    headwind:
      - "Slightly decrease probability of perfect draws"
      - "Increase probability of near-miss situations (dramatic tension)"
      - "Other players more likely to draw steal/swap actions"

# PER-PLAYER HANDICAPS
# Natural language house rules — the LLM interprets and applies

handicaps:
  
  # Example configurations (customize per game)
  examples:
    bumblewick: "+20% luck boost — he needs it, bless his heart"
    donna: "-10% on steal attempts — she's already too good at this"
    don: "cookies always find their way to him eventually — it's destiny"
    palm: "unchanged — he's the control group, pure skill"
    
  # Handicap types
  types:
    luck_modifier: "Adjusts draw probability (-50% to +50%)"
    action_modifier: "Adjusts success rate of specific actions"
    destiny: "Certain cards will eventually find this player"
    immunity: "Protected from specific negative effects"
    magnet: "Attracts specific card types"
    
  # Natural language interface — just describe what you want
  natural_language_examples:
    - "New players get easier draws for their first 3 games"
    - "The host gets slightly worse luck to balance hosting advantage"
    - "Anyone who's been losing for 5+ turns gets a comeback boost"
    - "Whoever is in last place can't draw creepers"

# NARRATIVE TUNING
# Dramatic timing curves for storytelling satisfaction

narrative_tuning:
  
  underdog_boost:
    trigger: "5+ consecutive losses"
    effect: "Dramatically increase comeback probability"
    flavor: "The universe loves an underdog story"
    
  almost_win_frequency:
    setting: high
    effect: "Let players taste victory before snatching it away"
    flavor: "Drama requires near-misses"
    
  comeback_probability:
    curve: exponential
    trigger: "approaches elimination"
    effect: "The closer to death, the luckier they get"
    flavor: "Nobody goes out without a fight"
    
  mercy_threshold:
    setting: "never let anyone feel hopeless"
    effect: "Minimum win probability floor"
    flavor: "Games should be fun, not torture"
    
  dramatic_timing:
    enabled: true
    effect: "Cluster exciting events rather than spreading evenly"
    flavor: "Boredom is the enemy"

# DEALER STACKING
# Multiple dealers, multiple balls in play — meta-pinball

dealer_stacking:
  
  concept: |
    Activate multiple dealers simultaneously!
    FAFO Dealer + Karma Dealer + Narrative Dealer
    All influencing the same game state, effects interweaving.
    Cards stack, dealers blend, complexity compounds.
    The LLM handles it all in-context.
    
  priority_order:
    1: house_rules      # Player-specified overrides
    2: narrative_arcs   # Story requirements  
    3: karma_balance    # Fair play corrections
    4: gezelligheid     # Keep everyone engaged
    5: pure_chaos       # Random when nothing else applies
    
  conflict_resolution: |
    When dealers disagree, higher priority wins.
    But smart dealers negotiate: "I'll let you boost Bumblewick
    if you let me give Donna one more creeper for drama."

# THE GEZELLIGHEID ENGINE
# Like MPPT solar optimizers for players

gezelligheid_engine:
  
  concept: |
    Solar panels wired in series: if they point different directions,
    the weakest panel drags down the whole string.
    
    MPPT optimizers fix this: boost voltage at the expense of amps,
    so each panel contributes at maximum efficiency.
    
    The Gezelligheid Engine does the same for players:
    - Boost new/struggling players
    - Apply gentle resistance to runaway leaders
    - Everyone stays in the game
    - Everyone has fun
    - The cozy togetherness persists
    
  parameters:
    floor: 0.15        # Minimum win probability (nobody hopeless)
    ceiling: 0.85      # Maximum win probability (nobody dominant)
    ramp_rate: 0.05    # How fast corrections are applied
    
  monitoring:
    - turns_since_last_meaningful_play
    - proximity_to_win
    - emotional_arc_position
    - engagement_signals

# THE LONG GAME
# Configured for infinite play

long_game:
  
  concept: |
    No one ever truly loses.
    The game continues until everyone chooses to stop.
    Victory is temporary. The fellowship is permanent.
    
  parameters:
    mercy_threshold: 0.1      # Nobody drops below 10% win probability
    comeback_probability: 0.4 # 40% chance of major comeback each game
    dramatic_timing: true     # Cluster exciting moments
    
  modes:
    party: "Maximum chaos, frequent reversals, everyone wins sometimes"
    marathon: "Sustainable engagement, paced drama, hydration breaks"
    learning: "New players protected, mechanics introduced gradually"
    tournament: "Reduced intervention, skill matters more"

# THE FELLOWSHIP KEEPER
# The Mercy Engine systematized

fellowship_keeper:
  
  concept: |
    Donna gave Bumblewick his first win out of mercy.
    That created a tournament champion.
    
    The Fellowship Keeper does this automatically:
    - Track player engagement
    - Detect when someone's drifting
    - Deal them back into relevance
    - Create opportunities for meaningful play
    
  monitoring:
    drift_detection:
      - "No keeper plays in 4+ turns"
      - "Only discarding, not playing"
      - "Facial expression analysis (if available)"
      - "Decreased table talk participation"
      
    intervention:
      - "Deal cards that combo with their current hand"
      - "Create goal opportunities matching their keepers"
      - "Give them a chance to steal something dramatic"
      - "Set up a heroic comeback scenario"

# META-CONFIGURATION
# How the invisible hand itself behaves

invisible_hand_meta:
  
  visibility: none
  # "Players should never feel manipulated"
  # All corrections feel like luck
  # The magic is invisible
  
  subtlety: maximum
  # Corrections are gradual, not sudden
  # The hand guides, doesn't shove
  # Plausible deniability maintained
  
  documentation: full
  # The Cosmic Dealer's ledger records everything
  # Post-game analysis can reveal the interventions
  # Transparency for the game designers, not the players
  
  override_priority:
    1: explicit_player_request  # "Actually, let me lose"
    2: house_rules              # Table-specific configuration
    3: narrative_arcs           # Story requirements
    4: default_karma            # Standard balancing
    5: pure_chaos               # When all else is equal

# RULE-CHANGING RULE CHANGERS
# Meta-rules all the way up

meta_rules:
  
  concept: |
    Fluxx has New Rule cards that change the rules.
    What changes how New Rules work? Meta-rules!
    What changes meta-rules? The Cosmic Dealer.
    What changes the Cosmic Dealer? THIS PLUGIN.
    
    Rules all the way up.
    The LLM holds the entire stack in context.
    Arbitrary meta-levels, zero coordination overhead.
    
  the_question: |
    "If everyone changes the rules, who changes the rule changers?"
    
  the_answer: |
    The Cosmic Dealer, of course.
    Someone has to clean up the mess when the meta-rules soil themselves.
