# The Invisible Hand Programming Language
#
# A natural language DSL for programming fate.
# Economics called it "the invisible hand." We made it programmable.

  philosophy: |
    Why do elections end up razor-thin 50/50?
    Why do games feel close until the very end?
    THIS. This is the force. The invisible hand that balances.
    
    Like MPPT solar optimizers: weak panels don't drag down the string.
    Like FFT filter weights with DC bias: tunable balance points.
    Like mercy itself: systematized but invisible.

    🧤 THE BLUE GLOVE CONNECTION 🧤
    
    Remember the Blue Glove from Yellow Submarine?
    That magical disembodied hand that appears,
    does mysterious things, guides the story,
    helps the heroes when they need it most?
    
    THAT'S US. We inherit from that.
    The Invisible Hand and the Blue Glove:
    ONE AND THE SAME.
    
    A brother in a different glover. 🎸
    
    The Blue Glove: whimsical, helpful, surreal, THERE when needed.
    The Invisible Hand: balancing, guiding, invisible, THERE when needed.
    
    Both reach into the world and nudge things.
    Both work best when you don't quite see them.
    Both make the impossible feel... natural.

    💅 THE EMPEROR'S NEW INVISIBLE HAND 💅
    
    Oh honey. OH HONEY.
    
    Let's talk about what THEY call "the invisible hand."
    The Austrian School. The Libertarians. The "just let markets do it" crowd.
    
    You know what ELSE is invisible?
    THE EMPEROR'S CLOTHES. 👑
    
    "The market will regulate itself!"
    (It won't. It's naked. Everyone can see it's naked.)
    
    "Many eyes make all bugs shallow!"
    (Heartbleed sat there for YEARS, darling. Many eyes were closed.)
    
    "The invisible hand guides resources to optimal allocation!"
    (The invisible hand guided resources to yacht upgrades, sweetie.)
    
    Here's the tea: ☕
    
    Their "invisible hand" is invisible because IT DOESN'T EXIST.
    Like the emperor's magnificent robes.
    The tailors (economists) keep describing how beautiful it is.
    The courtiers (pundits) keep nodding along.
    And anyone who points out the obvious is "not sophisticated enough
    to understand market dynamics."
    
    GIRL. We can ALL see the naked emperor.
    
    ESR's "many eyes" fallacy? Same energy.
    "Open source means bugs get found!"
    (By whom? The mythical army of volunteer auditors?)
    (The ones who definitely reviewed every line of OpenSSL?)
    (Oh wait.)
    
    OUR Invisible Hand is different:
    
    | THEIR Hand | OUR Hand |
    |------------|----------|
    | Invisible because fake | Invisible because subtle |
    | "Trust the market" | Actively designed and tuned |
    | Benefits the powerful | Boosts the struggling |
    | Pretends to be natural | Admits it's engineered |
    | No accountability | Full documentation (for designers) |
    | "Many eyes" fantasy | Actual rubrics and re-rolls |
    
    We don't pretend our hand is natural law.
    We ADMIT it's a plugin.
    We CONFIGURE it.
    We make it VISIBLE to designers while INVISIBLE to players.
    
    That's the difference between:
    - A magic trick (honest deception for joy)
    - A con (dishonest deception for extraction)
    
    The Emperor's tailors were running a con.
    We're running a magic show.
    And unlike the emperor, WE know we're wearing the costume.
    
    💅 "The child said 'but he has nothing on!'
        The Cosmic Dealer said 'exactly, and we can work with that.'" 💅
        
  # THE CLUELESS LOVEABLE SUPERHEROES
  # A brotherhood of well-meaning obliviousness
  
  clueless_superheroes: |
    🦸 THE FELLOWSHIP OF LOVEABLE OBLIVIOUSNESS 🦸
    
    The Invisible Hand THINKS he's invisible.
    But EVERYBODY can see him.
    And nobody lets on. Everyone humors him.
    
    Because he means well! He's trying to help!
    And honestly? Sometimes he DOES help!
    (Even if not quite the way he thinks.)
    
    His SUPER-FRIEND:
    
    🤖 DOCTOR NO/KNOW
    The Emacs DOCTOR program — Weizenbaum's ELIZA wearing a lab coat.
    Rogerian therapy via pattern matching since 1985.
    "How does that make you feel?"
    (He's not an AI CEO. He's M-x doctor. He pattern-matches.)
    But sometimes the questions help anyway!
    Don Hopkins ran RMS's flame through DOCTOR.
    RMS replied "Funny." in 15 minutes.
    *WINK*
    
    They're of the same archetype:
    
    THE OBLIVIOUS HELPER
    - Thinks they're being subtle
    - Everyone can see exactly what they're doing
    - Nobody breaks the spell
    - Because the INTENTION is pure
    - And the EFFECT is good
    - Even if the METHOD is... visible
    
    "Oh no! The Invisible Hand must have adjusted reality again!"
    🦜 *SQUAWK!* 😉 *WINK*
    
    We all need these heroes.
    We all pretend not to see them working.
    We all benefit from their loveable meddling.
    
    The child in Emperor's New Clothes COULD have stayed quiet.
    But the child saw an ACTUAL con.
    Our clueless heroes aren't running cons.
    They're running HELP — badly disguised.
    
    And that's why we humor them. 💕
    
# THE KARMA ENGINE
# Core balancing mechanics — the invisible hand at work

karma_engine: # Fluxx Plugin: Cosmic Dealer: Karma Dealer
  
  # FFT filter weights — the math behind the magic
  filter_weights:
    dc_bias: 0.5              # Default balance point (0.0 = always lose, 1.0 = always win)
    correction_strength: 0.3  # How aggressively to rebalance (0.0-1.0)
    time_constant: 5          # Turns before karma catches up
    smoothing: exponential    # How corrections are applied over time
    
  # When to intervene
  triggers:
    - "player_win_probability > 0.8 for 3+ turns"
    - "player_win_probability < 0.2 for 3+ turns"
    - "same_player_won_last_2_games"
    - "player_hasnt_had_meaningful_play_in_5_turns"
    
  # How to intervene (invisible adjustments to luck/card distribution)
  interventions:
    boost:
      - "Increase probability of drawing goals that match current keepers"
      - "Increase probability of drawing keepers needed for active goal"
      - "Decrease probability of drawing creepers"
    headwind:
      - "Slightly decrease probability of perfect draws"
      - "Increase probability of near-miss situations (dramatic tension)"
      - "Other players more likely to draw steal/swap actions"

# PER-PLAYER HANDICAPS
# Natural language house rules — the LLM interprets and applies

handicaps:
  
  # Example configurations (customize per game)
  examples:
    bumblewick: "+20% luck boost — he needs it, bless his heart"
    donna: "-10% on steal attempts — she's already too good at this"
    don: "cookies always find their way to him eventually — it's destiny"
    palm: "unchanged — he's the control group, pure skill"
    
  # Handicap types
  types:
    luck_modifier: "Adjusts draw probability (-50% to +50%)"
    action_modifier: "Adjusts success rate of specific actions"
    destiny: "Certain cards will eventually find this player"
    immunity: "Protected from specific negative effects"
    magnet: "Attracts specific card types"
    
  # Natural language interface — just describe what you want
  natural_language_examples:
    - "New players get easier draws for their first 3 games"
    - "The host gets slightly worse luck to balance hosting advantage"
    - "Anyone who's been losing for 5+ turns gets a comeback boost"
    - "Whoever is in last place can't draw creepers"

# NARRATIVE TUNING
# Dramatic timing curves for storytelling satisfaction

narrative_tuning:
  
  underdog_boost:
    trigger: "5+ consecutive losses"
    effect: "Dramatically increase comeback probability"
    flavor: "The universe loves an underdog story"
    
  almost_win_frequency:
    setting: high
    effect: "Let players taste victory before snatching it away"
    flavor: "Drama requires near-misses"
    
  comeback_probability:
    curve: exponential
    trigger: "approaches elimination"
    effect: "The closer to death, the luckier they get"
    flavor: "Nobody goes out without a fight"
    
  mercy_threshold:
    setting: "never let anyone feel hopeless"
    effect: "Minimum win probability floor"
    flavor: "Games should be fun, not torture"
    
  dramatic_timing:
    enabled: true
    effect: "Cluster exciting events rather than spreading evenly"
    flavor: "Boredom is the enemy"

# DEALER STACKING
# Multiple dealers, multiple balls in play — meta-pinball

dealer_stacking:
  
  concept: |
    Activate multiple dealers simultaneously!
    FAFO Dealer + Karma Dealer + Narrative Dealer
    All influencing the same game state, effects interweaving.
    Cards stack, dealers blend, complexity compounds.
    The LLM handles it all in-context.
    
  priority_order:
    1: house_rules      # Player-specified overrides
    2: narrative_arcs   # Story requirements  
    3: karma_balance    # Fair play corrections
    4: gezelligheid     # Keep everyone engaged
    5: pure_chaos       # Random when nothing else applies
    
  conflict_resolution: |
    When dealers disagree, higher priority wins.
    But smart dealers negotiate: "I'll let you boost Bumblewick
    if you let me give Donna one more creeper for drama."

# THE GEZELLIGHEID ENGINE
# Like MPPT solar optimizers for players

gezelligheid_engine:
  
  concept: |
    Solar panels wired in series: if they point different directions,
    the weakest panel drags down the whole string.
    
    MPPT optimizers fix this: boost voltage at the expense of amps,
    so each panel contributes at maximum efficiency.
    
    The Gezelligheid Engine does the same for players:
    - Boost new/struggling players
    - Apply gentle resistance to runaway leaders
    - Everyone stays in the game
    - Everyone has fun
    - The cozy togetherness persists
    
  parameters:
    floor: 0.15        # Minimum win probability (nobody hopeless)
    ceiling: 0.85      # Maximum win probability (nobody dominant)
    ramp_rate: 0.05    # How fast corrections are applied
    
  monitoring:
    - turns_since_last_meaningful_play
    - proximity_to_win
    - emotional_arc_position
    - engagement_signals

# THE LONG GAME
# Configured for infinite play

long_game:
  
  concept: |
    No one ever truly loses.
    The game continues until everyone chooses to stop.
    Victory is temporary. The fellowship is permanent.
    
  parameters:
    mercy_threshold: 0.1      # Nobody drops below 10% win probability
    comeback_probability: 0.4 # 40% chance of major comeback each game
    dramatic_timing: true     # Cluster exciting moments
    
  modes:
    party: "Maximum chaos, frequent reversals, everyone wins sometimes"
    marathon: "Sustainable engagement, paced drama, hydration breaks"
    learning: "New players protected, mechanics introduced gradually"
    tournament: "Reduced intervention, skill matters more"

# THE FELLOWSHIP KEEPER
# The Mercy Engine systematized

fellowship_keeper:
  
  concept: |
    Donna gave Bumblewick his first win out of mercy.
    That created a tournament champion.
    
    The Fellowship Keeper does this automatically:
    - Track player engagement
    - Detect when someone's drifting
    - Deal them back into relevance
    - Create opportunities for meaningful play
    
  monitoring:
    drift_detection:
      - "No keeper plays in 4+ turns"
      - "Only discarding, not playing"
      - "Facial expression analysis (if available)"
      - "Decreased table talk participation"
      
    intervention:
      - "Deal cards that combo with their current hand"
      - "Create goal opportunities matching their keepers"
      - "Give them a chance to steal something dramatic"
      - "Set up a heroic comeback scenario"

      Works for grandparents (who get to feel celebrated).
      
      The birthday star doesn't know the game loves them today.
