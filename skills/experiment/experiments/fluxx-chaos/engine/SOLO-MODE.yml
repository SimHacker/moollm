# Solo Fluxx Mode
# Official solitaire variant — Looney Labs Holiday Gift 2022
# A completely different game experience

solo_mode:
  name: "Solo Fluxx"
  created: "2022"
  creator: "Andy Looney"
  origin: "Holiday Gift to fans"
  
  philosophy: |
    For decades, fans asked for a solo option. Until 2022, all Andy
    could suggest was adding imaginary players. Then he cracked it:
    
    Split the deck. The RULES take turns too.
    
    It's not about beating opponents — it's about collecting Goals
    before the deck runs out.

# SETUP

setup:
  
  deck_separation:
    step_1: "Remove all Surprises"
    step_2: "Remove all 'other player' cards (see removal list)"
    step_3: "Separate remaining cards into two decks"
    
  two_decks:
    new_rules_deck:
      contains: "All New Rule cards"
      placement: "Face down in corner"
      
    main_deck:
      contains: "Everything else (Keepers, Goals, Actions, Creepers)"
      placement: "Face down, separate from Rules deck"
      
  initial_hand:
    draw: 3
    from: "Main deck only"
    
  layout:
    zones:
      - "Rules Deck (upper left)"
      - "Rules Discard Pile"
      - "Basic Rules (always visible)"
      - "Limit Rule slot"
      - "Draw Rule slot"
      - "Play Rule slot"
      - "All Other Rules area"
      - "Goal slot"
      - "Main Deck"
      - "Main Discard Pile"
      - "Your Keepers area"
      - "Scored Goals pile"

# TURN SEQUENCE

turn_sequence:
  
  overview: |
    Alternate between YOUR turn and the RULES turn.
    Think of the Rules deck as an opponent that only changes rules.
    
  your_turn:
    1: "Draw from Main deck (per current Draw rule)"
    2: "Play from hand (per current Play rule)"
    3: "Check for Goal completion"
    4: "Comply with Limits"
    
  rules_turn:
    1: "Draw top card from New Rules deck"
    2: "Place in appropriate slot"
    3: "If slot occupied, discard old rule to Rules Discard"
    4: "If new Limit, comply before your next turn"
    
  turn_token:
    recommendation: |
      Use a token to track whose turn it is.
      Helps avoid confusion about when to draw from which deck.

# WINNING AND SCORING

scoring:
  
  goal_collection:
    trigger: "When you meet a Goal's conditions"
    action: |
      - Discard the Keepers (and Creepers) required
      - Move the Goal card to your Scored Goals pile
      - This is your score
    optional: "Collecting Goals is optional (important for 10 Cards In Hand)"
    
  game_end:
    trigger: "When you need to draw but a deck is empty"
    which_deck: "Either Main deck OR New Rules deck"
    immediate: "Game ends that instant"
    
  scoring:
    win: "At least 1 Goal collected = you win"
    score: "Total Goals collected"
    record: "Track personal best per Fluxx version"
    
  ungoal:
    trigger: "If Ungoal conditions are ever met"
    result: "You LOSE — score is 0"
    regardless: "Even if you had collected Goals"

# CARD HANDLING

card_handling:

  move_to_other_player:
    rule: "Move to Discard pile instead"
    source: "There is no other player"
    
  trade_rotate_hands:
    rule: "Remove these cards before playing"
    reason: "No one to trade with"
    
  steal_cards:
    rule: "Remove Steal a Keeper, etc."
    reason: "No one to steal from"
    
  empty_the_trash:
    rule: "Does NOT affect Rules discard pile"
    source: "Only reshuffles Main discard into Main deck"
    
  discard_pile_visibility:
    rule: "You may look at either discard pile anytime"
    
  first_card_random:
    rule: "Works fine in solo"
    technique: "Turn hand face-down, shuffle, pick top card"

# CREEPER HANDLING

creepers:
  
  blocking:
    rule: "Same as multiplayer — blocks Goals unless required"
    nuance: "You can't 'lose' solo, just score low"
    
  attached_creepers:
    rule: "Follow host Keeper to discard when claiming Goal"
    
  multiple_creepers:
    rule: "Can still win if Goal requires ALL Creepers you have"
    blocking: "But if one blocks, you can't claim that Goal"

# SIMULATION NOTES

simulation_notes:
  
  solo_character:
    concept: |
      Solo Fluxx is perfect for simulating a character's
      internal monologue while playing alone.
      
    opportunities:
      - "Reaction to rule changes (frustration, relief)"
      - "Strategic thinking about Goal collection"
      - "Memory of past plays and patterns"
      - "Relationship with 'the Rules' as antagonist"
      
  narrative_hooks:
    rules_as_opponent: |
      "The Rules drew... Hand Limit 0. Of course they did."
      "The universe seems determined to make this difficult."
      
    goal_decisions: |
      "I COULD collect this Goal, but I'd lose my best Keepers..."
      "Is one point worth sacrificing my position?"
      
    deck_anxiety: |
      "Main deck is getting thin. How many turns do I have left?"
      "That was the last New Rule. The chaos is... frozen."
      
  difficulty_by_version:
    easiest: "Fluxx 5.0, Family Fluxx, Cat/Dog Fluxx (no Creepers)"
    medium: "Star Fluxx, Pirate Fluxx (some Creepers)"
    hardest: "Cthulhu Fluxx, Zombie Fluxx (Creepers + Ungoals)"
    impossible_tier: "Tiny Fluxx (Andy got 1 point in 5-6 games)"
