  description: |
    Valentine's Day themed Fluxx deck combining sweet romantic mechanics
    with disruptive "hate cards" representing forces working against love.
    
    A TRIBUTE to the Stanford Generative Agents paper, where Valentine's Day
    party emergence from a single seed demonstrated believable social simulation.
    We're running the same experiment but with MOOLLM characters and
    speed-of-light multi-agent simulation.
    
  design_philosophy: |
    Goes "full Godwin" because some things are genuinely hateable, and the
    contrast makes the love cards more meaningful. Love is naturally more
    powerful than hate in this deck — the game mechanics reflect this.
    
  location:
    room: pub/games/
    table: pie-menu-table-8-seats
    context: |
      Plucked from pub game collection, reconfigured and customized for
      simulated pub patrons. The Gezelligheid Grotto's Valentine's party.
      
  moollm_connection: |
    "Try to do that, The Sims!"
    Unlike The Sims, MOOLLM can:
    - Fully describe the assembled deck in YAML
    - Pre-shuffle and track card indices
    - Cache game state in the RUN INSTANCE
    - Inherit from base experiment, customize locally
    - Generate coherent narrative from gameplay

# HOW TO RUN
#
# The full game state is ready in:
#   ../fluxx-chaos/runs/valentine-flux/RUN-000.yml
#
# To continue the game:
#   1. Read RUN-000.yml (168 cards, 5 players, pre-deal state)
#   2. Deal 3 cards to each player
#   3. Don takes first turn
#   4. Generate RUN-001.yml (state) and RUN-001.md (narration)
#   5. Continue until someone wins (or Valentine's Day Massacre triggers)
#
# Each turn produces:
#   RUN-{N}.yml — Machine-readable game state
#   RUN-{N}.md  — Human-enjoyable narrative
