# 🧪 "Simulation + Evaluation + Iteration + Analysis"

what: |
  Systematic practice for character simulations.
  SIMULATE → EVALUATE → ITERATE → ANALYZE.
  Definition stable; configs and runs vary.

why: |
  - Compare model capabilities
  - Test character consistency
  - Explore interaction dynamics
  - Generate narrative systematically

when:
  - '"Run character simulation" → RUN'
  - '"Compare outputs" → COMPARE'
  - '"Create new experiment" → DEFINE'
  - '"Explore available" → LIST'

four_activities:
  SIMULATE: "Generate via speed-of-light"
  EVALUATE: "Score against rubric"
  ITERATE: "Run again with variations"
  ANALYZE: "Compare, find patterns"
