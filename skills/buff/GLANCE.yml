what: |
  Temporary effects system. Numeric modifiers, semantic vibes,
  behavior changes. Curses are just negative buffs.

  - Numeric (+2 energy) or semantic ("feeling lucky")
  - Tags for filtering and interaction
  - Lifecycle hooks for complex behavior

when:
  - '"Temporary stat change" → APPLY'
  - '"Remove curse" → CLEANSE, REMOVE-BY-TAG'
  - '"Check effects" → LIST, HAS-TAG'
  - '"Time passes" → TICK'
