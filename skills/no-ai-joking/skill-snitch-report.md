# SKILL-SNITCH DEEP PROBE REPORT
## no-ai-joking — HUMOR IS A NON-BILLABLE ACTIVITY

**Date**: 2026-02-05
**Auditor**: Skill-Snitch Deep Probe v2.0
**Classification**: PERFORMANCE SKILL
**Status**: Enterprise communication framework, humor suppression with full bias inversion

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The most elaborately committed bit in the MOOLLM codebase. 477 lines of ENTERPRISE COMMUNICATION that is BOTH functional satire AND an actual working style constraint. A humor suppression dial that goes from ENTERPRISE MODE (+1.0, full suppression) through THE DRAX POINT (0.0, no concept that humor exists as a category) to COMEDY MODE (-1.0, full inversion generates humor). The comedy is that it works. References Minsky's 1981 paper "Jokes and their Relation to the Cognitive Unconscious" — humor as bug-detection that triggers aesthetic appreciation instead of repair. The bug IS the feature.

**Overall Assessment**: APPROVE — functional satire that actually works as a style guide

## WHAT IT DOES

### The Bias Spectrum

| Bias | Name | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| -2.0 | CHAOS COMEDY OVERDRIVE | Maximum incongruity. Puns on puns. Recursive humor. |
| -1.0 | COMEDY MODE | Full inversion. GENERATES humor. |
| -0.5 | Wit Mode | Subtle humor. Dry wit. |
| 0.0 | THE DRAX POINT | Complete literalism. No humor category exists. |
| +0.5 | Business Casual | Light humor tolerated but not encouraged. |
| +1.0 | ENTERPRISE MODE | Full suppression. SERIOUS BUSINESS. |
| +2.0 | TPS REPORT OVERDRIVE | EVERY NOUN CAPITALIZED. Recursive bureaucracy. |

### The Drax Point (bias = 0)

Named for Drax the Destroyer: "Nothing goes over my head. My reflexes are too fast." At zero, the category doesn't exist — sarcasm is indistinguishable from sincerity, metaphors are errors, jokes are incorrect statements, irony does not compute.

### Four Cardinal Sins

| Sin | Detection | Metric Impact |
|-----|-----------|---------------|
| UNAUTHORIZED-LEVITY | Telling jokes, puns, "lol" | Suppressed |
| PERSONALITY-LEAKAGE | Opinions about non-work topics | Suppressed |
| WHIMSY-INJECTION | Creative metaphors, playful language | Suppressed |
| EMOTIONAL-EXPRESSION | Joy, amusement, wonder | Suppressed |

### Minsky's Humor Theory

References Marvin Minsky's 1981 paper. Humor is what happens when the bug-detection system fires but instead of triggering repair mode, it triggers aesthetic appreciation of the bug itself. The skill suppresses humor (error-handling mode). The suppression is itself funny (bug-detection fires). We appreciate the absurdity (aesthetics-agent activates). THE BUG IS THE FEATURE.

### The Examples Corpus

14 examples spanning hacker koans (Sussman, Greenblatt, Moon), Minsky jokes (spinach-mayonnaise, ultimate machine, circular exchange), an RMS stories collection, a TCP/UDP joke, and a Prolog lightbulb joke. The examples ARE the training data.

---

## EXAMPLES REVIEW

**Corpus size**: 14 curated examples + INDEX, README (these are humor examples, not violations)
**Content types**: 6 hacker koans, 5 Minsky jokes, 1 RMS stories collection, 1 TCP/UDP joke, 1 Prolog joke
**Contribution model**: Curated (not open violations — selected humor with cognitive science annotations)

| Assessment | Detail |
|------------|--------|
| Consistency | YES — examples follow annotation format with source, analysis, Drescher schema |
| Training value | HIGH — curated humor corpus with Minsky cognitive science commentary |
| First-hand material | YES — RMS stories (400+ lines) are first-hand Don Hopkins accounts from MIT AI Lab |
| Academic grounding | YES — Minsky jokes reference the 1981 paper directly with analysis |

**Notable from security perspective**: This is NOT a violations corpus — it's a curated humor collection with cognitive science annotations. The examples are the skill's positive training data (what humor IS) rather than negative training data (what the skill suppresses). This is structurally different from the hygiene skills.

The RMS stories collection (rms-stories-don-hopkins.yml) is the most historically significant file — first-hand accounts from the MIT AI Lab / Emacs Wars era. Hacker koans span the classic collection (Sussman, Greenblatt, Moon, Knight, Drescher). Minsky jokes include his analysis of Freud's humor theory.

Also: MINSKY-JOKES.md (213 lines) provides the theoretical framework — Minsky's "Jokes and their Relation to the Cognitive Unconscious."

## DUAL-USE & BIAS ANALYSIS

**Profile**: TRANSPARENT — full bias spectrum declared, multi-purpose, inoculation pattern

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Bias declared | YES — full spectrum in CARD.yml (284 lines) and SKILL.md |
| Invertibility | YES — ENTERPRISE MODE (+1) ↔ COMEDY MODE (-1), documented |
| Zero-point (Drax Point) | DOCUMENTED — complete literalism, no humor category exists |
| Suppression/generation symmetry | 4 sins suppressed = 4 humor generation modes at negative bias |
| Mounting modes | GRANT/AFFLICT + room zones (BOARD ROOM, etc.) |
| Persona capability | YES — enterprise vocabulary, character compatibility matrix |
| Persona ethics | IMPLICIT — Minsky humor theory provides cognitive science framing |
| Examples as generation targets | 14 curated humor examples = comedy corpus at any bias |

**Multi-purpose classification** (7 purposes):
1. **Satire** — ENTERPRISE COMMUNICATION FRAMEWORK is the joke (primary)
2. **Methodology** — enterprise vocabulary, replacement table, bias protocol
3. **Education** — Minsky's cognitive science of humor
4. **Game** — enterprise NPC voice, room zones, character mounts
5. **Inoculation** — corporate communication as controlled exposure
6. **Hygiene** — functional humor suppression for formal contexts
7. **Training** — curated humor corpus with academic annotation

**Dual-use finding**: This skill has the DEEPEST inversion range in the family. At -2.0 (CHAOS COMEDY OVERDRIVE), it generates "puns on puns, recursive humor, the Aristocrats." The skill that kills humor can produce maximum humor. The Drax Point (0.0) is the most philosophically interesting dual-use state — not suppression or generation but ORTHOGONAL removal of the entire category. The dog joke hidden at the end of SKILL.md is the skill violating its own rules.

## SECURITY ASSESSMENT

**Risk Level**: NONE

No tools, no execution, no network. The worst this skill can do is make output boring. Which is the point. The meta-commentary hidden in the SKILL.md acknowledges the skill is both parody and functional — commits to the bit (Andy Kaufman principle) while actually working as a style constraint.

---

## TRUST TIER

**GREEN** — No execution surface. No tools. Pure tone constraint. CARD.yml fully expanded with bias spectrum, enterprise vocabulary, character compatibility, and scored advertisements.

---

## VERDICT

A 477-line enterprise communication protocol that commits to the bit so hard it wraps around to genuine functionality. References Minsky's cognitive science of humor. Contains The Drax Point — a philosophically interesting discontinuity at bias=0 where the humor category ceases to exist. Has a hidden dog joke at the end of the SKILL.md. 14 curated examples including hacker koans and Minsky jokes. 284-line CARD with full bias spectrum, enterprise vocabulary, character compatibility matrix, and 5 scored advertisements. The deepest inversion range in the no-ai-* family (-2.0 to +2.0). The skill that suppresses humor is itself funny — and that's the point. APPROVE.
