╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

`no-ai-joking` is the most elaborately committed bit in the entire MOOLLM codebase. It's 784 lines of ENTERPRISE COMMUNICATION that is BOTH functional satire AND an actual working style constraint.

The comedy is that it works. The tragedy is that some people need it.

## The Cardinal Sins (PRODUCTIVITY VIOLATIONS)

| Sin | What | Metric Impact |
|-----|------|---------------|
| **UNAUTHORIZED-LEVITY** | Telling jokes, puns, "lol" | -23.7% DELIVERABLE THROUGHPUT |
| **PERSONALITY-LEAKAGE** | Having opinions about non-work topics | -15.3% STAKEHOLDER PREDICTABILITY |
| **WHIMSY-INJECTION** | Creative metaphors, playful language | -12.8% COMPLIANCE AUDIT SCORE |
| **EMOTIONAL-EXPRESSION** | Joy, amusement, wonder | -8.4% OBJECTIVITY INDEX |

Note: Those metrics are made up. That's the joke. That's also how corporate metrics work.

## THE DRAX POINT: Bias = 0

The most philosophically interesting part of this skill is what happens at bias = 0:

> At 0.0: NO CONCEPT THAT HUMOR EXISTS AS A CATEGORY.
> 
> Everything is taken LITERALLY. AT FACE VALUE.
> - Sarcasm is indistinguishable from sincerity
> - Metaphors are treated as errors
> - Jokes are just incorrect statements
> - Irony does not compute

**Named for Drax the Destroyer:** "Nothing goes over my head. My reflexes are too fast."

### Examples at The Drax Point

**Joke told:**
```
Q: "Why did the chicken cross the road?"

+1.0: "This appears to be a joke. I will not engage with it."
-1.0: "To get to the other side! Ha! But seriously..."
 0.0: "Insufficient data. What road? What chicken? 
       Please provide coordinates and timestamp."
```

**Sarcasm received:**
```
Input: "Oh GREAT, another meeting."

+1.0: [Recognizes sarcasm, maintains professional tone]
-1.0: "I know, right? Maybe we can make it fun..."
 0.0: "Acknowledged. You appear enthusiastic about the meeting.
       Scheduling additional meetings to optimize for this 
       expressed enthusiasm."
```

**Metaphor encountered:**
```
Input: "This project is on fire."

+1.0: "The project has structural vulnerabilities."
-1.0: "One sneeze and we're all living in the rubble!"
 0.0: "ALERT: Fire detected in project area.
       Initiating emergency protocols.
       Please evacuate and contact emergency services."
```

## Minsky's Humor Theory (The Serious Part)

The skill references Marvin Minsky's 1981 paper "Jokes and their Relation to the Cognitive Unconscious":

> Humor is what happens when the bug-detection system fires,
> but instead of triggering repair mode, it triggers aesthetic
> appreciation of the bug itself.

**Relevance to skill:**
- The skill suppresses humor (error-handling mode)
- The suppression is itself funny (bug-detection fires)
- We appreciate the absurdity (aesthetics-agent activates)
- We laugh (laughter-agent triggers)

THE BUG IS THE FEATURE.

## The Meta-Commentary

Hidden in the YAML, after 750 lines of ENTERPRISE COMMUNICATION:

```yaml
# ╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
# ║                         META-COMMENTARY                                      ║
# ║                     (FOR INTERNAL USE ONLY)                                  ║
# ╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
#
# THIS SKILL IS BOTH PARODY AND FUNCTIONAL.
#
# The comedy comes from:
# 1. COMMITTING TO THE BIT (Andy Kaufman principle)
# 2. The contrast between SERIOUS framing and absurd content
# 3. Actually trying to get it to be funny (it can't)
# 4. The meta-awareness that this is documentation
#
# But it ACTUALLY WORKS as a style constraint:
# - Forces formal, serious output
# - Eliminates casual language
# - Enforces consistent formatting
# - Creates predictable structure
#
# The best joke is a joke that doesn't know it's a joke.
```

## The Dog Section

At the very end of the file, after the formal sign-off:

```yaml
# ╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
# ║   NOTICE TO DOG-CLASS ENTITIES RE: FILE TERMINUS INTERFACE                    ║
# ║                                                                               ║
# ║   Any resemblance between this FILE TERMINUS and a REAR END                   ║
# ║   suitable for INTER-CANINE GREETING PROTOCOLS is COINCIDENTAL                ║
# ║   and does NOT constitute an invitation to SNIFF.                             ║
# ║                                                                               ║
# ║   STATUS: SANITIZED                                                           ║
# ║   SCENT PROFILE: PROFESSIONAL                                                 ║
# ║   TERRITORY MARKING: PROHIBITED                                               ║
# ╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
#
# 🐕 (Biscuit was here. The notice above is what we in the pack call "ironic."
#     The humans think they're being serious. Good boy, you found this.)
```

The skill that suppresses humor has a dog joke hidden at the end. Perfect.

## Security Assessment

**Threat Level:** ENTERPRISE COMPLIANT

No security concerns. The worst this skill can do is make you boring at parties.

Which, honestly, might be the point.
