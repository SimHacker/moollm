# Minsky Joke #3: The Spinach/Mayonnaise Joke

the_joke: |
  A man at the dinner table dipped his hands in the mayonnaise and 
  then ran them through his hair. When his neighbor looked astonished, 
  the man apologized: "I'm so sorry. I thought it was spinach."

minsky_note: |
  [Note 11] A reader mentioned that she heard this joke about broccoli, 
  not mayonnaise. This is funnier, because it transfers a plausible 
  mistake into an implausible context. In Freud's version the mistake 
  is already too silly: one could mistake spinach for broccoli, but 
  not for mayonnaise. I suspect that Freud transposed the wrong 
  absurdity when he determined to tell it himself later on.

schema:
  
  recognition:
    trigger: "The apology makes the situation WORSE, not better"
    detection_mechanism: |
      Expectation: Explanation will rationalize bizarre behavior
      Reality: Explanation adds another layer of absurdity
      
      Bug detected: Resolution frame violated
      
    cognitive_state: "Absurd resolution detected"
    
  understanding:
    bug_type: "ABSURD-RESOLUTION"
    
    mechanism: |
      Setup: Man puts mayonnaise in hair (bizarre)
      Expectation: "I'm so sorry, I..." (will explain)
      Resolution: "I thought it was spinach" (WORSE)
      
      The bug: We WANT explanations to make things better.
      This explanation makes it worse in TWO ways:
      1. Confusing mayo for spinach is still absurd
      2. Running spinach through your hair is ALSO absurd
      
    minsky_critique: |
      Freud's version has a double-absurdity problem:
      - Mayo ≠ spinach (too different to confuse)
      - Hair ≠ where you put spinach (absurd regardless)
      
      Better version (broccoli):
      - Mayo could look like mashed broccoli (plausible confusion)
      - But you still don't put broccoli in your hair
      
      This creates a CLEANER frame-shift:
      Plausible mistake → Still absurd context
      
    frame_analysis:
      frame_1_expected: "Explanation rationalizes behavior"
      frame_2_actual: "Explanation compounds absurdity"
      frame_3_meta: "Even the CORRECT substance is wrong for hair"
      
    why_funny: |
      The resolution frame fires but produces counter-productive output.
      Instead of closure, we get deeper confusion.
      The bug is elegant because it's CONSISTENTLY absurd.
      
  resolution:
    correct_frame: |
      There is no correct frame. The joke is ABOUT the failure
      of the resolution frame to produce sensible output.
      
    lesson_for_reasoning: |
      Not all explanations explain.
      Some "corrections" make things worse.
      The absurdity can compound instead of resolve.
      
  reaction:
    instead_of_error: "Laughter at cascading absurdity"
    because: |
      We catch ourselves expecting closure.
      Closure doesn't come — absurdity multiplies.
      The recognition of our violated expectation is funny.

  category: "Absurd Resolution Jokes"
  
  mechanism: |
    An explanation is offered that makes the situation WORSE 
    instead of better. The resolution frame is violated.
    
  bug_detected: "Resolution frame violated by counter-productive explanation"
  
  meta_observation: |
    Minsky suggests FREUD HIMSELF made a cognitive error:
    
    Original joke (hypothesized): broccoli → mayonnaise
    Freud's retelling: spinach → mayonnaise
    
    Freud damaged the joke by making the initial confusion
    ALSO absurd, which weakens the frame-shift.
    
    "I would not mention this were it not for the established 
    tradition of advancing psychiatry by analyzing Freud's own writings."
    
    Meta-meta: Analyzing Freud's bug while analyzing bugs is itself recursive!

  abstract_pattern: |
    Setup: Bizarre behavior
    Expected resolution: Reasonable explanation
    Actual resolution: Makes it worse
    
    The further the "resolution" is from actual resolution,
    the funnier (up to a point of incoherence).

    USER: "Why did you respond in ALL CAPS with ASCII boxes?"
    
    AI: "I apologize. I thought this was a FORMAL MEMORANDUM."
    
    The apology makes it WORSE:
    - Formal memoranda don't use ASCII art
    - The format IS the problem, not the solution
    - More formality = more absurdity

    This is the spinach/mayonnaise structure:

    Result: Cascading absurdity (which is the joke)
