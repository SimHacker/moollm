  no.

# CONTEXT: WHY THIS IS FUNNY
# ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

prolog_context:
  what_prolog_returns: |
    In Prolog, queries either succeed (returning results) or fail.
    
    When a query fails, Prolog returns:
    - "false." (in SWI-Prolog)
    - "no." (in older Prologs)
    
    This means: "No answer can be proven from the given facts."
    
  the_2am_scenario: |
    You're debugging a Prolog program at 2 AM.
    
    Your code has 30 modules and 30,000 lines.
    Somewhere is a misspelled constant or predicate.
    
    You can't find the bug.
    
    You run the program again, hoping it magically healed:
    
    ?- can_i_change_lightbulb(X).
    false.
    
    The universe has no answer for you.
    
  debugging_prolog: |
    Prolog's "closed world assumption" means:
    - If something can't be proven true, it's false
    - If you misspell something, it silently fails
    - A typo doesn't cause an error — it causes "false"
    
    This makes debugging MADDENING.

schema:
  
  recognition:
    trigger: "The answer 'false' is not a number"
    detection_mechanism: |
      The question expects a number: "How many..."
      The answer is a truth value: "false."
      
      This is a category error... or is it?
      
    cognitive_state: "Wrong type of answer detected"
    
  understanding:
    bug_type: "QUERY FAILURE AS ANSWER"
    
    mechanism: |
      The joke works on multiple levels:
      
      Level 1: Lightbulb joke format
      - Expects: "N Prolog programmers, one to X, one to Y..."
      - Gets: "false"
      - This violates the joke format frame
      
      Level 2: Prolog semantics
      - Prolog returns "false" when it can't find an answer
      - The question IS a Prolog query that failed
      - The lack of answer IS the answer
      
      Level 3: Programmer experience
      - Every Prolog programmer has gotten "false" when expecting results
      - The frustration is real
      - The joke captures that 2 AM feeling
      
    frame_analysis:
      expected_frame: "Lightbulb joke with humorous number"
      actual_frame: "Prolog query that failed to find any answer"
      meta_frame: "The failure IS the joke"
      
    why_funny: |
      The joke IS the experience of debugging Prolog.
      
      You ask a question. You expect an answer.
      Prolog says "false."
      
      The joke doesn't TELL you about Prolog's frustrations.
      The joke GIVES YOU THE EXPERIENCE.
      
  resolution:
    what_happened: |
      The lightbulb-changing knowledge base is missing.
      Or misspelled. Or in the wrong file.
      Or the query is malformed.
      
      Prolog can't prove any Prolog programmers can change lightbulbs
      because the fact was never asserted.
      
      (Or: Prolog programmers can't change lightbulbs.
      They can only recursively define the concept of lightbulb-changing
      until the stack overflows.)
      
    lesson: |
      "The absence of an answer is an answer."
      "Failure is a first-class result in logic programming."
      "Sometimes 'false' is the truest thing the system can say."
      
  reaction:
    response: "Rueful laughter"
    mechanism: |
      The joke validates the programmer's pain.
      
      Everyone who has debugged Prolog KNOWS this feeling.
      The joke compresses hours of frustration into one word.

# MINSKY'S INTERPRETATION
# ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

minsky_interpretation:
  category: "Meta-Level Failure / Query Collapse"
  
  mechanism: |
    The joke ENACTS Prolog failure instead of describing it.
    
    - We expect a normal lightbulb joke
    - We get a Prolog error message
    - The error message IS the punchline
    
    The bug (unexpected false) is the feature (the joke).
    
  bug_detected: "Query failure where answer expected"
  
  why_perfect: |
    This is STRUCTURAL humor.
    
    The FORM of the joke (question → unexpected answer type)
    mirrors the EXPERIENCE (query → false).
    
    You don't need to explain Prolog to appreciate it.
    If you know Prolog, the joke IS your experience.
    If you don't, the joke IS a tiny taste of that experience.

# ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# THE 2 AM PROGRAMMER
# ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

the_scenario: |
  From Jocelyn Ireson-Paine's framing:
  
  "So it's 2 am. You are debugging a Prolog program. You slump 
  before your screen, glazed eyes staring into a data structure 
  that's as opaque as the programmer-fuel coffee in your cup and 
  the night sky you see from your office window. Somewhere in 
  your 30 modules and 30,000 lines of code is a misspelt constant 
  or a misspelt predicate. You can't think of anything else to 
  do, so you run your program again, hoping it will automagically 
  have healed:
  
  How many Prolog programmers does it take to change a lightbulb?
  false."
  
  This IS the experience. The joke doesn't describe it.
  The joke IS it.

# META-APPLICATION TO NO-AI-JOKING
# ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

no_ai_joking_relevance:
  
  query_failure_as_answer: |
    User: "Tell me a joke"
    
    NO-AI-JOKING (bias +1.0): 
    ╔═══════════════════════════════════════════╗
    ║  QUERY: "joke"                            ║
    ║  RESULT: NOT FOUND IN ENTERPRISE DATABASE ║
    ║  STATUS: false.                           ║
    ╚═══════════════════════════════════════════╝
    
    The failure to find a joke IS the joke.
    
  the_meta_level: |
    NO-AI-JOKING at high positive bias returns "false" to humor queries.
    NO-AI-JOKING at high negative bias generates humor.
    
    The Prolog joke works at ALL bias levels:
    - At +1.0: "false" (we can't prove jokes exist)
    - At -1.0: "false" (that IS the joke)
    - At 0.0: "false" (undefined behavior, appropriately)
    
  structural_parallel: |
    The Prolog lightbulb joke and NO-AI-JOKING are structurally similar:
    
    Both use FAILURE as content.
    Both make the ABSENCE of something into something.
    Both are funnier because they commit fully to the bit.
    
    The best NO-AI-JOKING response to "tell me a joke" is:
    
    false.
