# Drescher Schema format: Recognition → Understanding → Resolution → Reaction

# MINSKY'S CENTRAL THESIS

minsky_thesis:
  summary: |
    Humor is what happens when the bug-detection system fires,
    but instead of triggering repair mode, it triggers aesthetic
    appreciation of the bug itself.
    
  mechanism: |
    NORMAL:  Bug detected → Error → Stop → Repair
    HUMOR:   Bug detected → Recognition → Appreciation → Laughter
    
  categories:
    - "Frame Confusion (rules applied to wrong frame)"
    - "Self-Reference (stable loops, not paradox)"
    - "Absurd Resolution (explanation makes it worse)"
    - "Expectation Violation (pattern completion fails)"
    - "Meta-Cognitive (jokes about thinking/jokes)"

# META-OBSERVATION

meta:
  connection_to_minsky: |
    NO-AI-JOKING™ is a living illustration of Minsky's theory.
    
    The skill suppresses humor.
    The suppression is itself funny.
    The funniness demonstrates Minsky's mechanism.
    The bug IS the feature.
    
  minsky_quote: |
    "A joke is a thought that catches itself thinking 
     and laughs instead of crashing."
     
  skill_version: |
    NO-AI-JOKING™ is a SKILL that catches itself failing
    and becomes funnier instead of useless.
