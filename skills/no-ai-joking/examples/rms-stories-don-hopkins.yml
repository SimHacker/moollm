# These are true stories, not fiction. The humor emerges from:
#   - RMS's legendary quick wit
#   - The surreal reality of MIT AI Lab culture
#   - Category violations between social norms and hacker norms
#
# Context: Don Hopkins worked at UniPress on the Emacs display driver for NeWS,
# the PostScript-based window system. UniPress sold "Gosling Emacs" — the enemy
# in the Emacs Wars. Yet RMS and the "Evil Software Hoarders" were friends who
# hung out at science fiction conventions.

# STORY 1: THE HOUSE FIRE JOKE
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

house_fire_joke:
  
  the_story: |
    I worked at UniPress on the Emacs display driver for the NeWS window system
    (the PostScript based window system that James Gosling also wrote), with
    Mike "Emacs Hacker Boss" Gallaher, who was in charge of Emacs development
    at UniPress.
    
    One day during the 80's Mike and I were wandering around an East coast
    science fiction convention, and ran into RMS, who's a regular fixture
    at such events.
    
    Mike said: "Hello, Richard. I heard a rumor that your house burned down.
    That's terrible! Is it true?"
    
    RMS replied right back:
    
      "Yes, it did. But where you work, you probably heard about it in advance."
    
    Everybody laughed. It was a joke! Nobody's feelings were hurt.
    He's a funny guy, quick on his feet!
    
  clarification: |
    Yes, his house actually did burn down, but we didn't set it on fire,
    hire someone else to do it, or even know about it in advance.

      mechanism: |
        RMS plays with frames:
        - Frame 1: Expressing sympathy for tragedy
        - Frame 2: Emacs Wars rivalry (UniPress = enemy)
        - Frame 3: Conspiracy theories about corporate sabotage
        
        The joke collapses all three frames into one deadpan accusation
        that is CLEARLY absurd but delivered with perfect timing.
        
    resolution:
      why_funny: |
        - The accusation is simultaneously: sincere sympathy acknowledgment,
          mock accusation, and self-deprecating acceptance of the tragedy
        - "Where you work" = UniPress = commercial Emacs = the enemy
        - The deadpan delivery makes it unclear for a split second
        - Everyone knows it's absurd, which makes the timing land

# STORY 2: THE GERBIL JOKE

  the_story: |
    Here's a photo I took of RMS holding a gerbil wrapped in duct tape,
    just before he asked:
    
      "I don't know, why DO you wrap a gerbil in duct tape?"

      mechanism: |
        The classic "gerbil duct tape" joke is notoriously dark.
        The punchline involves... well, Google it.
        
        But the META-JOKE is:
        - RMS is HOLDING what appears to be the setup prop
        - He's asking YOU to complete the joke
        - The humor is in the social transgression of the setup itself
        
    resolution:
      why_funny: |
        - Shock value of the prop
        - Feigned innocence of "I don't know, why DO you..."
        - The invitation to complicity
        - RMS's deadpan delivery style

# STORY 3: THE PLANTS DEFENSE SYSTEM
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

plants_defense:
  
  the_story: |
    I know Star Simpson personally (the freshman who quoted the MIT upperclassman
    who said female CSAIL professors kept plants in their offices to repel RMS).
    
    And RMS has personally asked me to hold the branches of bushes that were
    leaning into a sidewalk out of the way so that he could pass by.
    
    So yes, I'm pretty sure first hand that RMS is afraid of trees and bushes
    and foliage, among other quirks, and it's pretty widely known around the
    people who have lived and worked and hung out with him.
    
  corroboration: |
    From Devon (RMS's housemate for many years):
    
    "People of all genders at the AI/LCS lab hung ferns in their offices
    to keep RMS away."
    
    Devon also confirms that RMS let him have the largest bedroom in the house
    because it had a menacing tree outside the window that RMS was afraid of.

    understanding:
      bug_type: "ABSURD-REALITY"
      mechanism: |
        The humor comes from the REALITY being absurd:
        - A legendary hacker afraid of plants
        - Professors using FERNS as a defense system
        - Someone asking you to hold bushes out of their way
        
        It's not a joke. It's TRUE. The truth is the joke.
        
    resolution:
      why_funny: |
        - Category violation: Technical genius ≠ afraid of plants
        - The pragmatic adaptation: office plants as RMS-deterrent
        - The image of RMS unable to pass a bush without assistance

# STORY 4: RMS VS DOCTOR (EMACS PSYCHOTHERAPY)
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

rms_vs_doctor:
  
  the_story: |
    And here's a transcript of a bunch of people telling RMS to fuck off
    because they didn't appreciate his pointed joke about the Evils of Natalism,
    which I then fed to Doctor in Emacs to psychoanalyze him.
    
  context: |
    M-x doctor is the Emacs psychotherapist, an implementation of ELIZA.
    Feeding RMS's words to ELIZA creates a recursive meta-joke:
    - RMS's controversial statements
    - Analyzed by software he helped create
    - Using Rogerian therapy techniques
    - On a text editor

        - Creating a "therapy session"
        
    resolution:
      why_funny: |
        The MEDIUM is the message:
        - RMS analyzed by RMS's software
        - Therapy parody applied to real controversy

    An excerpt from a September 1986 email from Don's friend who lived
    with RMS in the house with the menacing tree:
    
  excerpt: |
    "RMS as God (or, why isn't the world made out of decayed slugs?)
    
    What can I say? All three of us moved out of [address redacted] because
    there was no way in hell to get him to move. This is a man who has
    created an operating system people worship slavishly as a "perfect
    environment", but who claims he must continue to use everyone else's
    towel because he doesn't know where to buy one himself.
    
    This is a man who talks about immorality and considerateness, and
    claimed it was a "special favor" to take his boots off at the top of
    the stairs like the rest of us and not track mud through the living
    room where we all roamed barefoot.
    
    This is a man who let me have the best bedroom in the house because
    there were trees outside the window and he was afraid of them.
    
    [...] 
    
    Yet I still hear people I love and respect talk about him as if he
    were some kind of deity, as if his Free Software Foundation were the
    noblest effort in the world. It is admirable, yes. But to glorify the
    thoroughly sick human being behind it into some sort of whole-life
    messianic figure is unconscionable."

        - "Afraid of trees"

        Not exactly funny — more REVEALING.
        The category of "genius" and "functional adult" don't overlap.
        The dissonance is uncomfortable but illuminating.

      RMS is a central figure in software ideology.
      These stories humanize/complicate the legend.
      The humor comes from the gap between ideology and person.
      
  rms_as_character:

      - "Socially unconventional in ways that become folklore"
      
    archetype: |
      RMS is both:
      - A legendary figure in computing
      - A source of endless anecdotes
      - A walking category violation
      - Himself a kind of cognitive bug that the system appreciates

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# META-OBSERVATION
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

meta:
  why_these_matter: |
    These aren't just funny stories — they're ORAL HISTORY.
    
    The Hacker Koans preserve wisdom in koan form.
    These RMS stories preserve the CULTURE in anecdote form.
    
    Both document a specific time and place:
    - MIT AI Lab
    - Early ARPANET (when host numbers were 8 bits)
    - Before "Flag Day" 1983 (NCP → TCP/IP)
    - Science fiction convention culture
    - The Emacs Wars
    
  minsky_connection: |
    Minsky's humor theory:
    "Humor is the aesthetic appreciation of cognitive bugs."
    
    RMS IS a cognitive bug that the community aesthetically appreciates.
    
    The stories aren't mockery — they're affection.
    The category violations aren't failures — they're features.
    The community that tells these stories is the same community
    that uses the software and reads the manifestos.
    
  authenticity: |
    Don Hopkins emphasizes throughout:
    - "I believe the women, and my own eyes and ears."
    - Multiple corroborating witnesses
    - Photos as evidence
    - 35-year-old emails
    
    These are RECEIPTS, not rumors.

  "Yes, it did. But where you work, you probably heard about it in advance."
  
  That's the joke. That's the whole joke.
  
  Quick, deadpan, absurd, contextual, friendly, accusatory, self-deprecating,
  and absolutely perfectly timed.
  
  That's RMS humor.
  That's MIT AI Lab humor.
  That's hacker humor.
  
  And now you've heard about it.
  
  (Probably not in advance.)
