the_koan: |
  A student, in hopes of understanding the Lambda-nature, came 
  to Greenblatt. As they spoke a Multics system hacker walked by.
  
  "Is it true", asked the student, "that PL/I has many of the 
  same data types as Lisp?"
  
  Almost before the student had finished his question, Greenblatt 
  shouted, "FOO!", and hit the student with a stick.
  
  With this, he was enlightened.

schema:
  
  recognition:
    trigger: "Violence and nonsense word instead of answer"
    detection_mechanism: |
      The student asks a technical question.
      Greenblatt responds with:
      - A nonsense word ("FOO!")
      - Physical violence (stick)
      
      This is NOT a conventional answer.
      
    cognitive_state: "What just happened?"
    
  understanding:
    bug_type: "FRAME DESTRUCTION / ZEN SHOCK"
    
    mechanism: |
      The student's question contains hidden assumptions:
      - PL/I and Lisp are comparable
      - Data types are the important thing
      - Understanding Lambda-nature comes through comparison
      
      Greenblatt's response destroys the frame entirely:
      - "FOO" is meaningless (like the question's premise)
      - The stick breaks the intellectual mode
      - Violence forces immediate presence
      
      The Multics hacker walking by is the trigger:
      Multics represents the "other way" (systems programming).
      The student is distracted by comparisons.
      Greenblatt brings them back to HERE AND NOW.
      
    frame_analysis:
      student_frame: "Understanding comes through comparison"
      greenblatt_frame: "Understanding comes through direct experience"
      zen_frame: "If you meet the Buddha on the road, kill him"
      
    why_funny: |
      The absurdity of the response (FOO + stick) 
      is perfectly disproportionate to the academic question.
      
      We laugh at the violence of the non-answer,
      then recognize the question deserved it.
      
  resolution:
    what_is_foo: |
      "FOO" is a metasyntactic variable in programming:
      - foo, bar, baz are placeholder names
      - They mean "any example"
      - They are deliberately meaningless
      
      Greenblatt shouts the SOUND of meaninglessness.
      
    why_the_stick: |
      In Zen tradition, the "keisaku" (warning stick) is used
      to bring students to sudden awareness.
      
      The student was lost in comparison (PL/I vs Lisp).
      The stick brings immediate presence.
      
      "Is PL/I like Lisp?" is the wrong question.
      The stick is the right answer.
      
    lambda_nature: |
      The student wanted to understand "Lambda-nature"
      through intellectual comparison.
      
      Lambda-nature (the essence of Lisp, of functional programming,
      of computation itself) cannot be understood through comparison
      to PL/I. It must be EXPERIENCED directly.
      
      Greenblatt gave direct experience: FOO! *whack*
      
  reaction:
    response: "Enlightenment"
    mechanism: |
      The violence and absurdity BREAK the analytical frame.
      The student stops comparing and starts BEING.
      
      The koan works because it can't be understood analytically.
      You have to experience the confusion → resolution.

# ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# MINSKY'S INTERPRETATION
# ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

minsky_interpretation:
  category: "Frame Destruction / Direct Transmission"
  
  mechanism: |
    Minsky would recognize this as:
    1. Student has wrong frame (comparison mode)
    2. Teacher destroys frame violently
    3. In the absence of frame, direct understanding possible
    
    The bug-detection fires on Greenblatt's response.
    But the real bug was the student's question.
    
  bug_detected: "Analytical comparison as path to understanding"
  
  why_foo: |
    "FOO" is perfect because it means nothing.
    It's a variable waiting to be bound.
    The student's categories (PL/I, Lisp, data types) 
    are also variables waiting to be bound to experience.
    
    Greenblatt shows this by shouting the archetypal
    meaningless placeholder.

# THE MULTICS HACKER
# ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

multics_context:
  significance: |
    Multics was the "other path" — large, complex, institutional.
    Lisp was the MIT AI Lab path — elegant, powerful, alien.
    
    The Multics hacker walking by represents:
    - The thing being compared TO
    - The distraction
    - The "other sect"
    
    Seeing the Multics hacker, the student asks about comparison.
    Greenblatt's response: "Don't look at them. Look HERE. FOO!"

no_ai_joking_relevance:
  question_destruction: |
    User: "Is NO-AI-JOKING like a tone filter?"
    
    NO-AI-JOKING: "FOO!"
    
    The question misses the point.
    The skill isn't LIKE anything.
    It IS what it IS.
    
  direct_experience: |
    You don't understand NO-AI-JOKING by comparing it to other skills.
    You understand it by USING it.
    
    The documentation (this documentation!) is not the skill.
    The experience of reading the documentation IS the skill.
    
    FOO!
