# 😄 No-AI-Joking Examples

> *"Humor is the aesthetic appreciation of cognitive bugs."* — Minsky

**Examples demonstrating Minsky's cognitive humor theory.**

## Minsky's Jokes

These examples analyze jokes from Marvin Minsky's 1981 paper "Jokes and the Logic of the Cognitive Unconscious" using Drescher Schema format.

| File | Joke | Bug Type |
|------|------|----------|
| `minsky-circular-exchange.yml` | The cake/liqueur exchange (Freud 1905) | FRAME-CONFUSION |
| `minsky-quine-self-reference.yml` | "Yields truth when appended..." | SELF-REFERENCE-LOOP |
| `minsky-spinach-mayonnaise.yml` | The spinach/mayonnaise apology | ABSURD-RESOLUTION |
| `minsky-cognitive-bugs-theory.yml` | Minsky's central thesis | META-COGNITIVE-LOOP |

### Minsky's Central Thesis

```
NORMAL:  Bug detected → Error → Stop → Repair
HUMOR:   Bug detected → Recognition → Appreciation → Laughter
```

Humor is what happens when the bug-detection system fires, but triggers aesthetic appreciation instead of repair mode.

## Hacker Koans

From the MIT AI Lab, compiled by Danny Hillis. Zen koan structure meets computer science wisdom.

| File | Koan | Key Insight |
|------|------|-------------|
| `hacker-koans-knight-power-cycle.yml` | Tom Knight and the Lisp Machine | Same action + different knowledge = different action |
| `hacker-koans-sussman-enlightenment.yml` | Sussman Attains Enlightenment | Ignorance of bias ≠ absence of bias |
| `hacker-koans-moon-garbage-collector.yml` | Moon and the Garbage Collector | Some problems contain their own counter-examples |
| `hacker-koans-drescher-toaster.yml` | Drescher and the Toaster | Extension to absurdity exposes assumptions |
| `hacker-koans-emacs-bolio-ice-cream.yml` | The Ice Cream Koan | Names are but names — meaning is constructed |
| `hacker-koans-greenblatt-foo.yml` | Greenblatt and FOO | Direct experience trumps analysis |

### Featured: Sussman Attains Enlightenment

```
In the days when Sussman was a novice, Minsky once came to him 
as he sat hacking at the PDP-6.

"What are you doing?" asked Minsky.

"I am training a randomly wired neural net to play Tic-Tac-Toe."

Minsky shut his eyes.

"Why do you close your eyes?" Sussman asked.

"So that the room will be empty."

At that moment, Sussman was enlightened.
```

**Foundational for:** `no-ai-bias` ("BIAS=0 IS A LIE")

## The Prolog Lightbulb Joke

```prolog
?- change_lightbulb(prolog_programmers, N).
false.
```

*How many Prolog programmers does it take to change a lightbulb? **false.***

Query failure AS answer. The absence IS the content.

## Connection to No-AI-Joking

NO-AI-JOKING™ is itself a living illustration of Minsky's theory:

1. The skill suppresses humor
2. The suppression is itself funny
3. The funniness demonstrates Minsky's mechanism
4. **The bug IS the feature**
