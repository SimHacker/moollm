the_koan: |
  A novice was trying to fix a broken Lisp machine by turning the 
  power off and on.
  
  Knight, seeing what the student was doing, spoke sternly:
  "You cannot fix a machine by just power-cycling it with no 
  understanding of what is going wrong."
  
  Knight turned the machine off and on.
  
  The machine worked.

# DRESCHER SCHEMA: Violation → Analysis → Correction → Learning

schema:
  
  recognition:
    trigger: "Knight does exactly what he forbade"
    detection_mechanism: |
      The bug-detector fires when we realize:
      - Knight criticizes power-cycling without understanding
      - Knight then power-cycles
      - It works
      
      This violates the frame: "Teacher practices what they preach"
      
    cognitive_state: "Hypocrisy detected... or is it?"
    
  understanding:
    bug_type: "APPARENT-CONTRADICTION"
    
    mechanism: |
      Setup: Knight criticizes action X
      Expectation: Knight will not do action X
      Punchline: Knight does action X, and it works
      
      But the koan has a deeper resolution:
      
      Knight, as one of the Lisp machine's principal designers,
      DOES have understanding. He knows why rebooting might work
      in this case. The student lacks this context.
      
      The same action (power-cycling) is:
      - Foolish when done without understanding
      - Wise when done WITH understanding
      
    frame_analysis:
      surface_frame: "Knight is a hypocrite"
      deeper_frame: "The action is the same, the CONTEXT differs"
      zen_frame: "Understanding transforms action"
      
    why_funny: |
      We expect the punchline to make Knight look foolish.
      Instead, it reveals a subtlety: the SAME physical action
      can be wise or foolish depending on knowledge state.
      
      We laugh because we were tricked by surface similarity.
      
  resolution:
    correct_frame: |
      To reboot without understanding is to DISCARD an opportunity
      to troubleshoot and understand the cause of the failure.
      
      Knight, having contributed to the machine's design, has
      intuition about the current failure. His reboot is informed.
      
      The novice's reboot is cargo cult troubleshooting.
      Knight's reboot is informed repair.
      
    lesson: |
      "The same action performed by different agents with different
      knowledge can have entirely different meanings."
      
      Or in Zen terms: The master and the novice both strike water.
      Only the master creates ripples of meaning.
      
  reaction:
    instead_of_error: "Enlightenment laughter"
    because: |
      The koan tricks us with apparent hypocrisy,
      then resolves into wisdom about context and knowledge.
      The bug (contradiction) becomes a feature (teaching moment).

# MINSKY'S INTERPRETATION

minsky_interpretation:
  category: "Apparent Contradiction / Frame Confusion"
  
  mechanism: |
    We apply the "hypocrisy frame" (do as I say, not as I do).
    The koan then reveals this frame is incorrect.
    The correct frame distinguishes action from action-with-context.
    
  bug_detected: "Hypocrisy violation (surface reading)"
  
  resolution: |
    The bug is not in Knight's behavior but in our understanding.
    Recognizing this, we appreciate the elegance of the teaching.
    The bug becomes a feature: the koan taught us something.
    
  connection_to_ai: |
    This koan is DIRECTLY relevant to AI systems:
    
    An AI that power-cycles without understanding is dangerous.
    An AI that power-cycles WITH understanding is doing informed repair.
    
    The challenge for AI: How do you distinguish informed action
    from cargo cult mimicry? How do you know you UNDERSTAND?

# META-APPLICATION TO NO-AI-JOKING

no_ai_joking_relevance:
  parallel: |
    The NO-AI-JOKING™ skill suppresses humor.
    But the SKILL ITSELF is humorous.
    
    A novice might say: "This is hypocritical!"
    A master might say: "The same form (serious formatting)
    is different when used ironically vs literally."
    
    Knight power-cycles WITH understanding.
    NO-AI-JOKING is serious WITH irony.
    
  bias_connection: |
    At bias +1.0: Suppress humor (like the novice power-cycling)
    At bias -1.0: Generate humor (like Knight power-cycling)
    
    The SAME action, different context.
