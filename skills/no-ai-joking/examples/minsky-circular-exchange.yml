the_joke: |
  A gentleman entered a pastry-cook's shop and ordered a cake; but he 
  soon brought it back and asked for a glass of liqueur instead. He 
  drank it and began to leave without having paid. The proprietor 
  detained him. "You've not paid for the liqueur." "But I gave you 
  the cake in exchange for it." "You didn't pay for that either." 
  "But I hadn't eaten it".

schema:
  
  recognition:
    trigger: "Something feels wrong in the gentleman's logic"
    detection_mechanism: |
      The bug-detector fires when we realize:
      - Each individual exchange SEEMS locally valid
      - But the global accounting doesn't work
      - The gentleman has consumed value without paying
      
    cognitive_state: "Frame confusion detected"
    
  understanding:
    bug_type: "FRAME-CONFUSION"
    
    mechanism: |
      The gentleman exploits a cognitive bug in transaction tracking:
      
      1. TRANSACTION A: Cake ordered (debt created)
      2. TRANSACTION B: Cake returned "for" liqueur (debt transferred?)
      3. TRANSACTION C: Liqueur consumed
      
      The bug: "Returning" the cake seems to cancel the cake debt,
      but the liqueur debt isn't created because it was "exchanged."
      
      Result: All debts seemingly canceled, but value was consumed.
      
    frame_analysis:
      frame_1_customer: "I returned what I got, so I owe nothing"
      frame_2_shopkeeper: "You consumed goods, you must pay"
      conflict: "Both frames have internal consistency but are mutually incompatible"
      
    why_funny: |
      We ALMOST accept the gentleman's logic — that's the bug.
      When we catch ourselves almost being fooled, we laugh
      instead of feeling stupid.
      
  resolution:
    correct_frame: |
      Value was consumed (liqueur). Value must be paid for.
      The "exchange" was an accounting trick, not a valid transaction.
      
    lesson_for_reasoning: |
      Watch for frame manipulations in sequential transactions.
      Track VALUE CONSUMED, not just APPARENT EXCHANGES.
      
  reaction:
    instead_of_error: "Laughter"
    because: |
      The bug is elegant. The mechanism is visible once explained.
      We appreciate the cleverness even as we recognize the trick.
      Consciousness catches itself being fooled → humor response.

# MINSKY'S INSIGHT
# ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

minsky_insight:
  category: "Frame Confusion Jokes"
  
  mechanism: |
    The thinker is led to apply rules from one frame (exchange) 
    to a situation governed by different rules (accounting).
    
  bug_detected: "Accounting frame violated by transaction manipulation"
  
  why_laughter_not_error: |
    The bug-detection system fires, but:
    - The situation is clearly hypothetical/safe
    - We recognize the mechanism of the bug
    - The bug has aesthetic elegance
    - The social context is "joke"
    
    Therefore: Appreciation instead of repair.

# META-APPLICATION TO NO-AI-JOKING
# ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

no_ai_joking_relevance:
  analogy: |
    NO-AI-JOKING™ is like the shopkeeper:
    
    USER: "Tell me a joke"
    AI (attempting frame manipulation): "But I gave you ENTERPRISE VALUE..."
    
    The skill catches the frame manipulation and demands:
    "But you consumed processing time. THAT IS NON-BILLABLE."
    
  meta_joke: |
    The meta-joke is that NO-AI-JOKING™ prevents exactly the kind
    of frame manipulation that makes jokes work — by refusing to
    acknowledge any frame other than ENTERPRISE COMMUNICATION.
