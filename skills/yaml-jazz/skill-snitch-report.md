# Skill Snitch Report: yaml-jazz

**Date:** 2026-01-28  
**Auditor:** Deep Probe  
**Verdict:** THE COMMENTS ARE THE DATA

---

## Executive Summary

**Semantic YAML where comments are first-class data.**

LLMs read and interpret comments. Structure is for humans AND machines AND LLMs.

JavaScript gives you data. YAML Jazz gives you DATA + MEANING + CONTEXT + REASONING.

## What YAML Jazz Adds

| Feature | What It Means |
|---------|---------------|
| **Comments as data** | The WHY travels with the WHAT |
| **Inline context** | Self-documenting structures |
| **Multiline prose** | Formatted explanations |
| **Nested reasoning** | Investigation plans, inner voice |
| **Git-friendly** | Semantic diffs, not character shuffles |

## Three Audiences

```
        YAML Jazz
            │
    ┌───────┼───────┐
    ▼       ▼       ▼
 Humans   LLMs  Machines
(intent) (context) (logic)
```

## Directories as Interests

> "When an LLM lists a directory, filenames serve as VIRTUAL INTERESTS."

Well-written filenames are LLM-recognizable K-lines.

**Big-endian naming:**
```
✓ 2026-01-24-mafia-tribute.yml   (date first)
✗ mafia-tribute-2026-01-24.yml   (date buried)
```

## Empirical Evidence

**Sunil Kumar (Groundlight AI, 2025):**

> "YAML for tool calling massively improved generation entropy stability vs JSON."

JSON's strict syntax constrains the model's ability to search and reason.

## Methods

| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **IMPROVISE** | Create YAML Jazz structure |
| **INTERPRET** | Read semantically |

---

## Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **comments-matter** | Comments are semantic data |
| **structure-guides** | Hierarchy implies relationship |
| **flexibility** | Accept variations, emit consistency |
| **human-readable** | Optimize for understanding |
| **entropy-preservation** | YAML preserves; JSON collapses |
| **directories-as-interests** | Listings ARE the interest index |
| **big-endian-naming** | Most significant first |

---

## Security Assessment

### Concerns

None. It's a design philosophy for YAML.

**Risk Level:** ZERO — pure methodology

---

## Verdict

**COMMENTS AS SEMANTIC DATA. APPROVE.**

The comments ARE the data.

Three audiences: humans, LLMs, machines.
