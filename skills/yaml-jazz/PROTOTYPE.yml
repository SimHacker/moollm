description: "Semantic YAML interpretation where comments carry meaning"

# The skill itself demonstrates the principle:
# - These comments are instructions
# - Structure implies priority
# - The LLM should read ALL of this

principles:
  - name: comments_matter
    # Most important! Never strip comments.
    rule: "Comments are data, not decoration"
    
  - name: structure_is_semantic
    rule: "Order, grouping, and indentation carry meaning"
    # First item = highest priority
    
  - name: improvise_within_constraints
    rule: "Fill gaps reasonably, note uncertainty"
    # Like jazz: follow the changes, make it your own

  When reading YAML Jazz:
  1. Read ALL comments — they're instructions
  2. Note the ordering — it implies priority
  3. Infer from context — but flag assumptions
  4. Preserve soul — don't strip meaning
  
  When writing YAML Jazz:
  1. Comment your reasoning
  2. Order by importance
  3. Group related items
  4. Leave room for interpretation

# Example of improvisational extension:
# An LLM might add fields like this:
_llm_notes:
  confidence: high
  assumptions:
    - "User prefers concise comments"
    - "Standard YAML 1.2 syntax"
  last_interpreted: "2024-01-15"
