# 🎷 "The comments ARE the data."

what: |
  Semantic YAML where comments are first-class data.
  LLMs read and interpret comments.
  Structure for humans AND machines AND LLMs.

why: |
  - Comments as semantic data
  - Three audiences served
  - Entropy preserved (JSON collapses)
  - Git-friendly diffs
  - Directories as interests

when:
  - '"Need LLM-readable YAML" → IMPROVISE'
  - '"Read semantic YAML" → INTERPRET'
  - '"Design file structure" → follow principles'

methods:
  IMPROVISE: "Create YAML Jazz structure"
  INTERPRET: "Read semantically"

what_yaml_adds:
  - "Comments as data — WHY travels with WHAT"
  - "Inline context — self-documenting"
  - "Multiline prose — formatted explanations"
  - "Nested reasoning — inner voice"
  - "Git-friendly — semantic diffs"

three_audiences: |
  YAML Jazz serves:
  • Humans — read comments, understand intent
  • LLMs — read everything, understand context
  • Machines — parse structure, execute logic

directories_as_interests: |
  Filenames are LLM-recognizable K-lines.
  Directory listing IS the interest index.
  Big-endian naming: 2026-01-24-description.yml

principles:
  comments_matter: "Comments are semantic data"
  structure_guides: "Hierarchy implies relationship"
  flexibility: "Accept variations, emit consistency"
  entropy_preservation: "YAML preserves; JSON collapses"
  big_endian_naming: "Most significant first"
