    Semantic YAML where comments are first-class data.
    The LLM reads and interprets comments. Structure is
    for humans AND machines AND LLMs.

# YAML JAZZ vs JSON
# JSON gives you data. YAML Jazz gives you data + meaning + context.

    - "Comments as semantic data — the WHY travels with the WHAT"
    - "Multiline prose — formatted, readable explanations"

    Sunil Kumar (Groundlight AI, 2025): YAML for tool calling
    "massively improved generation entropy stability" vs JSON.

example: |
  # A character's inner conflict
  # The LLM reads this and understands the dramatic tension
  conflict:
    surface: "Wants to be brave"
    hidden: "Terrified of failure"
    # The tension between these drives the story
