    Semantic YAML where comments are first-class data.
    The LLM reads and interprets comments. Structure is
    for humans AND machines AND LLMs.

yaml_vs_javascript:
  summary: |
    JavaScript gives you data.
    YAML Jazz gives you DATA + MEANING + CONTEXT + REASONING.
    
  what_js_cannot_express:
    - "Comments as semantic data — the WHY travels with the WHAT"
    - "Inline context — self-documenting structures"
    - "Multiline prose — formatted, readable explanations"
    - "Nested reasoning — investigation plans, inner voice"
    - "Git-friendly diffs — semantic changes, not character shuffles"
    
  serves_three_audiences:
    - "Humans — read comments, understand intent"
    - "LLMs — read everything, understand context"
    - "Machines — parse structure, execute logic"

# DIRECTORIES AS INTERESTS
# A fundamental organizing principle for LLM navigation

directories_as_interests:
  concept: |
    When an LLM lists a directory, the filenames serve as 
    VIRTUAL INTERESTS — semantic signals about what's available.
    
    Well-written filenames are LLM-recognizable K-lines.
    The `ls` output IS the index. No separate index file needed.
    
  big_endian_naming: |
    Most significant component FIRST:
    
    ✓ 2026-01-24-mafia-tribute-relationship.yml   (date first)
    ✗ mafia-tribute-relationship-2026-01-24.yml   (date buried)
    
    ✓ RUN-001-amsterdam-fluxx.yml                 (run number first)
    ✗ amsterdam-fluxx-run-001.yml                 (identifier buried)
    
    Why: Sorting groups by significance. Date-first groups by time.
    Number-first groups by sequence. The LLM sees the pattern.
    
  directories_as_outlines: |
    A directory structure IS an outline the LLM can navigate:
    
    skills/
    ├── no-ai-gloss/          ← "Semantic hygiene"
    │   ├── CARD.yml          ← Quick interface
    │   ├── SKILL.md          ← Deep protocol
    │   └── examples/         ← Learning artifacts
    │       ├── INDEX.yml
    │       └── 2026-01-24-mafia-tribute-*.yml
    └── no-ai-slop/           ← "Syntactic hygiene"
        └── ...
    
    The LLM reads structure. Each level reveals more detail.
    Directories are expandable outlines.
    
  filenames_as_klines: |
    A good filename activates semantic understanding:
    
    "2026-01-24-euphemism-laundering-mafia-tribute.yml"
    
    The LLM sees: date, concept, metaphor — before opening the file.
    This is a K-line: the name activates related knowledge.
    
  seamless_embedding: |
    YAML Jazz structures can embed skill instances:
    
    room:
      objects:
        - !include objects/lamp.yml
        - !include objects/desk.yml
      characters:
        - !include ../characters/palm.yml
        
    Directories become modular components.
    The filesystem IS the object hierarchy.
    
  hierarchical_skills: |
    Skills can exist in hierarchies — nested directories with instances:
    
    skills/
    └── experiment/
        ├── CARD.yml              # Experiment skill definition
        ├── SKILL.md
        ├── templates/
        │   ├── RUN.yml.tmpl      # Template for new runs
        │   └── RUN.md.tmpl
        └── experiments/
            └── fluxx-chaos/
                ├── EXPERIMENT.yml  # This experiment's config
                └── runs/
                    └── amsterdam-flux/
                        ├── RUN.yml       # Run metadata
                        ├── RUN-000.yml   # First iteration
                        ├── RUN-001.yml   # Second iteration
                        ├── RUN-002.yml
                        └── ...
    
    The hierarchy IS the instance tree:
    - skills/experiment/        → The skill
    - experiments/fluxx-chaos/  → An experiment instance
    - runs/amsterdam-flux/      → A run instance
    - RUN-000.yml               → An iteration within the run
    
    Each level inherits from above. Directories scope instances.
    The path IS the context.

# Empirical validation: Sunil Kumar (Groundlight AI, 2025) found that
# switching from JSON to YAML for tool calling "massively improved
# generation entropy stability" during GRPO training. JSON's strict
# syntax constrains the model's ability to search and reason.

example: |
  # A character's inner conflict
  # The LLM reads this and understands the dramatic tension
  conflict:
    surface: "Wants to be brave"
    hidden: "Terrified of failure"
    # The tension between these drives the story
