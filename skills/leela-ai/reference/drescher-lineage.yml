# Drescher–Leela lineage and key concepts
# Focused reference for Leela AI's inspiration from Gary Drescher

lineage:
  piaget:
    role: "Child development — schemas, sensorimotor learning"
    key: "When an action applies; what result it has on the world"
    
  drescher:
    when: "MIT, under Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert"
    work: "Made-Up Minds (1991); Genetic AI: Translating Piaget into Lisp (1986)"
    model: "Robot with hand and eye; act on and observe the world"
    schema: "Context (observable conditions) → Action → Result; reliability tracked"
    planning: "Chain schemas from current state to goal; marginal attribution, synthetic items"
    
  leela_exposure:
    who: "Henry Minsky (student at MIT)"
    when: "1990s; reimplementation ~6–7 years before founding"
    founding: "Henry Minsky, Cyrus Shaoul, Milan Minsky — Leela AI"
    naming: "Leela — Sanskrit 'divine play' (creation, destruction, re-creation)"

schema_mechanism:
  structure:
    context: "Observable world state when action is taken"
    action: "Event performed"
    result: "Observed outcome"
  learning:
    - "Bare schema when effects seem more likely than chance"
    - "Add context when schema fails; refine reliability"
    - "Chain schemas for goal-reaching; planner finds action sequence"
  reliability:
    - "P(result | context, action) vs P(result | context, ¬action)"
    - "Spinoff new schemas when context differentiates; age out unused"

leela_implementation:
  symbolic_core: "Schema system in Python/GPU; block worlds, hand-eye grid"
  neurosymbolic: "ConvNet perception → LeelaCore symbolic reasoning → corrections, self-supervised samples"
  manufacturing: "Video intelligence: object/pose detection + causal inference, explainability"
