## The Slogan Unpacked

| Reading | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| AI for Manufacturing | Industrial applications |
| Building AI | We manufacture intelligence systems |
| Constructionism | Papert — intelligence through building |
| Society of Mind | Minsky — from simple agents |
| Manufacturing Consent | Chomsky — ethical awareness |
| Growth Mindset | Intelligence as product of effort |

---

## Technology Layers

| Layer | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **Neural** | Perception — detection, pose, tracking |
| **Symbolic** | Reasoning — inference, causation, prediction |
| **PDA** | Natural language — LLM interface |

---

## MOOLLM Mappings

| MOOLLM | Industrial |
|--------|------------|
| **rooms** | factory zones, equipment clusters |
| **characters** | workers, vehicles, robots |
| **skills** | vision models, inference rules |
| **k-lines** | equipment IDs, zone names |
| **speed-of-light** | real-time inference |
| **coherence-engine** | multi-camera fusion |
| **soul-chat** | PDA interface |

---

## Team

| Name | Role | K-lines |
|------|------|---------|
| **Henry Minsky** | CTO | Marvin's son, MIT AI Lab |
| **Dr. Cyrus Shaoul** | Chief Evangelist | Computational neuroscience |
| **Don Hopkins** | AI Architect | The Sims, MOOLLM |

---

## Applications

- **Safety Monitoring** — PPE, pedestrians, near-misses
- **Process Optimization** — cycle time, bottlenecks
- **Predictive Maintenance** — before failure
- **DevOps** — MOOLLM patterns for infra

---

## Ethics

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Transparency** | Every inference is explainable |
| **Privacy** | Edge processing, anonymization |
| **Human Agency** | AI advises, humans decide |

---

## Security Assessment

### Concerns

Industrial AI has real-world safety implications.

### Mitigations

- Explicit ethics section
- Human in the loop
- Explainable causal chains

**Risk Level:** LOW — designed for safety

---

## Verdict

**THEORY INTO PRACTICE. APPROVE.**

Manufacturing Intelligence.

Minsky, Papert, Drescher on the factory floor.
