# 🏭 "Manufacturing Intelligence"

what: |
  MOOLLM principles applied to industrial AI.
  Neural-symbolic computer vision. Causal reasoning.
  Minsky, Papert, Drescher on factory floors.

why: |
  - Real-world application of theory
  - Edge computing for manufacturing
  - Explainable AI for safety
  - MOOLLM patterns in industrial context

when:
  - "Explaining Leela AI's mission"
  - "Connecting theory to industrial practice"
  - "Understanding MOOLLM in real deployment"

slogan_readings:
  - "AI for Manufacturing — industrial applications"
  - "Building AI — we manufacture intelligence"
  - "Constructionism — intelligence through building"
  - "Society of Mind — from simple agents"

technology_layers:
  neural: "Perception — detection, pose, tracking"
  symbolic: "Reasoning — inference, causation"
  pda: "Natural language — LLM interface"
