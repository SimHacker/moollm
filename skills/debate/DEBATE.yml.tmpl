# YAML Jazz guidance for the LLM:
# - Ensure sides have genuinely opposing positions
# - Advocates should have complementary, not identical, styles
# - Audience expertise should be relevant to the topic
# - Consider including a "pragmatic" middle-ground side
# - Stakes should make clear why we can't just defer the decision
