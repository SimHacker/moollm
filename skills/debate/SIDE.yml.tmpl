# YAML Jazz guidance:
# - Position should be genuinely debatable, not strawman
# - Advocates should have distinct styles that complement each other
# - Strategy should anticipate real counterarguments
# - Evidence should be varied in type, not all the same kind
# - Constraints make the debate more realistic and interesting
