# GLANCE.yml — sniffable-python
# Full file: CARD.yml (210 lines) | SKILL.md
# 🐍 "Structure code for the first 50 lines."

what: |
  Structure Python so LLMs can sniff the API from the header.
  First 50 lines contain everything needed to use the script.
  Comprehension fidelity > token count.

why: |
  - LLM already knows Python
  - Don't invent new syntax
  - Structure existing syntax
  - Perl's syntax fetish is cautionary

when:
  - '"Generating Python CLI" -> use sniffable structure'
  - '"Understanding script quickly" -> sniff the header'
  - '"Sister script creation" -> follow conventions'

methods:
  SNIFF: "Read API from file header"
  SNIFF_CODE: "Language-agnostic sniffability review"
  GENERATE_SNIFFABLE: "Create from template"
  VALIDATE_SNIFFABLE: "Check conventions"

zones:
  1_shebang_docstring: "Lines 1-15 — purpose, usage"
  2_imports: "Lines 16-22 — dependencies"
  3_constants: "Lines 23-30 — config with comments"
  4_cli_structure: "Lines 31-50 — main() command tree"
  5_implementation: "Lines 51+ — only read if modifying"

checklist:
  - "Shebang line 1"
  - "Module docstring"
  - "Imports grouped"
  - "Constants with comments"
  - "CLI in main() with argparse"
  - "Types in signatures"
  - "Internal funcs prefixed _"

thesis: "Structure existing syntax, don't invent new."
