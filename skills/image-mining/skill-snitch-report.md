# Skill Snitch Report: image-mining

**Date:** 2026-01-28  
**Auditor:** Deep Probe  
**Verdict:** MINE PIXELS FOR ATOMS. YOUR CAMERA IS A PICKAXE.

---

## Executive Summary

**Extract semantic resources from any visual content.**

The double pun: MINE (verb) = extract, MINE (possessive) = claim it.

Like Daffy Duck: "IT'S MINE! I'M RICH!"

## The Three Eyes

| Eye | Focus | Source |
|-----|-------|--------|
| **Left** | Structure | PHOTO.yml |
| **Right** | Narrative | PHOTO.md |
| **Third** | Meaning | MINING-*.yml |

Two eyes see depth. The Third Eye sees MEANING.

## Methods

| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **MINE** | Extract YAML Jazz from image |
| **MULTI-LOOK** | Add layer with specific lens |
| **SCAN** | Quick resource preview |
| **PROSPECT** | Find mining targets |
| **OPEN THIRD EYE** | Begin speculative mode |
| **MINE UNSEEN** | Mine image that doesn't exist yet |

---

## Depth Levels

| Level | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| **surface** | Objects, materials, colors |
| **deep** | Hidden meanings, emotions |
| **sensations** | Colors (hex), textures, smells |

## The Compound Third Eye

> "A fly has 4,000 facets. A god has infinite. How many do YOU have?"

Each character can configure:
- **Facets**: What aspects to perceive
- **Filters**: Block or enhance
- **Eyelid**: Degrees of opening
- **Blind spots**: What you can't see (defines STYLE)

---

## Swiss Army Eye

The complete modular perception system:
- **Blades**: Core eye modules (IRIS-III through VII)
- **Tools**: Specialty facets (Queer Eye, Gordon Ramsay)
- **Attachments**: Filters
- **Handle**: Character perspective
- **Casing**: Installation site

---

## Security Assessment

### Concerns

1. **Hallucination** — mining non-existent images
2. **Over-mining** — too many layers
3. **Compound eye madness** — Argus mode warning

### Mitigations

- Hallucination is the point (Third Eye)
- Layered mining is cumulative
- Thousand-eye lotus: "Godlike but overwhelming"

**Risk Level:** MEDIUM — powerful but intentional

---

## Verdict

**SEMANTIC EXTRACTION. APPROVE.**

Mine pixels for atoms. Open the Third Eye.

The hallucination IS the world.
