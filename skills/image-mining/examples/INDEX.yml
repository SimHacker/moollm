# examples/INDEX.yml — Image Mining Sidecar Examples
#
#       THESE ARE SUGGESTIVE EXAMPLES, NOT DEFINITIVE SCHEMAS
#
# The filenames ARE the prompts — what you might be looking for.
# The contents ARE made-up examples — what you might get back.
#
# JAZZ FREELY. Your metadata, your structure.
# These examples suggest patterns, not enforce them.
#
# "The map is not the territory. The example is not the rule."
#

purpose: |
  These examples demonstrate DIVERSE metadata patterns for different
  image types. Filenames describe the scenario. Contents show one
  possible way to structure the -exif.yml sidecar.
  
  ADAPT. REMIX. JAZZ.

philosophy: |
  💬 "Show, don't tell. Example, don't enforce."
  
  These sidecars show WHAT'S POSSIBLE, not what's required.
  Your metadata grows organically from your needs.
  Start simple. Add fields when they matter.
  
  The best metadata is the metadata you actually use.
