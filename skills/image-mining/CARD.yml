# CARD.yml — Image Mining (condensed)

card:
  id: image-mining
  name: "Image Mining"
  type: [skill, vision, extraction, automation]
  emoji: "⛏️📷"
  rarity: uncommon
  tagline: "Mine pixels for atoms. Your camera is a pickaxe."
  description: |
    Extract semantic resources from visual content (photos, screenshots,
    diagrams, PDFs) and produce YAML Jazz with quantities, observations,
    and interpretations.

invoke_when:
  - "Need structured extraction from an image"
  - "Summarizing visuals into YAML Jazz"
  - "Comparing multiple images by the same lens"

concepts:
  mining: "Images are ore; YAML Jazz is refined output"
  third_eye: "Speculative mining for meaning beyond the pixels"
  layers: "Multiple passes can append lenses or perspectives"
