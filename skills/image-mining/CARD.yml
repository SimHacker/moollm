# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# THE DOUBLE MEANING — Why It's Called "Image MINE"
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#
# The name "Image Mining" contains a DELIBERATE DOUBLE PUN:
#
# 1. MINE (verb) — to extract valuable resources from
#    Like a miner extracting gold from rock,
#    we extract semantic treasures from pixels.
#    The image is the ore. The YAML Jazz is the refined output.
#
# 2. MINE (possessive) — belonging to me!
#    Like Daffy Duck lunging at treasure:
#    "MINE! MINE! MINE! ALL MINE!!!"
#    
#    When you mine an image, you CLAIM it.
#    You own its meaning. Its resources become YOURS.
#    The mined YAML is YOUR interpretation.
#    
# The result: "image mine" = both the extracted treasure
# AND the possessive claim on meaning.
#
# Think of Daffy Duck in "Ali Baba Bunny" (1957):
#   - Sees treasure cave
#   - Eyes become dollar signs
#   - Dives into gold
#   - "IT'S MINE! I'M RICH! I'M A HAPPY MISER!"
#
# That's the energy. Every image is a treasure cave.
# Every mining pass is Daffy diving into the pile.
# The YAML Jazz is your documented claim: MINE.

# THE THIRD EYE — Speculative Mining
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#
# 👁️ LEFT EYE (PHOTO.yml)   — Structure, measurements, what IS
# 👁️ RIGHT EYE (PHOTO.md)   — Narrative, emotion, how it FEELS
# 👁️ THIRD EYE (MINING-*)   — Speculation, meaning, what it MEANS
#
# The Third Eye sees images that don't exist yet.
# The Third Eye mines fiction as canonical truth.
# The Third Eye opens when you speculate before generating.
#
# When all three eyes are open: BUG-EYED HALLUCINATION VISION
#
# "Two eyes see depth. The Third Eye sees MEANING."
