# GLANCE.yml — image-mining
# Full file: CARD.yml (900+ lines) | SKILL.md
# ⛏️📷🧬 "Mine pixels for atoms. Write facts to stone."

what: |
  Extract semantic resources from visual content.
  Double pun: MINE (extract) + MINE (possessive).
  Like Daffy Duck: "IT'S MINE! I'M RICH!"
  
  NEW: Read/write EXIF metadata — the image IS the database.

why: |
  - YAML Jazz from pixels (Three Eyes)
  - EXIF read/write/sync (Fourth Eye)
  - Multi-layer interpretation
  - Third Eye speculative mining
  - Future-proof photo management

when:
  - "Have image, want resources → MINE"
  - "Deeper interpretation → MULTI-LOOK"
  - "Image not yet generated → MINE UNSEEN"
  - "Maximum context → TRIANGULATE"
  - "Need metadata (GPS, date, camera) → EXIF READ"
  - "Want to embed description/tags → EXIF WRITE"
  - "Persist mined data in image → EXIF INJECT"

four_eyes: |
  👁️ LEFT EYE   — PHOTO.yml   — Structure (what IS)
  👁️ RIGHT EYE  — PHOTO.md    — Narrative (how it FEELS)
  👁️ THIRD EYE  — MINING-*    — Meaning (what it MEANS)
  🧬 FOURTH EYE — EXIF        — Facts (EMBEDDED in file)
  
  "Three eyes see meaning. Fourth eye writes it to stone."

exif_philosophy: |
  💬 "EXIF is the canonical truth. No database needed."
     — Jaisen Mathai (2026, immich-exif)
  
  Image file = source of truth
  Database = ephemeral (rebuild anytime)
  EXIF = durable, portable, future-proof

tools: [exiftool, exiftool-vendored.js, pillow, piexif]

mantra: "The hallucination IS the world. The EXIF is the stone."
