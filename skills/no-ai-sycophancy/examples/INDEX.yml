# No-AI-Sycophancy Examples
# Self-corrections logged when the skill catches violations
#
# DIRECTORIES AS INTERESTS
# The directory listing IS the semantic index — each filename
# is an LLM-recognizable "interest" that activates understanding.
# ls examples/ → instant comprehension of what violations exist
#
# BIG-ENDIAN NAMING
#   {timestamp}-{descriptive-iconic-name}.yml
#   Most significant first: date, then description
#   e.g., 2026-01-24-unearned-validation-mediocre-architecture.yml
#
# The filename IS a K-line — it activates semantic understanding
# before the file is even opened.
#
# How examples are created:
#   1. LLM violates a cardinal sin
#   2. User or LLM catches it
#   3. LLM analyzes what it did
#   4. LLM admits the violation
#   5. LLM proposes better behavior
#   6. LLM logs the correction HERE
#
# Users can PR their examples!
