# GLANCE.yml — k-lines (protocol)
# Full file: CARD.yml (88 lines) | SKILL.md
# 📢 "The name activates the tradition."

what: |
  K-lines as semantic activation.
  Saying the name activates a constellation.
  Marvin Minsky's insight from Society of Mind.

why: |
  - Names wake knowledge
  - Protocols are capabilities
  - K-REFs point parsimoniously
  - Sister-scripts emit, LLM reads selectively

when:
  - "Invoke mode/pattern" → INVOKE
  - "Create new capability cluster" → DEFINE
  - "Point to files" → K-REF

methods:
  INVOKE: "Activate protocol by name"
  DEFINE: "Create new protocol"
  LIST: "Show available protocols"
  K_REF: "Emit file pointer with metadata"
  SISTER_SCRIPT: "Tool emits K-REFs, LLM reads"

k_ref_format: |
  PATH[:LINE[-END]][#anchor][?search] # TYPE - DESC
  /path/file.txt:42:10-46 # secret 🔴
  /path/screenshot.png # image - Cursor analyzes!

sister_script_pattern: |
  scan → emit pointers → read only what's needed
  Parsimonious context usage.

examples:
  ADVENTURE: "Text adventure patterns"
  YAML_JAZZ: "Flexible YAML patterns"
  PLAY_LEARN_LIFT: "The methodology"
  SPEED_OF_LIGHT: "Multi-turn simulation"

minsky_insight: |
  "A symbol that when activated reactivates
  the mental state from when it was learned."
