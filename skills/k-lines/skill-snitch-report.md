# Skill Snitch Report: k-lines (protocol)

**Date:** 2026-01-28  
**Auditor:** Deep Probe  
**Verdict:** THE NAME ACTIVATES THE TRADITION

---

## Executive Summary

**K-lines as semantic activation.**

Marvin Minsky's insight: saying the name activates a constellation of knowledge and behavior.

YAML-JAZZ invokes YAML Jazz. ADVENTURE invokes text adventure.

---

## The Minsky Insight

> "A symbol that when activated reactivates the mental state from when it was learned."

| Protocol | What It Activates |
|----------|-------------------|
| ADVENTURE | Text adventure patterns |
| YAML-JAZZ | Flexible YAML patterns |
| PLAY-LEARN-LIFT | The methodology |
| SPEED-OF-LIGHT | Multi-turn simulation |

---

## Methods

| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **INVOKE** | Activate protocol by name |
| **DEFINE** | Create new protocol |
| **LIST** | Show available protocols |
| **K-REF** | Emit file pointer with metadata |
| **SISTER-SCRIPT** | Tool emits K-REFs, LLM reads selectively |

---

## K-REF Format

```
PATH[:LINE[-END]][#anchor][?search] # TYPE - DESC
```

Examples:
- `/path/file.txt:42:10-46 # secret 🔴`
- `/path/screenshot.png # image - Cursor reads and analyzes!`

Cursor can read ANYWHERE on disk, including images.

---

## Sister-Script Pattern

```
scan → emit pointers → read only what's needed
```

Parsimonious context usage. Don't read everything—point to it.

---

## Security Assessment

### Concerns

1. **K-REF scope** — Cursor reads anywhere on disk
2. **Protocol hijacking** — malicious K-line definitions

### Mitigations

- K-REFs are pointers, not execution
- Protocol definitions visible in PROTOCOLS.yml

**Risk Level:** LOW — it's just naming

---

## Lineage

**Marvin Minsky** — K-lines, Society of Mind (1986)

---

## Verdict

**MINSKY'S GIFT. APPROVE.**

The name activates the tradition.

Say the word. Wake the constellation.
