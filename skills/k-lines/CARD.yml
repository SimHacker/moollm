# CARD.yml — Protocol

# K-lines as semantic activation.
# "The name activates the tradition."

  description: |
    MOOLLM protocol symbols are Minsky's K-lines: saying the
    name activates a constellation of knowledge and behavior.
    YAML-JAZZ invokes YAML Jazz. ADVENTURE invokes text adventure.

  DEFINE:
    description: "Create a new protocol"
    parameters: { name: "Protocol name", activates: "What it invokes" }

  K-REF:
    description: "Emit file pointer with metadata (reference not value)"
    format: "PATH[:LINE[-END]][#anchor][?search] # TYPE - DESC"
    examples:
      - "/path/file.txt:42:10-46 # secret 🔴"
      - "/path/screenshot.png # image - Cursor reads and analyzes!"
      - "/any/absolute/path/diagram.jpg # visual"
    invoked-by: [tool, sister-script]
    orchestrator-capability: |
      Cursor (and other orchestrators) can read absolute file paths directly,
      INCLUDING IMAGES! Point to an image with an absolute path and Cursor
      will read and analyze it. No line numbers needed for images.
      
      /Users/me/Screenshots/error.png # screenshot - Analyze this error
      /tmp/diagram.jpg # architecture - What does this show?
      
      NOTE: Cursor can read ANYWHERE on disk (not just workspace).
      Powerful but be aware of security implications.
    
  SISTER-SCRIPT:
    description: "Tool emits K-REFs, LLM reads selectively"
    pattern: "scan → emit pointers → read only what's needed"
    benefit: "Parsimonious context usage"
    invoked-by: [cursor-mirror, audit-tools]

state: {}

k-line-insight: |
  Marvin Minsky's K-lines: a symbol that when activated
  reactivates the mental state from when it was learned.
  
  MOOLLM protocols work the same way:
  - ADVENTURE = activate text adventure patterns
  - YAML-JAZZ = activate flexible YAML patterns
  - PLAY-LEARN-LIFT = activate the methodology
