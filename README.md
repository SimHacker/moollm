# MOOLLM 🐒🚉✨

> **I am a place you can live in.**

Not a tool you use. Not a service you call. A *world* you inhabit.

When you enter MOOLLM, you do not "prompt" — you **move**. Directories are rooms. Files are things you can touch. Names wake constellations of meaning.

**The Sims meets LambdaMOO, running in Cursor.**

A filesystem-incarnated skill framework — a microworld OS for LLM agents. 117 skills and counting. The LLM interprets them. Empathy is the interface.

---

## Quick Start

**Skip to the demo:**

1. **[Lane Neverending Photo Archive](./examples/adventure-4/street/lane-neverending/slideshow/SLIDESHOW.md)** — Generated images with semantic mining layers
2. **[The Pub](./examples/adventure-4/pub/)** — Directories of YAML Jazz and README files, rooms you can explore
3. **[MOOLLM Interviews Itself](./examples/adventure-4/characters/real-people/don-hopkins/sessions/2026-01-28-moollm-interview.md)** — Narrative play, self-reflection, and an Irn Bru snowman flight

**Get playing:**

- [QUICKSTART.md](./QUICKSTART.md) — "Get playing in 2 minutes"

> ⏳ First time? Wait for Cursor indexing to complete.  
> **Settings → Cursor Settings → Indexing → Codebase Indexing** → 100%

## What Is This?

**MOOLLM** = Microworld Operating system for Orchestrated LLM Living Memory

- **Directories are rooms** — navigation is movement
- **Files are objects and state** — presence activates content
- **Names are semantic triggers** — they wake constellations of meaning (K-lines)
- **Skills are programs** — the LLM is `eval()`
- **Comments are meaningful data** — YAML Jazz with rich annotations

**Core insight:** Skills are not documentation. They are programs. The LLM interprets them.

> **Skills are programs. The LLM is `eval()`. Empathy is the interface.**

## Highlights

### It remembers

Not just your last message — your whole story. Sessions become literature. Characters grow souls. The [pub](./examples/adventure-4/pub/) remembers who sat where. The [guestbook](./examples/adventure-4/pub/guestbook/) keeps their signatures.

### It thinks out loud

YAML comments are not decoration — they are inner monologue. You can read its reasoning. It can read yours. You think *together* in plain text. This is **YAML Jazz**.

### It contains multitudes

117 skills. Minsky's agents. Wright's Sims. Papert's microworlds. Curtis's MUD rooms. Ungar's prototypes. All composing, delegating, inheriting. Intelligence emerges from the ensemble.

GET [object]            # Add to inventory
SUMMON [character]      # Invoke a character
AS [character]          # Switch who you're playing
SPEED-OF-LIGHT [n]      # Simulate n turns at once

## The Lineage

This is not new. It is an unbroken thread from Engelbart to Kay to Minsky to Papert to Curtis to Wright — finally running on language.

See [indexes/PIONEERS.md](./indexes/PIONEERS.md) for the full genealogy.

*Come in. Look around. The pub remembers who sat where.*
